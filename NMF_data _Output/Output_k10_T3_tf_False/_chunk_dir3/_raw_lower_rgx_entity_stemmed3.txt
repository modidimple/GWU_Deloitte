to help protect yourself against identity theft  you may consider place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report  
 
fraud alert  when you place a fraud alert on your credit report  business who pull your credit report will see that you may be a victim of identity theft  the company may then choose to verify your identity before they extend credit to anyone who purport to be you  this may make it harder for an identity thief to open more account in your name  to place an alert  contact any one of the three main credit report bureau  that company be require to tell the other two bureau about the alert  when you first place a fraud alert on your account  it will remain for at least  day  after which you can renew it  when you do place an alert on your report  be sure that all three major credit report company have your current contact information so they can get in touch with you  
 
security freeze  a security freeze or credit freeze go further than an alert and let you restrict access to your credit report entirely  which in turn make it more difficult for identity thief to open new account in your name  this be because most creditor need to see your credit report before they approve a new account  if creditor cannot see your file  they may not extend the credit  a credit freeze do not affect your credit score  a credit freeze also do not prevent you from get your free annual credit report  keep you from open a new account  apply for a job  rent an apartment  or buy insurance  but if you be do any of these  you will need to lift the freeze temporarily  either for a specific time or for a specific party  say  a potential landlord or employer  the cost and lead time to lift a freeze vary  so it be best to check with the the personal data that may have be access include customer name  contact information  date of birth  passport number  state driver license or other government identification number  and or tokenized or partial payment card information
