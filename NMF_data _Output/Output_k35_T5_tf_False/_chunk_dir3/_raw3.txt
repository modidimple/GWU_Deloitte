Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

Root Insurance Company (Root) understands the importance of protecting personal information. We are writing to inform you about an incident that involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you may consider taking.

What Happened?

We identified an unusual account creation pattern on January 28, 2021, and now believe that activity began in the week before that date. Accounts were being created for individuals with whom Root had no prior relationship by using names and dates of birth, which were not obtained from Root, to get an insurance quote through our website. We immediately began an investigation and notified law enforcement.

What Information Was Involved?

By creating new accounts, an application prefill process was triggered which populated the following information in the account: your driver's license number, date of birth, and vehicle information (vehicle identification number, year, make and model). Please NOTE that you may have been identified in our investigation because you did attempt to get an insurance quote through Root's website between January 21 and 31, 2021. Your ability to receive a quote or purchase a Root insurance policy may have been stopped because out of an abundance of caution we stopped certain quote and policy purchase activity in order to shut down what appeared to be suspicious activity.

What You Can Do:

We have secured the services of Experian to offer you a complimentary one-year membership to Experian's IdentityWorksSM. This product helps detect possible misuse of your information and provides you with identity protection support focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorks is completely free and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on IdentityWorks, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take to protect yourself, please see the pages that follow this letter.

We are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that we are taking in response. We have already implemented additional security measures to enhance the security of our application process.

For More Information:

We regret any concern this incident may cause. If you have questions, please call the dedicated call center established for this matter at 1-855-774-0471, Monday through Friday, between 9:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., Eastern Time.

Dear Attorney General Thomas J. Miller:

On behalf of my client, The Kroger Co. and its affiliated companies (Kroger), I write to notify you of a data security incident affecting Accellion, which is used by Kroger and many other companies for secure file transfers. Accellion has confirmed that an unauthorized person gained access to certain Kroger files by exploiting a vulnerability in Accellion's file transfer service on approximately December 24-29, 2020.

Kroger learned of the impact to certain of its files on January 23, 2021, and took action to discontinue use of Accellion's services, report the incident to federal law enforcement, and investigate the scope and impact of the incident. Kroger's own IT systems have not been affected by this incident.

Kroger's investigation has now concluded, and we are able to confirm that the final number of impacted Iowa residents is approximately 1,200 individuals. Kroger began notifying impacted individuals on February 19, 2021, including an offer of two years of complementary credit monitoring through Experian; notification is expected to be complete by March 17, 2021. Sample notification letters sent to Iowa residents are enclosed for your reference.

Impacted Iowa resident information includes certain employee or former employee information, such as names, contact information, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and for some employees or former employees, salary information such as net and gross pay and withholdings, and benefits information from the Kroger Employee Health Plan, including plan, prescription ID and certain claims processing details. Information from Kroger's Pharmacies or The Little Clinic customers may include names, contact information, dates of birth, social security numbers, information to process insurance claims, prescription information such as prescription number, prescribing doctor, medication names and dates, medical history, as well as certain clinical services, such as whether a patient ordered a flu test. Certain information from business clients of Kroger Prescription Plans, Inc. and Kroger Personal Finance were also impacted.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Member,

Subject: Notice of Data Breach

Central California Alliance for Health (the Alliance) has been informed of a data security breach that may have involved unintentional disclosure of our members' health information. Alliance employees' email accounts were accessed, but there is no proof to suggest that any member health information is being misused at this time. The Alliance wants to ensure that members who may have been affected are notified that their health information may have been disclosed.

After we finished our initial investigation and notified impacted members about what happened, we continued to review the case. During that review, we found more impacted people, including you.

What Happened:

On May 7, 2020, the Alliance found that many Alliance employees' email accounts were accessed illegally by an unknown person. These accounts were accessed for about one hour. The Alliance found the issue and immediately shut down the Alliance employees' email accounts that were accessed.

What Information Was Involved:

After a thorough review, the Alliance found that only limited member health information may have been accessed. Although we don't know exactly which email messages were opened, the member health information that may have been accessed includes:

- Alliance Care Management program records
- Claims information
- Date of birth
- Demographic information
- Medi-Cal ID number
- Medical information
- Referral information

The Alliance employees' email accounts would not have included financial information and social security numbers.

What We Are Doing:

The Alliance has taken steps to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. The Alliance took immediate efforts to shut down the Alliance employees' email accounts that were involved to make sure the unknown person could not access any more member health information. All Alliance employees, even those not involved in the data security breach, were asked to change their email password information to ensure all email accounts were secured. Also, all Alliance employees were required to take training on preventing these types of data security breaches.

What You Can Do:

We suggest that you keep a copy of this notice for your records in case there are any concerns with your medical records in the future. No further action is required of you. You have the right to review your Alliance billing information at no charge to ensure that your Alliance ID number has not been misused. To review your Alliance billing information, you can request a copy of your records by submitting a Records Access Request Form to the Alliance.

If you would like to request a copy of the Records Access Request Form to be mailed to you, or would like to request a pre-paid envelope, please call the Alliance Member Services Department at 800-700-3874, Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. You can also access a copy of the Records Access Request Form on the Alliance member website at https://www.ccah-alliance.org/forms-resources.html under the section title, Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: On March 11, 2021, Pan-American Life Insurance Group released a statement regarding a data security incident that occurred on February 19, 2021. The company detected suspicious activity within their computer systems and immediately took their computer network offline to protect policyholder information, other data, and their systems. Third-party cyber experts were engaged to investigate the incident and prevent similar incidents in the future. The investigation confirmed that personal information was accessed without authorization due to a phishing attempt that resulted in malware being installed on the computer network. Policyholder and beneficiary information such as name, address, and date of birth were taken, and a small percentage of policyholders and beneficiaries may have had more sensitive information taken. The company will be contacting those individuals directly by mail or email with more information. There is no evidence that any information was misused for fraudulent purposes as a result of this incident. Pan-American Life Insurance Group is taking steps to increase the security of their systems and is offering information on how to protect personal information. Individuals whose information was taken are being offered additional services. To protect oneself from possible identity theft, individuals are advised to order a free credit report, place a fraud alert on their credit file, and place a security freeze on their credit file. The company's privacy practices are detailed in the statement, and individuals have the right to access their information, request corrections to their data, and object to the use of their information.	The breach occurred due to a phishing attempt that resulted in malware being installed on the computer network. This indicates that an outside party hacked into the company's computer network.
Insufficient information	Insufficient information provided to determine type of breach.
Insufficient information	As there is no description provided on the nature of the breach, and the data source only indicates "nan", it is impossible to classify the type of breach with certainty, but it is likely to be unknown (UNKN).

Subject: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>:

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. The privacy and security of the personal information of the individuals we serve is extremely important to Golden Gate Regional Center (GGRC). That is why we are writing to inform you about this incident, offer complimentary identity monitoring and protection services, and provide you with information relating to steps that can be taken to help protect the information of individuals we serve.

What Happened?

On September 23, 2020, GGRC detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity's network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity's files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity's files. Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. On January 13, 2021, GGRC discovered your information may have been affected. While we have no evidence that any personal or protected health information belonging to the individuals we serve has been misused, out of an abundance of caution, we are informing you of the incident and providing you with access to complimentary identity monitoring and protection services from IDX.

What Information Was Involved?

The types of information impacted may include your first and/or last name, GGRC-issued unique client identifier number, service descriptions or codes, vendor or service provider names or numbers, and/or cost information related to the service.

What Are We Doing?

As soon as GGRC discovered the incident, we took the steps described above. We have also taken measures to further enhance the security of information in our possession and to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. In addition, we have notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about this incident, and we will work with and provide assistance to law enforcement to hold the perpetrators accountable.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant and review your account statements and credit reports closely.

You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC).

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

NOTICE OF A DATA BREACH

Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit) values and respects the privacy of our customers and employees and takes protecting the confidentiality of that information seriously. Unfortunately, we are writing to advise you of a security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. We learned that a limited number of AC Transit employees email accounts were accessed without authorization between April 7, 2020, and June 16, 2020. Those email accounts may have contained some of your personal information.

What Information Was Involved?

On or around January 4, 2021, our investigation determined that the involved email accounts contained your name and <<Breached Elements>>.

What We Are Doing.

Upon learning of the incident, we promptly took remediation efforts to prevent further access, including resetting the credentials of the compromised email accounts. We also retained a leading forensic security firm to investigate and conduct a comprehensive search for any personal information in the impacted email accounts, and to confirm the security of our email and computer systems. To help prevent a similar incident from happening in the future we are taking steps to enhance the security of our systems, including enhancing our data security protocols and staff training. While we are not aware of any fraud or identity theft related to the incident, we are notifying you of the incident to encourage you to diligently monitor your personal accounts.

What You Can Do.

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud. Some of these steps may include reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. As a further precautionary measure, we are also offering a complimentary one-year membership of IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on identity theft prevention and IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

Other Important Information.

You should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your states attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft. For more information, and to contact the FTC, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You may also contact the FTC at Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is also designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. To place a credit freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request to each of the three major consumer reporting agencies by regular, certified, or overnight mail at the addresses below or, if available, comply with the consumer reporting agencies online credit freeze request procedures:

We take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously, and we want to provide you with information about the incident, explain the services we are making available to you, and assure you that we are taking significant measures to protect your information.

What Happened?

On January 22, 2021, Flagstar Bank was informed by Accellion, a vendor that Flagstar uses for its file sharing platform, that the platform had a vulnerability that was exploited by an unauthorized party. Flagstar Bank immediately discontinued use of this file sharing platform. Unfortunately, we have learned that the unauthorized party was able to access some of Flagstar Bank's information on the Accellion platform, and we are one of numerous Accellion clients who were impacted. However, Flagstar Bank remains fully operational and other parts of our IT infrastructure outside of the Accellion platform were not impacted. Importantly, the Accellion platform was segmented from the rest of our network, and our core banking and mortgage systems were not affected.

What We Are Doing

Upon learning of the vulnerability, Flagstar Bank promptly took the Accellion server offline and permanently discontinued use of this file sharing platform. Additionally, we acted immediately to contain the threat and engaged a team of third-party forensic experts to investigate and determine the full scope of this incident. As part of our investigation, we have also notified law enforcement.

What Information Was Involved?

On March 6, 2021, we determined that one or more of the documents removed from the Accellion platform contained your <<b2b_text_1(DataElements)>>.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

Quality CPR Care LLC dba American CPR Care Association (ACCA) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have involved your personal information. This letter provides information about the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from potential misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On November 29, 2020, we were alerted to unusual activity related to certain customers' payment cards. We immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the activity. The investigation determined the existence of a webshell with the capability of accessing information stored in our environment. While the investigation could not confirm whether personal information was compromised as a result of this incident, this possibility could not be ruled out. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we undertook a comprehensive review of the information residing in our database to confirm the types of information within the database and the individuals to whom the information related. This review was completed on January 15, 2021, and we determined that certain of your personal information was stored within the impacted database.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that your first and last name, as well as your debit or credit card number, temporarily resided in the potentially impacted database. At the time of the incident, ACCA stored customer payment card information in our database for approximately 24 hours after a transaction for quality assurance purposes. However, as of December 16, 2020, we no longer temporarily store any payment card information.

What We Are Doing.

We take the security of personal information in our care seriously.

Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information

Monitor Your Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus listed below directly to request a free copy of your credit report. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

CPR AED Course LLC dba American Health Care Academy (AHCA) is writing to inform you of a recent incident involving your personal information. This letter provides information about the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from potential misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On November 29, 2020, we were alerted to unusual activity related to certain of our customers' payment cards. We immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the activity. The investigation determined the existence of a webshell with the capability of accessing information stored in our environment. While the investigation could not confirm whether personal information was compromised as a result of this incident, this possibility could not be ruled out. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we undertook a comprehensive review of the information residing in our database to confirm the types of information within the database and the individuals to whom the information related. This review was completed on January 15, 2021, and we determined that certain of your personal information was stored within the impacted account.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that your first and last name, as well as your debit or credit card number, temporarily resided in the potentially impacted database. At the time of the incident, AHCA stored customer payment card information in our database for approximately 24 hours after a transaction for quality assurance purposes. However, as of December 16, 2020, we no longer temporarily store any payment card information.

What We Are Doing.

We take the security of personal information in our care seriously. Upon learning of this incident, we moved quickly to assess the security of our database and systems, reset relevant passwords, and to notify potentially impacted individuals. As part of our ongoing commitment to information security, we have already enhanced existing policies and procedures, including changes to our payment card collection process where we no longer store any payment card information. Additionally, we are notifying potentially impacted individuals, including you, so that you may take further steps to protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

I am writing to inform you of an incident involving your personal information.

What Happened

On December 24-29, 2020, a file transfer service used by Kroger to transfer large data files associated with its money transfer operations, among other services, was compromised. The file transfer service was provided by Kroger's vendor, Accellion. The compromise resulted in an unauthorized party stealing significant volumes of data and records from a large number of Accellion customers, including Kroger. According to Kroger, it learned of this unauthorized access on January 23, 2021. Kroger informed us that the unauthorized access likely occurred between December 24, 2020, and December 29, 2020. Kroger has assured us that it no longer uses the impacted service.

Kroger had been using Accellion to transmit operational reports related to Western Union money transfers that were initiated or paid out in person at Kroger retail locations, as well as retail locations of additional Kroger-owned retail brands. These Kroger-owned brands include Kroger, Dillons, Ralphs, King Scoopers, City Market, Smith's, Fred Meyer, Frys, QFC, Roundys, Marianos, and Harris Teeter.

Upon receiving the necessary data from Kroger, we immediately began investigating to determine what personal information handled by Kroger was affected and which of our valued customers were impacted due to the compromise of Kroger's service provider. Our investigation determined that some of the affected reports included information about you.

I want to emphasize that Western Union's information systems were not affected by this incident, and we have no evidence that any money transfers were impacted.

What We Are Doing

We take this matter very seriously and are fully committed to protecting the privacy and security of our customers' information. As noted above, after learning of this incident, we immediately initiated an investigation. We have confirmed that Kroger stopped using the affected file transfer service provided by Accellion. Although our systems were not impacted, we will be reviewing Kroger's security practices and monitoring the circumstances surrounding this event.

To help protect your identity, we are offering complimentary access to Experian Identity WorksSM for a period of two years.

If you believe there was fraudulent use of your information as a result of this incident and would like to discuss how you may be able to resolve those issues, please reach out to an Experian agent.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear Jefit user,

We are writing to inform you of a cyber-incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. Please note that no financial data was involved in this breach. We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously and want to explain what happened and the steps you can take to protect yourself against cybercrime.

In early last month, we became aware of this data breach from a few users' reports and immediately investigated. Soon after, we took a series of actions to ensure our system is safe and to further protect your account. Upon discovering this breach, we took immediate action to secure our servers and the impacted accounts. We also began an investigation to understand the scope of the incident. We were able to identify the root cause of the data incident and confirmed that other Jefit systems were unaffected. We also contacted law enforcement.

At this time, there is no sensitive financial data involved since we never stored customers' payment information. All payment processes were directly handled by Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or directly processed by the payment gateway company if customers purchased products on our website. Nevertheless, we are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution because some other part of your private information was accessed by the perpetrator of the cyber-incident.

The personal and private information that the perpetrator gained access to includes some or possibly all of the following: Jefit account username, email address (associated with the account), encrypted password (hashed with unique salt to each account), and IP address when creating the account.

Upon discovery of the cyber-attack, we immediately secured and patched the bug. We also conducted a forensic investigation to confirm that no other systems were impacted. We have taken security measures to strengthen our network against similar incidents in the future. We have also implemented a stronger password policy on our product to further protect users' accounts in the future.

We want to make sure you are aware of steps you may take to guard against potential phishing email attacks or other forms of fraud. Although all the passwords have been hashed with unique salt (meaning passwords were encrypted) before saving to our system, it is still possible for the perpetrator to decrypt some of them if the passwords were too simple. We encourage you to change your password as soon as you can.

We take the privacy and security of your information seriously and sincerely regret any concerns or inconvenience that the incident may have caused you.

Sincerely,

Ying Lin
CEO	The breach involved an outside party hacking into the system and gaining access to users' personal and private information.

Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear Insulet Customer,

We are writing to inform you that a recent data security incident involving a vendor of Insulet Corporation (Insulet) may have potentially affected some of your protected health information (PHI). The incident was disclosed to us by the vendor, Cornerstone On-Demand (Cornerstone), and we have completed an extensive review and investigation to identify potentially affected individuals.

On or about January 19, 2021, Cornerstone notified us that a third party gained unauthorized access to certain systems on January 13, 2021. Cornerstone determined that customer first and last names, email addresses, Insulet customer training records, and online course information may have been accessed, and some of that data may have been downloaded by an unauthorized third party.

Cornerstone did not collect any other PHI on our behalf, so no other Insulet customer information about you was exposed by the Cornerstone breach. We take this event very seriously and have implemented additional security measures to reduce the likelihood of another attack.

If you have any further questions or concerns about this incident, please contact us at our toll-free number 866-915-0009 or by email at privacy@insulet.com.

Thank you for your continued support.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [Recipient],

We at SunMed Group Holdings, LLC (SunMed) value the privacy and security of your personal information. Unfortunately, we are writing to inform you of a security incident that has occurred. We want to provide you with information about the incident, explain the services we are making available to you, and assure you that we are taking significant measures to protect your information.

What Happened?
On Sunday, October 11, 2020, a ransomware infection encrypted files stored on some of our servers. As a result, a hacker was able to gain access to our computer system (likely through one of our employees clicking on an external link in an email that was not cleared through our email scanning tool) and lock it up from functioning. Fortunately, our IT team discovered the situation and was able to restore the system so that we could resume operations on Monday morning. We have not received any further communication from the hacker and have not had any reports that anyone's personal information from our system has been used or sold by the hacker.

What We Are Doing
Upon learning of the issue, we contained the threat and immediately commenced a thorough investigation. As part of our investigation, we have been working very closely with external cybersecurity professionals experienced in handling these types of incidents, as well as law enforcement. We continue to fortify our security measures to help prevent future cybersecurity threats.

What Information Was Involved?
On February 21, 2021, following an extensive review and analysis of the data at issue, we determined that the information acquired by the threat actor may have contained some of your personal information, including your [insert specific information if available].

Nevertheless, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership in myTrueIdentity provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion. For more information on identity theft prevention and myTrueIdentity, including instructions on how to activate your one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

This letter also provides other precautionary measures you can take to protect your personal information, including placing a fraud alert and/or security freeze on your credit files, and/or obtaining a free credit report. Additionally, you should always remain vigilant in reviewing your financial account statements and credit reports for fraudulent or irregular activity on a regular basis.

For More Information
We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused. We are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information in our possession and have taken many precautions to safeguard it.

Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score. Once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain one year of unlimited access to your TransUnion credit report and credit score. The daily credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit file at TransUnion, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address and more.

When prompted, enter the following 6-digit telephone pass code [insert code] to speak to a TransUnion representative about your identity theft issue.

2. Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File
Whether or not you choose to use the complimentary 12-month credit monitoring services, we recommend that you place an initial one-year Fraud Alert on your credit files, at no charge. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you personally before they open any new accounts. To place a fraud alert, call any one of the three major credit bureaus at the numbers listed below. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, they will notify the others.

3. Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File
If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a Security Freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:

Equifax Security Freeze
P.O. Box 105788
Atlanta, GA 30348

TransUnion Security Freeze
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19016
http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze
1-888-909-8872

In order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze. If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the City in which you currently reside. If you do place a security freeze prior to enrolling in the credit monitoring service as described above, you will need to remove the freeze in order to sign up for the credit monitoring service. After you sign up for the credit monitoring service, you may refreeze your credit file.

4. Obtaining a Free Credit Report
Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

5. Additional Helpful Resources

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission.

To file a complaint with the FTC, go to www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338). Complaints filed with the FTC will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, which is a database made available to law enforcement agencies.

Copy of Credit Report

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf. Or you can elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies. Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries is provided below:

Fraud Alert

You may consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze

You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. There shall be no charge for a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information:

Re: Notice of Data Breach Involving Your Personal Data

Dear [Insert Name],

At Hagerty Insurance Agency, LLC (Hagerty) we take data privacy very seriously. It is therefore important that we make you aware of any data privacy issues that may affect you. Below you will find information about an incident with our insurance quote feature that may have released your personal information without your authorization. We are actively taking steps to protect your information as outlined below. Please note that you may be affected even if you have no relationship with Hagerty.

Hagerty is an insurance agency specializing in providing specialty insurance for collectable vehicles. Hagerty maintains a public-facing website that includes an Instant Quote feature which allows anyone to obtain a tailored insurance quote for their vehicle by entering in basic personal information and details on the vehicle they want to insure. After personal information is entered, our quote feature tracks down additional consumer data from an outside provider for verification and to improve the accuracy of the automated quote.

What Happened

On February 2, Hagerty's web team noticed an increase in insurance quote requests via our Instant Quote feature. The high level of quote activity was suspicious and initial investigations indicated that automated bots were submitting fake quotes. Hagerty immediately deployed mechanisms to detect, prevent, and block bot activity in our quote system. On February 16, Hagerty became aware that this incident was likely part of a widespread cyber-fraud scheme targeting quote systems across many different insurers and insurance agencies. Malicious bot activity is increasingly prevalent and can be used to tap into systems to harvest specific online consumer data. Based on information known about these widespread attacks, Hagerty was able to identify that the bot activity was intended to access individuals' personal information, including drivers license numbers, that was inadvertently embedded in the source code of the quote webpage after submitting a request for a quote, and was therefore accessible to the attackers. While this additional personal information was not visible on the webpage itself, the attacker could search the source code to find it.

What Information Was Involved

Our records indicate that your name, drivers license number, and date of birth may have been accessed in early February.

Actions We've Taken to Safeguard Your Information

We take our responsibility to safeguard your personal information as our utmost priority. We immediately deployed mechanisms to detect, prevent, and block bot activity in our quote feature and have implemented processes and protocols to mitigate this type of activity. As of March 2nd, the quote feature safeguards have successfully prevented any additional bot activity.

Steps You May Take to Protect Yourself Against Potential Misuse of Information

We recommend that you regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by mailing an Annual Credit Report Request Form (available at www.annualcreditreport.com) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA, 30348-5281. You may also obtain a copy of your credit report by contacting one or more of the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.

Equifax: P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, Georgia 30374-0241, 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com
Experian: P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013, 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
TransUnion: P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 19022, 1-800-888-4213, www.transunion.com

When you receive your credit reports, review them carefully. Look for accounts or creditor inquiries that you did not initiate or do not recognize. Look for information, such as home address and Social Security number, that is not accurate. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report.

We recommend you remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports. We also recommend that you promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You may contact the FTC or your state's regulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding identity theft.

Fraud Alerts:

There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for 7 years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling the toll-free fraud number of any of the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.

Equifax: 1-888-766-0008, www.equifax.com
Experian: 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289, fraud.transunion.com

Credit Freezes:

You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Placing, lifting, and/or removing a credit freeze from your account is completely free and will not affect your credit score. Please contact the three national credit reporting agencies as specified below to find out more information:

Equifax: P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com
Experian: P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion: P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA, 19022-2000, freeze.transunion.com

You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the three national credit reporting agencies listed above.

RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear [Owner Name],

We are writing to inform you about a recent information security incident that may have affected certain pieces of your personal information and to advise you of steps you may take to identify misuse of your personal information. This letter is on behalf of the California State Controllers Office (SCO) Unclaimed Property Division.

WHAT HAPPENED?

A SCO employee clicked on a link in an email that appeared to come from a trusted outside entity and unknowingly provided an unauthorized user with access to their email account. The unauthorized user had access to the account from March 18, 2021, at 1:42 p.m. to March 19, 2021, at 3:19 p.m. and sent potentially malicious emails to some of the SCO employees' contacts.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

SCO has reason to believe that the compromised email account had personal identifying information contained in Unclaimed Property Holder Reports. These reports are submitted by corporations with whom you have transacted business but, after a period of years, had lost contact with you and your property turned over. (Your property may be searched for at www.claimit.ca.gov.) That information potentially included your first and last name, address at the time your property was deemed lost by the corporation, social security number, birth date, and value of property turned over to SCO.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

The improperly accessed email account was discovered promptly and access removed. SCO Unclaimed Property Division personnel immediately began a review of all emails in the account for personal identifying information that may have been viewed. Contacts of the SCO employee were advised to delete suspicious emails and not click on any links therein.

To assist you in protecting yourself against identity theft, we have arranged to make available to you 24 months of identity theft resolution services provided by Experian IdentityWorks SM, at no charge. Details on how to enroll are enclosed. Please note that you must enroll to take advantage of this free service, and we encourage you to do so.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

As always, we recommend you be on the alert for suspicious activity related to your financial accounts and credit reports. We encourage you to regularly monitor your statements and records to ensure there are no transactions or other activities that you did not initiate or authorize.

FOR MORE INFORMATION

Please be assured that we are committed to helping you protect your credit and identity and ensuring that your information is safe and secure. We regret this incident and apologize for any concern it may have caused you. If you have further questions regarding this matter, please call (916) 322-3160 or email UCPReporting@sco.ca.gov.

Sincerely,

California State Controllers Office

ADDITIONAL ACTIONS TO HELP REDUCE YOUR CHANCES OF IDENTITY THEFT

PLACE A 90-DAY FRAUD ALERT ON YOUR CREDIT FILE

An initial 90-day security alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a victim of fraud. When you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit on an existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the lender should take steps to verify that you have authorized the request. If the creditor cannot verify this, the request should not be satisfied. You may contact one of the credit reporting companies below for assistance.

Equifax 1-800-525-6285 www.equifax.com
Experian 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com
TransUnion 1-800-680-7289 www.transunion.com

PLACE A SECURITY FREEZE ON YOUR CREDIT FILE

If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, a security freeze might be right for you. Placing a freeze on your credit report will prevent lenders and others from accessing your credit report entirely, which will prevent them from extending credit. With a Security Freeze in place, you will be required to take special steps when you wish to apply for any type of credit. This process is also completed through each of the credit reporting companies. The cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a security freeze varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company.

ORDER YOUR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORTS

Visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 877-322-8228. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

MANAGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Take steps such as carrying only essential documents with you, being aware of whom you are sharing your personal information with, and shredding receipts, statements, and other sensitive information.

USE TOOLS FROM CREDIT PROVIDERS

Carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card, and other account statements. Be proactive and create alerts on credit cards and bank accounts to notify you of activity. If you discover unauthorized or suspicious activity on your credit report or by any other means, file an identity theft report with your local police and contact a credit reporting company.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent PACE Nebraska and PACE Iowa, doing business each, individually, as Immanuel Pathways (Pathways), located at 1044 North 115th Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68154, and are writing to notify your Office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to five hundred and seventy-eight (578) Iowa residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Pathways does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

Pathways serves as a provider of the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) to Iowa residents. PeakTPA provides third-party pharmacy administration services to Pathways program participants. On January 23, 2021, Pathways received notice from PeakTPA of a ransomware incident. PeakTPA reported that on December 31, 2020, it experienced a ransomware event that resulted in the encryption of certain PeakTPA systems. PeakTPA reported that law enforcement was notified and that PeakTPA worked with forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incident. Following its investigation, PeakTPA notified its customers that an unknown actor may have accessed or acquired certain PeakTPA customer data. PeakTPA reported that the data was accessed or exfiltrated by the threat actor at some point on or about December 29 and December 31, 2020.

Upon being notified by PeakTPA of the incident, Pathways immediately commenced an investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive Pathways participant information was potentially impacted. This investigation involved a review of the information provided by PeakTPA on January 27, 2021, to understand the scope of the incident. As a result of this incident, Pathways investigation determined that the information potentially affected may have contained information including program names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, Medicare identification numbers, and/or prescription information was involved.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On or about March 23, 2021, Pathways began providing written notice of this incident to affected individuals, which includes five hundred and seventy-eight (578) Iowa residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A. Pathways also posted notice of this incident on its website and provided notice to prominent media outlets in Iowa. A copy of the website notice is attached here as Exhibit B. A copy of the media notice is attached here as Exhibit C.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, Pathways moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of internal Pathways systems, and identify potentially affected individuals in order to provide them with notice. Pathways is also working to review existing policies and procedures regarding its third-party vendors and working to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future.

As an added precaution, Pathways is also providing complimentary access to three years of credit and identity monitoring services through Kroll, to individuals whose information was potentially affected by this incident, at no cost to these individuals. Additionally, Pathways is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing their Explanation of Benefits, account statements, and credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Steps You Can Take to Prevent Identity Theft and Fraud:

Monitor Your Accounts
Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Should you wish to place a fraud alert or credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

Dear Sir or Madam:

By providing this notice, NWF does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On or about December 4, 2020, NWF received notice from its third-party IT website security vendor of a potential data security incident that may have resulted in the compromise of payment cards used at Zoobooks.com. Upon receiving this notice, NWF immediately began an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this potential incident. NWF also worked to determine what happened, what information was involved, and how to secure Zoobooks.com. Through the investigation, NWF determined on January 8, 2021, that malicious code could have facilitated the unauthorized acquisition of customers' payment card information entered on Zoobooks.com between February 6, 2019, and December 10, 2020. NWF worked with its third-party vendors to immediately remediate this issue. NWF also worked to identify those who may have provided payment card information during the window identified and locate their address information.

Upon completion of these activities, NWF moved to notify those whose payment card information may be impacted. The information potentially affected included customer order and payment information, such as name, address, payment card number, expiration date, and CVV number.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On or about March 24, 2021, NWF provided written notice of this incident to affected individuals, which includes approximately one thousand seventy-six (1,076) Iowa residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

NWF treats its responsibility to safeguard personal information as an utmost priority. As such, NWF responded immediately to this incident upon receiving notice, and it has been working diligently to identify individuals and provide them with an accurate and complete notice of the incident. As part of its ongoing commitment to the privacy and security of personal information in its care, NWF worked with its third-party vendors to implement additional security measures to further protect the privacy and security of the information in its care. NWF is also evaluating additional security measures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

Additionally, NWF is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. NWF is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, information the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

We take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously and we sincerely regret any concern this incident may cause you.

Why Does Accellion Have My Personal Information?

CHW used Accellion to exchange data files with healthcare providers and other vendors that support our operations.

What Happened?

On January 25, 2021, Accellion informed us that its file transfer platform was compromised by an unknown malicious party. The compromise allowed the malicious party to view or download our data files stored on Accellion's system from January 7 to January 25, 2021. Our investigation determined that your personal information was included in the data files involved in this incident. At this point, we are not aware of any fraud or misuse of your personal information due to this incident, but we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution.

What Information Was Involved?

The personal information involved in this incident may have included your name and one or more of the following types of information:

We have taken the following actions in response to this incident:

- Accellion is coordinating its incident response with law enforcement authorities, including the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
- We stopped using Accellion's services and removed all of our data files from its system.
- We reviewed our other file transfer service processes and tools to ensure they are not at risk to a similar attack.

We at Rosa Mexicano understand the importance of safeguarding the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you may consider taking.

What Happened?

Rosa Mexicano recently concluded an investigation of an incident that involved unauthorized access to employees' email accounts. Upon first suspecting unauthorized access, we immediately secured the accounts and launched an investigation with assistance from a computer forensics firm. In connection with that investigation, we learned that an unauthorized party gained access to the employees' email accounts at various times between October 6, 2020, and November 4, 2020. Our investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized party actually viewed any emails or attachments in the accounts.

What Information Was Involved?

In an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments contained in the email accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized party. On February 19, 2021, we determined that the accounts included an email and/or attachment containing your <<b2b_text_1(ImpactedData)>>

What We Are Doing.

We regret any concern this incident may cause you. To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we are implementing additional policies and security features to enhance our security posture and increasing employee cybersecurity training.

What You Can Do.

To date, we are unaware of any misuse of any of the information in the employees' email accounts, nor do we have any evidence that any emails or attachments containing your information were actually viewed. However, we wanted to inform you of this event, assure you that we take this very seriously, and provide you with ways to protect your information.

As a precaution, we have secured the services of Experian to offer you a complimentary two-year membership in Experian's IdentityWorksSM.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

Santa Catalina School is writing to notify you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud). This notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. Blackbaud notified us and many other institutions on July 16, 2020, that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that there had been unauthorized access to its systems between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020, that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement. Initially, Blackbaud informed us that the fields in the database backups containing personal information were encrypted and not accessible by the unauthorized individual. However, further investigation determined that this was not the case, and Blackbaud informed us of their updated findings on September 29, 2020. Following receipt of the notifications about the incident from Blackbaud, we launched our investigation and worked with Blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved. On February 23, 2021, we determined that the unencrypted Blackbaud backup file contained some of your information.

What Information Was Involved?

The Blackbaud backup file involved contained your <<b2b_text_1(ImpactedData)>>. Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual, and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What You Can Do:

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. As a precaution, Blackbaud is offering you a complimentary membership to Kroll's Identity Monitoring and Fraud Resolution services for 12 months.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear <<Name 1>>,

We are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have involved your personal information maintained by La Clinica de la Raza (La Clinica). On January 28, 2021, La Clinica became aware that malware had been deployed on certain La Clinica systems which store information, including personal information, for the organization. Upon learning of the incident, La Clinica immediately took steps to stop access to these systems, including permanently disconnecting the affected systems from other La Clinica systems and its overall network. La Clinica also began an immediate investigation of the incident with the support of a third-party forensics company. On February 26, 2021, La Clinica's investigation determined that the malware was deployed by an unauthorized individual or entity who gained unauthorized access to La Clinica's systems. Upon learning of the unauthorized access, La Clinica immediately took additional mitigation steps and security measures, including deploying additional measures to monitor the organization's systems and technology infrastructure.

La Clinica's ongoing investigation has determined that unauthorized access to the affected systems occurred, and ended, on January 12, 2021. Based on the investigation to date, we reasonably believe that relatively few documents were likely viewed by the unauthorized party. However, our investigation could not definitively conclude that the unauthorized party did not access, use or disclose certain information and documents stored in the affected La Clinica systems, which may have included some of the following information: your full name, date of birth, phone number, home address, health insurance information, and certain health information such as dates of service, diagnosis, test results, and treatment information related to care received at La Clinica. Social security numbers and financial account information were not stored in the affected systems and therefore were not involved in this incident. Further, based on our investigation and security practices, we have no reason to believe that there has been any improper access to La Clinica's electronic medical record or billing systems.

La Clinica has taken, and will continue to take, steps to prevent this type of incident from happening again, including enhancing our data security, implementing additional technology safeguards including enhanced intrusion detection and prevention, securing login credentials, enhanced workforce training, and other cybersecurity risk prevention measures. We have also reviewed our security policies and procedures to ensure that they sufficiently protect against further incidents of this type. In addition, we notified federal law enforcement authorities about the incident and will continue to cooperate with their investigation.

Please review the enclosed Information About Identity Theft Protection section included with this letter. This section describes steps you can take to help protect your identity, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identify theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file if you wish to do so.

We sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern caused by this incident. We take our responsibility to protect the personal information of our patients very seriously. If you have questions or concerns about this incident, please call 855-654-0864, Monday through Friday, between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

Sincerely,

Fernando Cortez
Chief Information Officer & Information Security Officer	Malware was deployed by an unauthorized individual or entity who gained unauthorized access to La Clinica's systems.

We are writing to notify you of a security incident affecting the security of your Manhunt account credentials.

What Happened?

On March 2, 2021, Manhunt discovered that an attacker gained access to a database that stored account credentials for Manhunt users. The attacker downloaded the usernames, email addresses and passwords for a subset of our users. We immediately took steps to remediate the threat and reset the passwords of affected users.

What Information Was Involved?

The data elements accessed by the unauthorized attacker included your Manhunt username, password, and email address used to register your account. We have no evidence that users pictures, messages, or other profile information were acquired by the attacker. As we do not transmit or store any payment card information, no payment card information was exposed as a result of this incident.

What We Are Doing

Manhunt takes your privacy and security seriously. When we discovered this incident, we immediately took steps to contain the intrusion and remediate the threat that led to the unauthorized access. We also reset the passwords for affected user accounts and retained a third-party forensics consultant to assist us in investigating what happened and confirm that there is no ongoing unauthorized access to our systems.

What You Can Do

We have reset your account password. So, if you haven't done so already, you will be prompted to create a new password the next time you log in. We strongly encourage you to select a unique password that you have not used for another website or account. If you used your previous Manhunt account password on other sites, we urge you to change those passwords as well. Additionally, be vigilant for phishing messages purporting to be from Manhunt or claiming to have information about your Manhunt account. Manhunt will never ask you for your password or other sensitive information via email. You should also never click on links in emails from senders you do not know. If you notice any unusual activity on your Manhunt account or if you receive any unusual communication purporting to be from Manhunt, please contact us using the contact information below.

For More Information

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident may have caused. If you have any questions regarding this incident, please contact Manhunt at support@manhunt.net. While we have no reason to think that this incident exposed any information that could be used to commit identity theft, certain state laws require us to provide you with information about preventing and reporting identity theft.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of payment card fraud or misuse, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. If you see any unauthorized or suspicious activity, promptly contact your bank, credit union, or credit card company.

Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

Place a Security Freeze

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

P.O. Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013

In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.);
7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

Place a Fraud Alert

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:

Although there is no indication that your information has been misused in relation to this incident, we are providing you with information about the incident, our response to it, and information related to what you may do to better protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On May 27, 2020, Crestline became aware of suspicious activity relating to its systems and immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the activity. An unauthorized actor gained access to Crestline's system between May 25, 2020, and May 27, 2020, encrypted certain files, and removed certain files from our network. The unauthorized actor threatened to release and did release an unknown number of files acquired from the Crestline network.

Although the investigation was unable to confirm which specific files were impacted, we could not rule out the possibility that some of your information may have been accessed. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, Crestline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. This review was recently completed and determined that your information was present in potentially impacted files. At this time, we are unaware of any actual fraudulent misuse of your information or whether files containing your information were actually accessed or acquired by the unknown actor.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that at the time of the incident your name and <<data elements>> were stored within potentially impacted files.

What We Are Doing.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

We, at Active Lifestyle Products & Services, Inc., d/b/a as ALP S Brands (ALPS), value and respect the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that has occurred.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On February 25, 2021, ALPS discovered a potential security concern with its website(s) (including, www.alpsbrands.com, www.alpsmountaineering.com, www.alpsoutdoorz.com, www.browningcamping.com, www.hikerdirect.com, and www.alpscedarridge.com, collectively referred to herein as the Websites). ALPS moved swiftly to engage a service provider to investigate the issue. The next day, February 26, 2021, the service provider that ALPS engaged to investigate the Websites confirmed that ALPS systems had been unlawfully accessed by an unknown third party. The affected systems were immediately disabled while ALPS and its service provider conducted an investigation of the issue to determine if any customer information had been compromised. Our technology systems have since been secured and restored to working order.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

An unknown attacker unlawfully breached the e-commerce portion of the Websites and installed a malicious program that attempts to capture data related to certain credit card transactions. This malicious program only works on live transactions as they take place. ALPS does not keep or store your credit card information. Our investigation indicated that this software was installed as far back as April 20, 2020. The transaction data captured by the attack included the following personal information: the customers' first and last names, email address, mailing address, and credit card information, including the credit card number, the expiration date, and the CVV code for such card. Please be rest assured that ALPS does not collect through the e-commerce portion of the Websites any social security numbers or protected health information, and so this information was not collected in the attack.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

ALPS values your privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. We are conducting a thorough review of the incident, and will notify you if there are any significant developments. We engaged a service provider to review and secure the system, and we are implementing additional security measures designed to prevent a recurrence of such an attack and to protect the privacy of our valued customers. We are working with the applicable governmental officials to ensure the incident is properly reported and addressed. This notice was not delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

You are receiving this letter because the patient listed above receives service from a hospital or health care provider that is a current or former member of Trinity Health*. The purpose of this letter is to notify you of an incident that may impact the privacy of certain confidential information related to the patient.

Trinity Health was recently notified by Accellion, a third-party vendor, of a security incident. The Accellion File Transfer Appliance is used by Trinity Health and many other companies for large file transfer service. Trinity Health provides information technology services for its current and some former member hospitals and health care providers, including file transfer and email services (* please see included information about Trinity Health and the affected locations).

This letter provides you with information about the event, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is necessary to do so. While we are unaware of misuse of information, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud. We have established a call center to answer your questions: (855) 935-6070.

What Happened?

On January 29, 2021, Accellion informed Trinity Health of a security issue with its secure file transfer platform, used for sending secure email. Upon receiving this notice, Trinity Health immediately took the appliance offline and launched an investigation into the issue and its impact on both Trinity Health and our patients and colleagues. This investigation determined that certain files present on the appliance on January 20 were downloaded by an unknown user. The unauthorized user was able to take advantage of a previously unknown and unreported flaw in the security of the Accellion appliance.

What Information is Involved?

Although the investigation is ongoing, on February 4, 2021, we determined file(s) were present on the appliance at the time of this event. The files contained certain protected health information, including some combination of the following: patient's name, address, email, date of birth, healthcare provider, dates and types of health care services, medical record number, immunization type, lab results, medications, payment, payer name, and claims information. <<b2b_text_1 (variable text sentence- SSN#, credit card information)>>

What We Are Doing.

We take these matters extremely seriously. When we were alerted of the security issue, we immediately took steps to terminate access and use of the appliance and worked with Accellion to investigate the event. We also confirmed the security of our network. Additionally, while we go to great lengths to protect patient and colleague information entrusted to us, as part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information in our care, we are further evaluating our data security policies and procedures.

What You Can Do.

We are providing notice of this event to you, so that you may take further steps to protect the patient's protected health information should you feel it is appropriate to do so. We encourage you to review the information in the attached Steps You Can Take to Protect Information.

Notice of Data Breach

What Happened?
On March 15, 2021, during the investigation into this incident, DSH discovered that the same employee had improperly accessed personal information, including addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, date of birth, and health information related to employment, of approximately 1735 employees and former employees, and 1217 DSH job applicants who never became DSH employees. This was discovered during the investigation of the same employee who was found to have improperly accessed approximately 1,415 patient and former patient, and 617 employee names, COVID-19 test results, and health information necessary for tracking COVID-19 on February 25, 2021. At this time, DSH has no evidence that there has been any use or attempted use of the information compromised by this incident. DSH is providing this notice so that those individuals potentially affected may be aware of what happened and can take steps to monitor any unusual activity regarding their personal information.

What information was involved?
(The following four paragraphs set out the four versions of the Notice of Data Breach provided to the four groups of impacted individuals.)

The confidential information contained:

If it is determined that more information was accessed than what was provided in this Notice of Data Breach letter, another notification will be provided to the affected individuals within 15 business days of the discovery that more information was accessed.

What we are doing:
DSH is investigating the breach and has placed the principal subject of the investigation on administrative leave pending completion of the investigation, continues to analyze the electronic network to see whether the employee improperly accessed any other information, and is cooperating with the law enforcement agency in conducting an investigation.

DSH has identified, and is notifying, all individuals whose Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) have been compromised, which is why you are receiving this letter. In addition, DSH has provided this update regarding this breach to the United States Health and Human Services, Office of Civil Rights, the California Office of Information Security, the California Office of Health Information Integrity, the California Highway Patrol, the California Department of Public Health, and the California Attorney General's Office.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that creditors contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. To place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, address history, state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take to prevent identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including the FTC or state Attorney General.

Personal Information of a Minor:

You can request that each of the three national credit reporting agencies perform a manual search for a minor's Social Security number to determine if there is an associated credit report. Copies of identifying information for the minor and parent/guardian may be required, including birth or adoption certificate, Social Security card, and government-issued identification card. If a credit report exists, you should request a copy of the report and immediately report any fraudulent accounts to the credit reporting agency. You can also report any misuse of minor's information to the FTC at https://www.identitytheft.gov/.

Blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to organizations, including Marines Memorial. Upon receiving notice of the cyber incident, we immediately commenced an investigation to better understand the nature and scope of the incident and any impact it had on the data of our members, donors, and guests. This notice provides information about the Blackbaud incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

Blackbaud reported that in May 2020, it experienced a ransomware incident that resulted in encryption of certain Blackbaud systems. Blackbaud notified law enforcement and worked with forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incident. After the completion of its investigation, Blackbaud informed its customers, including Marines Memorial, that an unknown actor may have accessed or acquired certain Blackbaud customer data. Blackbaud reported that the data was exfiltrated at some point before Blackbaud locked the threat actor out of the environment on May 20, 2020. Upon receiving the notification of the Blackbaud incident on July 16, 2020, Marines Memorial immediately commenced our investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive Marines Memorial data was potentially involved. This investigation included working with forensic investigators to gather further information from Blackbaud to understand the scope of the incident. Marines Memorial obtained a list of potentially impacted individuals on January 27, 2021.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that the information included in the involved Blackbaud systems contained your: <<b2b_text_1(DataElements)>>. Please note that, to date, we have not received confirmation from Blackbaud that your specific information was viewed by an unauthorized individual.

What We Are Doing

This incident occurred through our third-party vendor, Blackbaud, and affected all of their corporate clients, including Marines Memorial. This was not a compromise of Marines Memorial's internal systems. However, as part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information in our care, we are diligently reviewing our existing policies and procedures regarding programs and services provided by our third-party vendors. Specifically, we are working with Blackbaud to confirm they have implemented additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future. Due to the type of information which may have been accessed, we will also be notifying state regulators, as required.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of members, donors, and guests' information in our care are among our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. To alleviate any concerns that you may have, Marines Memorial is offering you access to 1 year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services through Experian at no cost to you.

2. Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File
If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a Security Freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:

Equifax Security Freeze
PO Box 105788
Atlanta, GA 30348
https://www.freeze.equifax.com
1-800-349-9960

After receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the City in which you currently reside.

3. Obtaining a Free Credit Report
Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

4. Additional Helpful Resources
Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many creditors will want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint with the FTC by contacting them on the web at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338), or by mail at Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear [First Name] [Last Name],

On behalf of Atlantic Media, Inc., I am writing to inform you about a recent incident that may have involved personal information about you. We regret that this incident occurred and take the security of personal information seriously.

WHAT HAPPENED.

We recently discovered that unauthorized actors gained access to our network, which resulted in issues with certain of our internal servers and systems. As soon as we became aware of it, we launched an in-depth investigation into this activity and took measures to restrict any further unauthorized access and restore the security and functionality of affected systems. We currently believe that the unauthorized actors had access to our network file share server from February 25, 2021 to March 1, 2021.

On March 16, 2021, we determined that W-2 and W-9 forms and other tax documents which include names and Social Security Numbers of certain current and former U.S. employees and independent contractors of Atlantic Media, Inc. and its current and former subsidiaries and affiliates, including The Atlantic Monthly Group LLC, Government Executive Media Group LLC, National Journal Group LLC, and Quartz Media LLC (collectively, Atlantic Media) were impacted.

Out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to provide notice to all U.S. current and former employees employed by Atlantic Media between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2020, as well as certain independent contractors, to alert them of this incident and provide them with an opportunity to enroll in complimentary credit monitoring and identity restoration services.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED.

We believe that the internal corporate files impacted may have included personal information about current or former employees or independent contractors such as: full names and Social Security or other tax identification numbers.

WHAT WE ARE DOING.

We are working with leading cybersecurity firms to assist our internal team with its investigation. Upon learning of the incident, we took immediate measures that we believe terminated the unauthorized actors' access as well as mitigated the risk of further attacks on our systems. These measures included temporarily disabling certain systems, limiting system access, and deploying additional security software on our systems. We also informed law enforcement. We are taking this incident very seriously and continue to work with cybersecurity experts to identify any additional opportunities for enhancing our overall security.

WHAT YOU CAN DO.

While we do not have reason to believe that any personal information has been misused, we are providing you with the following information about general steps that you can take to protect against potential misuse of personal information. Additionally, and as a precaution, we have arranged for you, at your option, to enroll in a complimentary two-year credit monitoring service provided by IDX, which includes credit monitoring, dark web monitoring, identity restoration services, and up to $1 million of identity theft insurance.

You have until July 7, 2021, to activate this complimentary service by using C/O IDX P.O. Box 1907 Suwanee, GA 30024 the following enrollment code: [**].

You should always remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by, for example, regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions. In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or law enforcement, including your state's Attorney General, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC's website, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338), or write to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228.

You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file.

You will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your request, each credit reporting agency will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN or password that you will need in order to lift or remove the freeze. You should keep the PIN or password in a safe place.

Dear [Name],

The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) is writing to inform you of an event that may have affected some of your information. ACEP provides professional organization services to its own members and also provides management services to other similar professional organizations in the industry, including the Emergency Medicine Foundation (EMF), the Emergency Medicine Residents Association (EMRA), and the Society for Emergency Medicine Physician Assistants (SEMPA). You are receiving this notice because you are (or were) a member of, made a purchase from, or donated to one or more of these entities.

While ACEP has no indication that your information has been misused, ACEP takes this event very seriously and is sharing details about the event, our response, and steps you can take to better protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On September 7, 2020, ACEP discovered unusual activity on its systems. Upon discovery, we commenced an investigation to determine the full scope of the activity. During the course of the investigation, it was determined that credentials to ACEP's separate SQL database servers were stored on a server that was compromised by an unauthorized actor. While there is no evidence the SQL servers were subject to unauthorized access or acquisition, because it cannot be ruled out, ACEP notified its partners in an abundance of caution and is providing this notice to you. The information was at risk between the dates of April 8, 2020, and September 21, 2020.

What Information Was Involved?

A review of our SQL database servers indicated that your name, [Notice Data Elements] were stored on an ACEP SQL server at the time of the incident. Again, we have not determined that your information was viewed or taken but are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution because the information was accessible during the time of the incident.

What ACEP is Doing?

ACEP takes the security of member and customer information seriously. Upon notice of the potential for unauthorized activity, we commenced an investigation, rebuilt the impacted server, changed passwords, and implemented additional technical safeguards. ACEP has also secured the services of Epiq to provide you with credit monitoring and identity restoration services for twelve (12) months, at no cost to you. More information on how to take advantage of these services can be found in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information.

What You Can Do?

We encourage you to remain vigilant for instances of fraud or misuse of your information from any source and to review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information for the resources you can take advantage of to better protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so. If your impacted information includes an email or online username, password, and/or security question and answer, you should promptly change your password/security question and answer, as well as any password/security question and answer that is the same or similar for other accounts.

We are writing to inform you that Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. recently discovered unauthorized computer code on its ecommerce website (www.hamiltonbeach.com) on February 4, 2021. We immediately removed the unauthorized code and began an investigation. A cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with our investigation. The code was capable of obtaining information entered by customers during the checkout process and sending that information out of our system. On March 12, 2021, the investigation determined that an unauthorized person could have accessed information entered by some customers during the checkout process for orders attempted or placed between December 18, 2020, and February 4, 2021.

The information that could have been copied includes contact information such as first and last name, shipping and billing address, email address, and phone number. Payment card information such as payment card number, expiration date, and card verification code for the payment card ending in <<Variable Data>> could also have been accessed.

Hamilton Beach has notified law enforcement and is cooperating with their investigation. We have also notified the payment card networks so that they can inform the banks that issued the cards. We worked to ensure the unauthorized person was no longer able to collect customer information and are taking measures to enhance the security of our site.

We encourage you to closely review your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. You should immediately report unauthorized charges to the bank that issued your card because payment card network rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely reported.

If you have any further questions or concerns, we established a dedicated call center, which can be reached by calling 855-654-0889 Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and regret that this occurred.

Sincerely,

Chuck Vion
Senior Manager, Digital Marketing

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE:

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

We urge you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports. Request that all three credit reports be sent to you, free of charge, for your review. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Thieves may hold stolen information to use at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, file a police report. Get a copy of the police report; you may need it to clear up the fraudulent debts.

If your personal information has been misused, visit the FTC's site at IdentityTheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations. You may also contact the FTC at 1-877-438-4338 or 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may also want to consider contacting the major credit bureaus at the telephone numbers above to place a credit freeze on your credit file.

For More Information:

If you have questions or would like to sign up with LifeLock over the phone, please call (To Follow) at no cost to you. A credit freeze means potential creditors cannot get your credit report. That makes it less likely that an identity thief can open new accounts in your name.

You have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). These include, among others, the right to know what is in your file; to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information; and to have consumer reporting agencies correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Ag Solutions IT LLC (ASI) located at 2803 N. Nebraska Avenue, York, Nebraska 68467, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to eight hundred twenty (820) Iowa residents. This notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, ASI does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On or about January 11, 2021, ASI became aware of potential unauthorized access to its network. ASI immediately began an investigation, with the assistance of counsel and third-party forensics specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the event. On January 29, 2021, ASI confirmed that folders on its systems may have been accessed or removed from its systems without authorization. ASI therefore undertook a time-intensive, thorough review of the potentially impacted folders and its internal files and systems in order to identify the information that was potentially impacted and to whom it related. On February 25, 2021, ASI determined that one or more of the folders contained personal information. ASI then undertook a diligent review of its internal files to identify the individuals to whom the data relates and the appropriate contact information for those individuals, which was completed on March 23, 2021. ASI thereafter worked to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible.

The information that could have been subject to unauthorized access includes name and Social Security number.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On April 12, 2021, ASI provided written notice of this incident to affected individuals, which includes eight hundred twenty (820) Iowa residents. Written notice was provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, ASI moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of ASI systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. ASI is also working to implement additional safeguards and training to its employees.	The data breach was a result of potential unauthorized access to Ag Solutions IT LLC (ASI)'s network on January 11, 2021, which was confirmed on January 29, 2021. Upon investigation, ASI determined that folders on its systems may have been accessed or removed without authorization. Therefore, it was a hack by an outside party or infected by malware.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

The Seven Hills School is writing to notify you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud). This notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. Blackbaud notified us and many other institutions on July 16, 2020, that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, which determined that there had been unauthorized access to its systems between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020, where backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Initially, Blackbaud informed us that the fields in the database backups containing personal information were encrypted and not accessible by the unauthorized individual. As a result, we posted a notice on the JagZone explaining our understanding at the time. However, further investigation determined that this was not the case, and Blackbaud informed us of their updated findings on September 29, 2020. Following receipt of the notifications about the incident from Blackbaud, we launched our investigation and worked with Blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved. On January 4, 2021, we determined that the Blackbaud backup file may have contained some of your information.

What Information Was Involved?

The Blackbaud backup file involved contained your name and Social Security number. Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and that there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What You Can Do:

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. As a precaution, Blackbaud is offering you a complimentary membership to Identity Monitoring and Fraud Resolution services for two years. This product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. These services are completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on the Identity Monitoring and Fraud Resolution services, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary two-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in the following pages.

What We Are Doing:

We are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that we, and Blackbaud, are taking in response. Blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

For More Information:

We regret that this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. Should you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact our incident response line at 1-855-723-1666 Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time.

FPI takes the privacy and security of all information within its possession very seriously, which is why I am writing to notify you of this incident and to inform you of steps that can be taken to help safeguard your information.

What Happened: On August 14, 2020, FPI learned that it had experienced a data security incident that disrupted access to certain of its systems. Upon discovering this incident, FPI took immediate steps to secure its systems prior to restoration. In addition, FPI retained independent cybersecurity experts to conduct an investigation in order to determine what happened. FPI learned that an unauthorized third party had gained access to certain FPI systems and that personal information stored on such systems was accessed or acquired without authorization. On March 3, 2021, following a thorough review of potentially impacted information, FPI learned that your personal information may have been accessed or acquired without authorization as a result of this incident. FPI then worked diligently to provide notification of this incident.

Please note that FPI is not aware of the misuse of any potentially impacted information in connection with this incident, and that FPI is notifying potentially impacted individuals out of an abundance of caution.

What Information Was Involved: The incident may have impacted your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number or other government identification card number, passport number, tax identification number, financial account information, online credentials, digital signature, payment card information, and/or medical information.

What We Are Doing: When FPI learned of this incident, FPI immediately began containment, mitigation, and restoration efforts. As set forth above, FPI also launched an investigation and engaged independent cybersecurity experts to determine what happened and whether sensitive information was impacted. In addition, FPI implemented additional security measures to further harden its digital environment in an effort to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. Finally, FPI reported this incident to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and will provide any assistance needed to hold the perpetrators accountable.

In connection with this incident, and out of an abundance of caution, FPI is offering complimentary identity theft protection services through Experian IdentityWorksSM. Enrollment instructions can be found on the next page of this letter.

You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear [Recipient],

We are writing to notify you of an incident that affected the confidentiality of your personal information. Please read this letter carefully for more information and to learn how you can take steps to protect your personal information.

What Happened?

We recently determined that between January 21, 2021 and March 1, 2021, fraudsters used information about you which they acquired elsewhere to obtain unauthorized access to your driver's license number through the online sales system on our website. We have reason to believe that this information could be used to fraudulently apply for unemployment benefits in your name. If you receive any mailings from your state's unemployment agency/department, please review them carefully and contact that agency/department if there is any chance fraud is being committed.

What Information Was Involved?

The data obtained by the fraudsters from GEICO was limited to your driver's license number.

What We Are Doing.

As soon as GEICO became aware of the issue, we secured the affected website and worked to identify the root cause of the incident. While we regularly maintain high security and privacy standards, we have also implemented and continue to implement additional security enhancements to help prevent future fraud and illegal activities on our website.

Although we don't know whether your driver's license number has been fraudulently used, we would like to offer you a one-year subscription to IdentityForce to help protect your identity from theft. If you would like to enroll in the IdentityForce identity-theft protection service, which includes Identity/Privacy Protection (fraud monitoring, dark web monitoring, and dark web scan) and Identity Restoration (fully managed restoration and $1 million identity theft insurance), please visit secure.identityforce.com/benefit/geico.

Dear <<Name 1>>,

Administrative Advantage, LLC (AA) provides billing support services to certain healthcare providers. AA is writing, on behalf of Remedy Medical Group, to notify you of a recent event at AA that may affect the privacy of some of your personal information. We have your information because we provide billing support services to Remedy Medical Group. While, to date, we have no evidence that your information has been misused, we are providing you with information about the event, our response to it, and resources available to you to help protect your information.

What Happened?

On July 2, 2020, AA became aware of unusual activity involving a single employee email account. We immediately began an investigation and worked quickly to assess the security of the email account. With the assistance of third-party computer specialists, on August 18, 2020, AAs investigation determined that an unauthorized person or persons may have accessed the email account between June 23, 2020, and July 9, 2020. Because we could not conclusively rule out unauthorized access to information in the account, we reviewed the contents of the email account to determine whether sensitive information was present at the time of the incident. Through this review, we determined that some of your information was present in the relevant email account. To date, AA is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information as a result of this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation determined that, at the time of the incident, the email account contained your name and <<Breached Elements>>. Please note that while our investigation has not identified any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we are providing you this notice to ensure you are aware of this incident.

What Is AA Doing?

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. AA has security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon learning of this incident, we moved quickly to respond. This included conducting an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists and engaging in steps to ensure the security of the impacted email account. We are notifying you so that you may take further steps to best protect your personal information, should you feel it appropriate to do so. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information, we are reviewing and enhancing existing policies and procedures and conducting additional workforce training to reduce the likelihood of a similar future event. We are also offering you access to identity theft protection services through TransUnion for 12 months at no cost to you as an added precaution.

What You Can Do.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you that the Fort Hays State University Foundation, along with many other institutions, were notified by Blackbaud, Inc. of a security incident. Blackbaud is the vendor that the FHSU Foundation uses to record and store information related to alumni and philanthropic giving to the institution. This notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file containing your information has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe that any data was or will be misused, disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What Happened

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified the FHSU Foundation and many other institutions that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. The time period of unauthorized access was between February 7 to May 20, 2020. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the Blackbaud services we use and the information provided by Blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. We worked with Blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved and determined on February 25, 2021, that the backup files contained certain unencrypted information pertaining to you.

What Information Was Involved

The backup file involved contained your name and Social Security number. Again, Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused, disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Additionally, we have taken steps to ensure that the files containing your information have been removed from the Blackbaud database.

What You Can Do

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. As a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary membership to identity monitoring services for two years. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration.

Additionally, we have removed all Social Security numbers from the Blackbaud database and enhanced our procedures to protect this information.

RE: Notice of Data Breach

Dear Valued Blade HQ Customer,

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know about a data security incident on the Blade HQ websites (bladehq.com, grindworx.com, arcform.com, or flytanium.com) that may involve your personal information.

Although we are unaware of any actual misuse of your information, we are providing notice to you and other potentially affected customers about the incident, and about tools you can use to protect yourself against possible fraud.

What happened?

An unknown, unauthorized intruder or intruders appears to have gained access to our hosted website servers and uploaded malware to our website www.bladehq.com, potentially gaining the capacity to skim customer transaction data as it was being entered by the customers purchasing or attempting to purchase our merchandise. Our investigation indicates that the intruders may have had this skimming capability from January 7, 2021, through March 22, 2021, and on April 11, 2021. The attackers may have gained access to customer transaction information if the customer entered new or updated information at the site during that time. Because you entered or changed your card information or personal information at bladehq.com during the suspected period of intrusion, we are notifying you about this security incident.

You may wonder why you are hearing about the incident now. When we first became aware of potentially unusual activity on our website in late March, we immediately hired cybersecurity experts and forensic investigators to assist in our investigation. Applicable legal requirements and best practices require that we conduct a complete investigation and cooperate and follow the required protocols of applicable governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions. We are also required by law to ensure that certain additional steps be followed before notifying customers. Now that those steps and requirements have been completed and our investigation concluded, we are reaching out to you.

What information was involved?

In the cases mentioned above, information that the intruder may have had access to includes your first and last name, address, email address, and any debit or credit card numbers with expiration dates and CVV codes that you may have entered on our website.

What we are doing.

Blade HQ values your privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. We have retained the services of a qualified cybersecurity forensic investigation firm to contain the breach, conduct a thorough review of the intrusion, and to ensure the security of the website now and in the future. The intruders' access and malware have been removed from our website, and we have deployed new servers and implemented additional security measures to prevent a recurrence of such an attack and to protect the privacy of our valued customers. We are also working closely with major credit card suppliers and governmental authorities to ensure that the incident is properly addressed.

What you can do.

Please also review the attachment to this letter (Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information) for further information on steps you can take to protect your information.

For More Information.

For further information and assistance, please call our response center at (855) 723-1664 Monday through Friday from the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central Standard Time, excluding major US holidays.

RE: Notification of Data Security Breach

Dear [Customer],

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. We are therefore notifying you of a data security breach of our computer system which may have involved your personal information. Although we are unaware of any actual misuse of your information, we are notifying you so you can take action along with our efforts to minimize or eliminate any potential harm.

We first became aware of the breach on March 27, 2021 when we were notified ransomware encryption had been installed on our computer system. We immediately began measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore the integrity, security, and confidentiality of all data. We retained CDW Corporation as an independent cybersecurity consulting firm. We have also been in contact with various law enforcement agencies which are conducting their own investigation. CDW completed its report on April 9, 2021. CDW believes initial access to our system started around February 28, 2021, although it could not say with certainty whether data had actually been acquired. The types of personal information which may have been obtained are customer contact information that would normally be found on our credit applications.

We recommend you remain diligent by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports. You should report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or the Attorney General. You may obtain free credit reports from the national credit reporting companies Equifax, Experian and TransUnion by calling 1-877-322-8228 or online at www.annualcreditreport.com.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear Smith & Company Clients,

We are writing to inform you about a recent incident that may have involved your personal information on behalf of Smith & Company CPAs. This follows up our email on April 3, 2021, when we first reported the incident.

What Happened?

We recently discovered that we were targeted by cybercriminals trying to obtain client data through our third-party software provider, Intuit.

On March 23, 2021, Intuit informed us that our Electronic Filing ID number used for tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was compromised. We immediately notified the IRS directly of the fraudulent activity, ceased the transmission of all returns potentially impacted, and worked with Intuit's Fraud Department to reapply for a new, secure Electronic Filing ID number for all tax filings going forward. We are proceeding with an abundance of precaution in this unfortunate situation, having notified all of our clients already of the potentially fraudulent activity in a prior email.

What Data Was Potentially Involved?

We believe that the client data files impacted may have included personal information associated with individual tax returns, such as full names, addresses, date of births, social security numbers, bank account deposit number, and other tax identification information.

What Are We Doing?

We are taking this incident very seriously by working with our expert Information Technology organization, a leading Cyber Security Firm, Intuit's Fraud Department, and the IRS to swiftly remedy the situation and take important precautionary security measures to proactively protect our Firm and our clients going forward. These measures include, but are not limited to, upgrading our servers, reinforcing our firewalls, administering vulnerability scans, and strengthening internal security protocols.

What Can You Do?

In conjunction with the IRS, we recommend the following:

- Get an Identity Protection PIN from the IRS. Starting this year, you can opt into using an IP PIN with the IRS to confirm your identity when filing your tax return. Here is the link to the IRS site to register for the IP PIN: https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin
- Know the Signs of identity theft. The IRS has a helpful guide for taxpayers: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/taxpayer-guide-to-identity-theft
- Remain Vigilant and Frequently Review all Credit Card Activity and Account Statements for Potentially Fraudulent Activity.
- Request Free Credit Reports be Sent to You. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. We recommend periodically obtaining credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus listed below directly to request a free copy of your credit report. When you get your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look in the inquiries section for names of creditors from whom you have not requested credit. Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names; the credit bureau will be able to tell if this is the case. Look in the personal information section for any inaccuracies in information (such as home address and Social Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone number on the report. Errors may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in writing. Information that cannot be explained should also be reported to your local police or sheriff's office because it may signal criminal activity.
- Place Security Freezes. You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. This will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, a security freeze takes control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of future requests or applications you make for a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving credit. By federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. If you want to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Experian
P.O. Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013

Atlanta, GA 30348-5788
1-800-685-1111

To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

- Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
- Social Security number;
- Date of birth;
- If you have moved in the past five (5) years, the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
- Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
- A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.);
- If you are a victim of identity theft, a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

- Place an Initial or Extended Fraud Alert. As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on your credit file. When a fraud alert appears on your credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify your identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. If you want to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:

Equifax: https://www.equifax.com/personal/ or 1-800-685-1111
Experian: https://www.experian.com/ or 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion: https://www.transunion.com/3 or 1-888-909-8872

You can also learn about identity theft prevention, fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take to protect yourself by contacting the consumer reporting agencies, the Federal Trade Commission, or your state Attorney General.

Enroll in Credit Monitoring. Sign up for a credit protection plan. If you do not already subscribe to one and would like to, please reach out to our office at (415) 458-5100. We will assist in providing appropriate identity theft prevention and mitigation services at no cost to the affected person for 12 months.

Re: Notice of Vendor Breach of Unsecured Protected Health Information

Doctors Medical Center of Modesto (the Hospital, we, or us) is committed to protecting your personal and medical information. This commitment includes notifying you if we believe that an incident may have exposed your medical information to any unintended individual(s).

On April 2, 2021, we learned that patient information provided to a former vendor, Medifies, was potentially made publicly accessible to the internet as a result of a misconfigured software update on a server used by a Medifies contractor for software development. Medifies provided virtual waiting room services to the Hospital. Upon discovery of the incident, we immediately contacted Medifies to remove the information from the internet-facing server, which they removed the same day, and launched an investigation. Medifies also retained a third-party forensic firm to investigate the incident. Medifies's investigation determined that the software update that caused the patient information to be made publicly available occurred in December 2019.

The patient information potentially involved in this incident included your first and last name, address, email address, date of birth, general procedure information, procedure date, physician name, and the name, address, email address, and cell phone of significant others who may have subscribed to receive updates regarding your procedure. Please note that not all data fields may have been involved for every individual. The limited information which was inadvertently involved did not list any medications, test results, or prognosis. It also did not include any individual's Social Security number, credit or debit card number, insurance/government plan, Medical Record Number, or financial account information.

Lastly, the incident did not involve the Hospital's systems, databases, or medical records system. At this time, we are not aware of any misuse of your information in connection with this incident. Although the investigation is ongoing, we are also not aware whether your specific information was actually accessed or viewed by anyone other than the individual reporting the issue to us. Because of the limited information involved in this incident, we do not believe that this incident will affect your credit or that you are at increased risk of financial harm or identity theft as a result of this incident. However, we have arranged to offer you identity monitoring services for a period of one year, at no cost to you. You have until April 23, 2022, to activate these services. Please call 1-877-583-2412 toll-free so that we can assist you in enrolling in these complimentary identity monitoring services. In addition, we always recommend that patients carefully review statements sent by healthcare providers and insurance companies and report any questionable charges to the provider or their insurance company as appropriate.

The protection of patient information is of the utmost importance to us, and we regret that this incident occurred. Although we previously ended our relationship with Medifies, we have continued to coordinate with them during the course of its investigation to ensure that your information remains protected. If you have any questions or would like additional information about the incident, please call toll-free at 1-877-583-2412. The call center is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 am until 5:00 pm (PDT) and is closed on weekends and legal holidays.

We deeply regret any concern this incident may cause you and want to assure you that we take this matter seriously.

Sincerely,

Warren J. Kirk
Chief Executive Officer

On the morning of April 3, 2021, Foodland was the victim of a ransomware attack.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation is ongoing, and at this time, we are unable to confirm the specific information impacted by this incident. However, based on the actions of the perpetrators, we believe they may have had access to systems storing information of current and former employees, beneficiaries, and dependents.

Confidential-for Intended Recipient Only

Date:_________________

Dear ________________________,

We are contacting you regarding a data security incident we discovered on April 17, 2021, at ClearVoiceResearch.com, LLC (ClearVoice). You are receiving this notice because you have used ClearVoice to sign up for a profile to participate in market research surveys, and your personal information was accessed. The privacy and protection of the personal information of our survey respondents are matters we take very seriously, and we recommend that you closely review the information provided in this notice for suggestions on how to protect yourself against potential misuse of your information.

1. What Happened?

On April 17, 2021, we received an email from an individual (unauthorized user) stating he accessed a backup file of one of our databases containing profile information of survey participants from August and September of 2015. This database was later discovered to have been posted online, for purchase by the public.

2. What Data Was Affected?

The data that was accessible may include the following: contact information from 2015 (name, e-mail address, home address, phone number, date of birth), passwords from 2015, and, as applicable, responses to various questions you may have answered as part of creating your profile on our platform which may include, but not be limited to, health condition, political affiliation, and ethnicity. It is important to note that the data that was accessible did not include national insurance numbers, social security numbers, ID numbers, credit card numbers, other financial information, or data collected from specific surveys you may have taken part in.

3. What Are The Potential Consequences For You?

It cannot be ruled out that the data sets mentioned above may be misused, and you may be contacted for purposes such as advertising. Further, it cannot be excluded that the accessible information may be used to prepare personal profiles, which could possibly be used in a commercial or political context.

4. What We Are Doing.

Upon receipt of the information from the unauthorized user, we immediately launched an investigation into the matter. Within an hour of receiving the email from the unauthorized user, we located the backup file, secured it, and eliminated any further exposure to the file in the cloud service. We also conducted a comprehensive search of all of our databases and files and determined that no other files had been exposed, and other files were properly secured. We will continue to take steps necessary to minimize any disruption that this compromise may have caused and to prevent such incidents in the future. Furthermore, ClearVoice forced a password reset for all persons that participate in our panels and members whose information had potentially been exposed. Further, ClearVoice has implemented additional security measures designed to prevent a recurrence of such an incident and to protect the privacy of your data.

5. What You Can Do.

Given the types of information that were accessible as part of this incident, we do not believe that there is a risk of identity theft from this incident. However, we encourage you to take usual prudent precautions with your personal information. You should not open email or text messages from any unknown sender. You should never open untrusted web links. You should never provide personal information via email or over the phone to any unverified entity. If you continue to use the same password as in 2015, even for other accounts or platforms, there is a risk that an unauthorized access of your accounts may occur, and you should change your password settings of those other accounts respectively.

6. For More Information.

We have set up a webpage https://hosted.clearvoicesurveysmail.com/FA32/ to provide information, which will be updated, as additional information becomes available. If you have further questions regarding this incident, please email Steven Ray at datainquiries@clearvoiceresearch.com.

We truly apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience to our panel participants.

Sincerely,

The ClearVoice Research Executive Team	The breach was caused by an outside party who accessed a backup file of one of Clear Voice's databases containing profile information of survey participants from August and September of 2015, and the data was later discovered to have been posted online for purchase by the public.

Massachusetts and Rhode Island residents: You have the right to obtain a police report if you are a victim of identity theft.

For residents of all states: It is recommended that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing payment card account statements and monitoring your credit reports for unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, whether or not you suspect any unauthorized activity on your account. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. To order your free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com, or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. You can also order your annual free credit report by mailing a completed Annual Credit Report Request Form (available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alerts: You can place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus by phone and online with Equifax (https://assets.equifax.com/assets/personal/Fraud_Alert_Request_Form.pdf), Experian (https://www.experian.com/fraud/center.html), or Transunion (https://www.transunion.com/fraud-victim-resource/place-fraud-alert). A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. Initial fraud alerts last for one year. Victims of identity theft can also get an extended fraud alert for seven years. The phone numbers for all three credit bureaus are at the bottom of this page.

Monitoring: You should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.

Security Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency by certified mail, overnight mail, regular stamped mail, or by following the instructions found at the websites listed below. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze for yourself or your spouse or a minor under 16: (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; (5) Proof of current address, such as current utility or telephone bill, bank or insurance statement; (6) legible photocopy of government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and (7) if you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. It is free to place, lift, or remove a security freeze.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATES, INC. (NCMA) NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Northern California Medical Associates Inc. (NCMA) is providing notice of an event that may affect the privacy of certain patients' personal information. While we have no reports of identity theft or fraud as a result of this event, we take this incident seriously and are providing individuals with information about the event, the steps we have taken and are taking in response, and additional steps individuals can take, should they feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On March 3, 2021, NCMA detected unusual activity on its computer systems. Upon detection of the activity, we shut down portions of our network, reset passwords, and commenced an investigation that included working with computer forensic specialists to determine the nature and scope of the event. During the course of the investigation, we learned that unauthorized access to the NCMA network began on February 19, 2021, and culminated in unauthorized encryption of certain NCMA servers and workstations on March 3, 2021. On or about March 29, 2021, we confirmed that certain data from our systems was taken in the event. As a result, NCMA is providing this notice that information held by NCMA may have been viewed or taken by an unauthorized actor.

What Information Was Involved?

While we currently have no evidence that any information was used to commit identity theft or fraud, the types of information potentially acquired included: names, contact information, Social Security numbers, driver's license/state identification numbers, financial account information, medical record number/patient identification numbers, medical information (such as medical history, diagnosis, treatment information, physician information, and/or prescription medication information) as well as health insurance information.

What We Are Doing.

NCMA takes this incident and the security of personal information entrusted in our care very seriously. Upon discovery of the unusual activity, we immediately shut down portions of our network, reset passwords, and commenced an investigation. We restored the encrypted data and deployed additional monitoring tools on our network. We also notified law enforcement and are notifying regulators where necessary.

What You Can Do.

NCMA encourages all individuals to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements and explanation of benefits, and monitoring free credit reports for suspicious activity. We also encourage individuals to review the below Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information that includes additional action individuals may take to protect their information should they feel it appropriate to do so.

For More Information.

You can contact NCMA at 1-800-773-6150. You may write to NCMA at 3536 Mendocino Ave, #200, Santa Rosa, CA 95403. NCMA will be declaring Chapter 7 bankruptcy on May 5, 2021.

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

Monitor Your Accounts

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear [First name]:

We are writing to inform you of a recent security incident that involved the 21st Century Insurance online automobile insurance quoting tool.

What Happened?

I am writing to let you know that between January 20, 2021, and February 12, 2021, unknown malicious actors targeted the 21st Century auto quoting system to obtain various individuals' personal information. While we are still investigating this to determine exactly how this occurred, we believe your driver's license number may have been obtained. Upon discovery of this activity, we took immediate steps to prevent access to personal information and began working to identify the potentially affected individuals. We are notifying you and any consumers who we believe were affected by this incident. However, we believe some people receiving this letter may have made valid quote requests or had someone in their household make valid quote requests on our website during the applicable time period. Therefore, if a valid quote request was made on our website during the relevant time period, then it is possible that your information may not have been exposed in this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

We believe that the malicious actors had certain personal information about you such as name, address, and/or date of birth and used that information to obtain your driver's license number via the quoting system tool. We regret this happened and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and concern this causes you. We take our obligation to safeguard personal information seriously and are alerting you so you can take steps to help protect yourself. To do so, we encourage you to take the steps that are outlined below.

What We Are Doing.

CyberScout has been retained to help you with any questions or problems you may encounter related to this matter, including obtaining a credit report, credit monitoring, and placing fraud alerts on your behalf. To assist you, we are providing you with access to Single Bureau Credit Monitoring/Triple Bureau Credit Report* services at no charge. These services provide you with alerts for twelve months from the date of enrollment when changes occur to your Experian credit file. This notification is sent to you the same day that the change or update takes place with the bureau. In addition, we are providing you with proactive fraud assistance to help with any questions that you might have or in the event that you become a victim of fraud. These services will be provided by CyberScout, a company specializing in fraud assistance and remediation services.

To enroll in Credit Monitoring* services at no charge, please log on to https://www.cs11protect.com or cs11protect.com, click the Sign Up button, and follow the instructions to create your account. Enter your information and the following Access Code to complete your registration: <<Access Code>>. Next, click the Use Now link on the Monitoring Services tile to verify your identity and activate your monitoring services. In order for you to receive the monitoring services described above, you must enroll within 90 days from the date of this letter.

What You Can Do.

In addition to enrolling in Credit Monitoring, we recommend that you take the following precautions:

Order your free credit report

You are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three national credit bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's website at www.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Requests Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. Do not contact the three credit bureaus individually. They provide free annual credit reports only through the website or toll-free number.

When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors you did not initiate, and any inaccurate personal information, such as your home address and telephone number. You should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in writing. You should also call your local police department and file a report of identity theft. Get and keep a copy of the police report because you may need to give copies to creditors to clear up your records or to access transaction records. Even if there are no signs of fraud, you should continue to check your credit report every three months for the next year.

Place a fraud alert on your credit bureau file

A fraud alert instructs issuers of credit to use more than normal scrutiny for any request for new or additional credit. This adds a layer of protection, but it might limit your ability to obtain instant credit (for example, an instant credit card offered by a retail store). You can place a fraud alert by contacting one of three national consumer reporting agencies directly at:

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. For this reason, we are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident.

What happened?

On or about April 4, 2021, internal SEIU 775 Benefits Group IT personnel detected certain anomalies in SEIU 775 Benefits Group's data systems, including what appeared to be the potential deletion of information.

Fraud Alert: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze: Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost.

A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

This letter is to inform you of an incident that may affect your personal information related to your recent COVID-19 test. Please read this letter carefully.

What Happened

On February 15, 2021, we sent a package of documents via UPS to our document scanning vendor for scanning. We thought the package was delivered successfully and on time, but recently learned that the package has not been delivered to our vendor to date. We have worked diligently with UPS to locate the missing package and resolve this issue. According to UPS, its records show that it tried to deliver the package to our vendor but was unable to do so because the vendor's office was closed. UPS returned the package to its facility for redelivery later, but then never completed redelivery. UPS has searched its facilities and spoken with its drivers, but not been able to locate the package in its facility or explain why it was not delivered to our vendor. We will continue to work with UPS to search for the package, but in the meantime wanted to notify you about this incident.

What Information Was Involved

The missing package contained documents related to your recent COVID-19 test that we completed at Exceltox, including your full name, address, phone number, Social Security number, date of birth, gender, medical provider, patient ID, test type, collection date, insurance provider, and insurance plan name and policy number and/or group number.

At this time, we do not have any information to suggest that the information contained in the missing package has been disclosed to anyone or that the information has been used for any improper purpose. However, because UPS has been unable to locate the package, we are notifying all potentially affected individuals of the potential disclosure out of an abundance of caution.

What We Are Doing

We take the protection of your information seriously and are taking steps to continue investigating this incident, help mitigate the potential for harm, and prevent future incidents from happening. We remain in contact with UPS and will continue to assist its efforts to locate the missing package.

Dear <<Name 1>>,

SAC Health System is writing to inform you of a recent data security event that occurred on Netgain Technology, LLC's (Netgain) systems that may impact the privacy of some of your information. Netgain was a third-party service provider to SAC Health System that stored SAC Health System's medical record database until 2016. Please note that this event did not occur at SAC Health System, nor did it impact the security of SAC Health System's computer systems in any way. Although SAC Health System is currently unaware of any misuse of your information, we are nonetheless providing you with information about the incident, SAC Health System's response, and steps you may take to protect against misuse of your information, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On January 15, 2021, Netgain disclosed to SAC Health System that a data security incident resulted in the potential for unauthorized access to certain Netgain servers containing SAC Health System's data between November 15, 2020, and November 22, 2020. SAC Health System immediately began working with Netgain to determine the nature and scope of this potential access and also launched its own independent investigation into this matter. As a result of this investigation, on April 20, 2021, SAC Health System was able to confirm that certain of its data on Netgain's servers was indeed subject to unauthorized access. SAC Health System then immediately undertook a review of the data at issue and, out of an abundance of caution, decided to notify all individuals who potentially had data on the Netgain systems at the time of the Netgain event.

We are writing to inform you about an incident that involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you may consider taking.

What Happened?

On March 31, 2021, we identified an unusual pattern within an application process normally used by our agents to obtain quotes for prospective customers. We immediately began an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm and notified law enforcement. The investigation revealed that an unknown actor used addresses not obtained from State Auto to initiate quotes for auto insurance for individuals with whom State Auto had no prior relationship. By starting a quote, a prefill process was triggered that populated some of your information. The activity occurred between March 11 and March 31, 2021.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation revealed that the prefill process populated some or all of the following information: first and last name, drivers license number, date of birth and/or gender.

Single Bureau Credit Monitoring

You will receive alerts when there are changes to your credit data, for instance, when a new line of credit is applied for in your name. If you do not recognize the activity, you will have the option to call a Kroll fraud specialist, who will be able to help you determine if it is an indicator of identity theft.

Fraud Consultation

You have unlimited access to consultation with a Kroll fraud specialist. Support includes showing you the most effective ways to protect your identity, explaining your rights and protections under the law, assistance with fraud alerts, and interpreting how personal information is accessed and used, including investigating suspicious activity that could be tied to an identity theft event.

Identity Theft Restoration

If you become a victim of identity theft, an experienced Kroll licensed investigator will work on your behalf to resolve related issues. You will have access to a dedicated investigator who understands your issues and can do most of the work for you. Your investigator will be able to dig deep to uncover the scope of the identity theft, and then work to resolve it.

Kroll's activation website is only compatible with the current version or one version earlier of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. To receive credit services, you must be over the age of 18 and have established credit in the U.S., have a Social Security number in your name, and have a U.S. residential address associated with your credit file.

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111

Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742

TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts:

There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud-an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes:

You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports?

There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com

TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com

Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze?

A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

Additionally, we recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit files by following the recommended privacy protection steps outlined in the enclosed Breach Help Consumer Tips from the California Attorney General. You may also contact the three credit bureaus directly and request all three credit reports be sent to you, free of charge, for your review.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<FirstName>><<LastName>> (Care of <<FirstName>><<LastName>>),

As the University of California (UC) previously disclosed in communications to students, staff and faculty, and retirees in early April, UC experienced a security event with its Accellion file transfer appliance (FTA).

You are a valued member of the UC community and we wanted to provide you with up-to-date information on what happened and what we are doing. This notice includes important reminders about the free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services available to you.

A version of this notice is available in Chinese and Spanish.

What Happened?

On December 24, 2020, UC's Accellion FTA was the target of an international attack, where perpetrators exploited a vulnerability in the application. Over 100 organizations were similarly attacked, including universities, government agencies, and private companies. In connection with the attack, certain UC data was accessed without authorization. We identified on March 29, 2021, that some of this data was posted on the Internet. When the University discovered the issue, we took the system offline and patched the Accellion vulnerability. We are in the process of transitioning to a more secure solution. The University is cooperating with the FBI and working with external cybersecurity experts to investigate this matter and determine what happened, what data was impacted, and to whom the data belongs.

There is no evidence that other University systems were impacted.

To inform and protect the UC community, UC notified community members via email, hosted interactive workshops at several campuses, and posted online information about the event and how individuals can protect themselves. The University also arranged for free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for the entire University community through Experian IdentityWorks.

Many UC community members have already signed up for this service. If you have not already signed up for services through Experian IdentityWorks, we encourage you to register.

Visit the Experian IdentityWorks website to enroll by April 10, 2022:

For adults with a Social Security number, visit www.experianidworks.com/rr3bplus

For minors with a Social Security number, visit www.experianidworks.com/minorplus

For individuals without a Social Security number, visit http://www.globalidworks.com/identity1

Enter your activation code: [ACTIVATION CODE]

RE: Notice of Data Breach

What Happened?

County of Orange Social Services Agency (SSA) is writing to you because of a privacy/security incident that was discovered in April 2018 within the Agency's Family Self-Sufficiency and Adult Services Division. A former employee with access to SSA computer systems may have inappropriately accessed and used your and/or your family's information without a business purpose.

What Information Was Involved?

The following information items about you and your family may have been accessed: First Names, Last Names, Phone Numbers, Addresses, Social Security Numbers, Dates of Birth, Passports, Driver's Licenses, E-mail Addresses, Birth and Marriage Certificates, Immigration Documents, Tax Documents, Bank Statements, Utility Records, Employment Records, and Medical Records.

What We Are Doing:

SSA deeply regrets any inconvenience this incident may cause you. Upon discovery of the incident, SSA conducted both a thorough internal investigation as well as a joint investigation with law enforcement. The employee's access was immediately deactivated, and the employee subsequently separated from the County. To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, SSA is reviewing and updating its safeguarding controls, privacy and security policies and procedures, and retraining our employees.

What You Can Do:

We recognize this breach may be of significant concern to you and your family; therefore, we are taking steps to ensure your privacy and benefits information are better protected in the future.

Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Personal Information:

While Galyen is not aware of the misuse of any information involved in this incident, Galyen encourages potentially affected individuals to remain vigilant by taking the following steps:

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state. Contact information for the FTC is: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20580, www.consumer.ftc.gov and www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-438-4338.

You also have certain rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA): These rights include to know what is in your file; to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information; to have consumer reporting agencies correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information, as well as others. For more information about the FCRA, and your rights pursuant to the FCRA, please visit http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201504_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf.

Personal Information of a Minor:

You can request that each of the three national credit reporting agencies perform a manual search for a minor's Social Security number to determine if there is an associated credit report. Copies of identifying information for the minor and parent/guardian may be required, including birth or adoption certificate, Social Security card and government-issued identification card. If a credit report exists, you should request a copy of the report and immediately report any fraudulent accounts to the credit reporting agency. You can also report any misuse of a minor's information to the FTC at https://www.identitytheft.gov/. For more information about Child Identity Theft and instructions for requesting a manual Social Security number search, visit the FTC website: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0040-child-identity-theft.	The breach involved unauthorized access to the organization's network by a malicious actor.

Re: Notification Pursuant to Iowa Code 715C.2

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Insurance Technologies Corporation (ITC), to notify you of a breach of security involving the personal information of six hundred fifty-eight (658) individual insureds who reside in Iowa. ITC is submitting this notification on behalf of its insurance broker customers who opted in to have ITC send written notification to your Office in accordance with Iowa Code 715C.2. The names of the customers on whose behalf ITC is submitting this notification and the total numbers of their potentially affected insureds who reside in Iowa, respectively, are attached hereto at Exhibit A. ITC notified the customers listed in Exhibit A on March 30, 2021.

NATURE OF THE INCIDENT

ITC provides insurance brokers with technology solutions including a software application called AgencyMatrix, which offers a cloud-based agency management system that allows brokers to effectively manage their business. On February 27, 2021, an unauthorized third party gained access to the AgencyMatrix application and acquired certain personal information of insureds that was stored in that application. Upon learning of the issue, ITC immediately commenced an investigation through which it contained the incident on March 4, 2021. ITC also notified federal law enforcement and retained an independent forensics firm to assist with the investigation and analysis of the incident.

As part of its investigation, ITC determined that the personal information involved in this incident may have included individuals' full names and Social Security numbers and/or drivers license numbers, and possibly their dates of birth and/or usernames and passwords to the AgencyMatrix application. To date, ITC has no evidence that any of the information potentially involved in this incident has been misused.

STEPS TAKEN RELATED TO THE INCIDENT

ITC provided substitute notice in USA Today on April 29, 2021. ITC began mailing notifications to the potentially affected Iowa residents on May 10, 2021, via U.S. Mail on behalf of its insurance broker customers who opted in for ITC to do so. A sample copy of the notice that was sent to those individuals is attached hereto at Exhibit B. In order to be fully transparent, we attached a sample copy of the notice that includes the most comprehensive description of personal information involved in this incident. With that said, not all of these data elements apply to the entire population of individuals affected. Thus, we sent the same version of this notice with different variations of data elements affected with respect to each Iowa resident.

Out of an abundance of caution, ITC provided the potentially affected Iowa residents whose Social Security numbers and/or drivers license numbers may have been involved in this incident with credit monitoring and identity protection services through TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, at no charge for a period of twelve (12) months, and has also set up a dedicated support line that will be staffed to answer any questions individuals may have about this incident or the services available to them. Shortly after discovering this issue, ITC reset all valid passwords to the AgencyMatrix application.

In response to this incident, and as part of ITC's continuous commitment to enhance the security of its infrastructure, ITC has implemented additional security measures to help protect the privacy of the information stored on its systems. ITC continues to evaluate and modify its security measures, not only in response to this specific incident, but also in response to the ever-changing security landscape.

If you have any further inquiries concerning this notification, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Jennifer L. Urban
Foley & Lardner LLP

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

Monitor Your Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);

2. Social Security number;

3. Date of birth;

4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;

5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;

6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, etc.); and

7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Should you wish to place a credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

You can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. Please note that in order to file a report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some proof that you have been a victim. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should also be reported to law enforcement and your state Attorney General. This notice has not been delayed by law enforcement.

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit. How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

Additional information for residents of the following states:

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear John Smith,

Health Plan of San Joaquin (HPSJ) is writing to let you know that one or more people outside of HPSJ have accessed some of our employee email accounts without our permission. As a result, some of your information may have been seen by them, and although HPSJ has no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of information, there is a risk that this information has been, or could be misused. We are offering free resources to help prevent this from happening to you. If you would like to use these services, you must sign up for them by September 30, 2021, following the directions provided in the materials that follow. This letter has more information about what happened, our response, and the free resources that can help you protect your personal information from possible misuse. The confidentiality, privacy, and security of your information is one of our highest priorities.

What Happened?

On October 12, 2020, we learned of unusual activity affecting HPSJ's email system. At that time, HPSJ was not aware of any unauthorized access to HPSJ's email system, but we launched an investigation to learn everything we could about what happened, and brought in a computer specialist that has expertise in email security incidents like this one to assist our investigation.

From our investigation, on October 23, 2020, we learned that an unknown person(s) accessed certain HPSJ employee email accounts between September 26, 2020, and October 12, 2020. Once we identified the affected email accounts, we immediately changed the passwords for those email accounts to stop any further access by the unknown person(s).

Next, we reviewed the messages in the email accounts to determine if any personal information was in the affected HPSJ email accounts so that we could contact anyone whose information may have been seen without authorization. We are sending you this letter because your information was present in the affected HPSJ email accounts. We do not know if your information was actually seen by the unknown person(s) who accessed the accounts. We only know that your information may have been seen because it was present in the email accounts that were accessed.

What Information Was Involved?

The information present in the email accounts at the time of the incident may have included your first and last name as well as your HPSJ member ID number, Social Security number, claim ID number, date of birth, health insurance information, medical ID number, medical record number (MRN), prescription information, and treatment information.

What We Are Doing.

Although we do not know for sure that any of your information was seen or misused, we are notifying you about what happened so that you may take further steps to help protect yourself from identity theft or fraud if you wish to do so.

We are offering you free identity monitoring services for 12 months through Equifax (a private company with a lot of experience helping people with matters like this) as an added precaution. If you would like to use these resources, you must sign up for them by September 30, 2021. HPSJ will pay for the cost of these services. More information about these services is included with this letter on a separate page with the heading, Steps You May Take To Help Protect Your Information.

What You Can Do.

We also recommend that you watch out for identity theft and any signs of fraud using your personal information. You should review your bank and credit card account statements, credit reports, and any insurance benefits or other similar forms for suspicious activity or errors. Please also read the enclosed Steps You May Take to Help Protect Your Information.

For More Information.

We understand you may have questions that are not answered in this letter. If you have questions, please contact our free help line at 1-800-691-6229 (TTY: 1-855-535-1808), Monday through Friday, between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time. An interpreter will be provided free of charge if you need it.

Protecting your information and protecting you from identity theft or fraud is very important to us, and we are committed to working with you to make sure that happens.

Sincerely,

Health Plan of San Joaquin

Dear Zocdoc User,

Notice of Data Breach

At Zocdoc, we understand how important your personal information is, and we work hard to protect it. Out of an abundance of caution and in compliance with regulatory requirements, we are writing to inform you that some past or current staff members at medical or dental practices where you previously booked an appointment may have had access to Zocdoc's system, which contains your personal information (as detailed in the What Information Was Involved section of this letter), after their authorization was changed or revoked. Importantly, we have no reason to believe, at this time, that your personal information has been misused in any way.

What Happened

As you know, Zocdoc allows you to book appointments with doctors who list available appointment times at their medical or dental practices on our platform. Each practice registered with Zocdoc receives usernames that allow staff members to access Zocdoc's system (the Provider Portal), and view appointments and other information you provide when booking an appointment.

Beginning in August 2020, we learned of programming errors that allowed some past or current practice staff members to access the Provider Portal after their usernames and passwords were intended to be removed, deleted, or otherwise limited. Notably, these practices and their current and former staff members have direct obligations to maintain the security and confidentiality of the personal information of their patients, and we have no reason at this time to believe that your information was disclosed outside of these practices and staff members.

We have notified each practice affected by these errors so that they may conduct an internal assessment as an additional precaution. It is possible that you may receive a separate notification from these practices (or the health system with whom they are affiliated).

What Information Was Involved

To the extent that any personal information was accessed, it would include your: name, email address, phone number, and appointment history (i.e. the times and dates of your past appointments) with that practice, and additional information such as insurance member ID, social security number, and any relevant medical history that you may have provided to the practice via Zocdoc in connection with an appointment booked through our service. If you used your Zocdoc account to book an appointment for another individual, or referenced a primary or secondary insurance holder other than yourself on your check-in forms, any personal information you provided about these individuals may also have been accessible.

It is important to note that the following types of information could not have been accessed, because Zocdoc does not collect or store such information: credit card numbers, debit card or PIN numbers, bank account information, radiological or diagnostic reports, or any medical records from a healthcare provider regarding your treatment.

What We Are Doing

As soon as we learned of these programming errors, we launched a thorough investigation of our software and code. We repaired these errors, and the affected usernames can no longer access our system. We have also strengthened our security practices and are taking	Based on the information provided, it appears that the breach was caused by the actions of past or current staff members at medical or dental practices where the user had booked an appointment. Zocdoc's system, which contains the user's personal information, was accessed after these employees' authorization was changed or revoked.

What Happened?

The company conducted a comprehensive review of the data and, on April 25, 2021, determined that the unauthorized actor could have accessed your name and driver's license number. We reported this incident to law enforcement.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation revealed that your name and driver's license number could have been accessed.

Sugarfina recently began investigating suspicious activity reported by a credit card company.

On or around January 15, 2021, the investigation determined that Sugarfina was the victim of a sophisticated cyber-attack and on March 25, 2021 determined that this attack may have allowed unauthorized actors to gain access to certain customers' payment card information used to make purchases on www.sugarfina.com between November 1, 2019, and September 3, 2020.

Following these determinations, Sugarfina took steps to confirm the identity of the customers whose payment card information may have been used at www.sugarfina.com between November 1, 2019, and September 3, 2020. Sugarfina also took immediate steps to secure its website. You can safely and securely use your payment card on Sugarfina's website.

Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Personal Information

Monitor Your Accounts

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Should you wish to place a credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

You can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud.

UL determined that the incident resulted in unauthorized access to certain personal information. UL then analyzed the data to assess the personal information that was accessed.

Although we are not aware of any evidence indicating that your personal information has been sold or is being misused, we are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution so that you can take steps to protect yourself.

The incident impacted your name, Social Security number, and date of birth.

Attachment 1: Additional Information

You should be cautious about using email to provide sensitive personal information, whether sending it yourself or in response to email requests. You should also be cautious when opening attachments and clicking on links in emails. Scammers sometimes use fraudulent emails or other communications to deploy malicious software on your devices or to trick you into sharing valuable personal information, such as account numbers, Social Security numbers, or usernames and passwords. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has provided guidance at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing. You should review your financial statements and accounts for signs of suspicious transactions and activities. If you find any indication of unauthorized accounts or transactions, you should report the possible threat to local law enforcement, your State's Attorney General's office, or the FTC. If you are a resident of Rhode Island, you have the right to obtain a police report. You will find contact information for some of those entities below. If you discover unauthorized charges, promptly inform the relevant payment card companies and financial institutions.

Fraud Alert Information

Whether or not you enroll in the credit monitoring product offered, we recommend that you consider placing a free Fraud Alert on your credit file. Fraud Alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. A Fraud Alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. Fraud alerts last one year. Identity theft victims can get an extended fraud alert for seven years.

Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately. You may also contact any of the consumer reporting agencies or the FTC for more information regarding fraud alerts. The contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is:

On April 27, 2021, we completed this review and determined your information may have been accessible. While access to your personal information has not been confirmed, we are providing you this notification out of an abundance of caution.

Dear Sir or Madam:

On behalf of our client Accucom Corporation (Accucom), we provide this letter to your office as notice of a recent data security incident.

On December 16, 2020, Accucom became aware of the existence of unauthorized code running on its website's databases. Accucom immediately removed the code, notified the FBI, reconfigured access controls, changed passwords, and retained national data security experts. Accucom confirmed that from May 25, 2020, through December 16, 2020, the unauthorized code may have copied Accucom customers' names and credit card details. No social security numbers or other financial account information were at risk. A total of 301,065 individuals, including 2,340 Iowa residents, may have been affected by this data security incident.

Accucom does not collect its customers' addresses but did not want to rely entirely on substitute notice so it engaged in lengthy requests for assistance from all the credit card issuers involved. All but one credit card brand refused to assist in mailing notices to potentially affected individuals, resulting in notice being mailed to 46 Iowa residents. Individual notice to these 46 Iowa residents was provided on May 27, 2021. With regard to the remaining affected individuals who Accucom was unable to identify mailing addresses for, Accucom provided these individuals notice via email, mass media notice, and a posting on the Accucom website. A copy of the mailed letter and emails provided to potentially affected Iowa residents is attached hereto.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 716-898-2102 or dgreene@beckage.com.

We take this incident seriously, and this letter provides details of the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against possible misuse of your personal information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On January 21, 2021, we discovered suspicious activity in our network environment. We immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the activity and contacted the FBI. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized actor entered our environment between January 21 and 23, 2021, accessed certain files, and took a limited number of files. Therefore, we conducted an extensive review process to analyze the contents of the files potentially accessed to determine what, if any, sensitive information was contained within them. On May 4, 2021, and in the weeks following, we determined that the potentially accessed files contained sensitive information of certain individuals, including you. However, we do not currently have evidence that the files containing your personal information were actually taken by the unauthorized actor. Our investigation remains ongoing, but we wanted to notify you as soon as possible.

What Information Was Involved?

We determined that the following information related to you may have been present in the files that were potentially accessed by the unauthorized actor: name, Social Security number or National ID, date of birth, and driver's license number.

What We Are Doing.

We take the confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care seriously. Upon discovery, we immediately commenced an investigation to confirm the nature and scope of the incident. While the investigation remains ongoing, we are taking steps now to implement additional safeguards and review policies and procedures relating to data privacy and security.

We cannot confirm if there was any misuse of your personal or vision/hearing insurance information, but we cannot rule it out either.

What information was involved?
Your personal information or protected health information (PHI) may have been accessed before being deleted. This includes your Social Security number, member identification number, date of birth, and health insurance information. This information is part of your identity and tells others about you.

What we are doing?
We have taken the following steps to reduce the risk of this happening again:

- Investigated the cause of the incident.
- Reset passwords.
- Informed the FBI, who are investigating the matter.
- Sent letters to everyone whose information may have been involved, including you.
- Reviewed and strengthened our policies and procedures.

We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your information.

What you can do?

Under federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. If you wish to place a security freeze, please reach out to these major consumer reporting agencies:

Instead of a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost.

Businesses are required to take steps to verify a consumer's identity before extending new credit once they see a fraud alert on a credit file. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are eligible for an extended fraud alert. This is a fraud alert lasting seven years.

Maintaining the confidentiality and security of our patients' information is something Scripps Health takes very seriously. Regrettably, we are writing to inform you of an incident involving some of that information.

On May 1, 2021, we identified unusual network activity. We immediately initiated our incident response protocols, which included isolating potentially impacted devices and shutting off select systems. We also began an investigation with the assistance of computer forensic firms. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to our network, deployed malware, and, on April 29, 2021, acquired copies of some of the documents on our system. On May 10, 2021, we discovered that some of those documents contained patient information.

Upon conducting a review of those documents, we determined that one or more files may have reflected your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and/or driver's license number, health insurance information, medical record number, patient account number, and/or clinical information, such as physician name, date(s) of service, and/or treatment information.

We have no indication that any of your information has been used to commit fraud. However, as a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership of Experian IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Azusa Police Department Provides Notification of Data Security Incident

On March 9, 2021, the City of Azusa Police Department discovered that certain aspects of its computer systems were inaccessible. Azusa Police immediately contacted its law enforcement partners and began working with third-party specialists to determine the source of the incident and the extent of systems affected. The investigation determined that Azusa Police was the victim of a sophisticated ransomware attack and that certain systems and information were accessed by an unauthorized individual. Azusa Police refused to cooperate with the cybercriminal and did not pay any ransom.

On April 27, 2021, the investigation determined that certain Azusa Police information was acquired by the unauthorized individual during the incident. The information may have included Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, California identification card numbers, passport numbers, military identification numbers, financial account information, medical information, health insurance information, and/or information or data collected through the use or operation of an automated license plate recognition system. Although the Police Department has no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of information, it is providing notice to the public in an abundance of caution.

Azusa Police continues to review its network security policies and take additional steps to further enhance its security, as it takes the privacy and security of all information very seriously. The Department also established a dedicated assistance line to address questions individuals may have and to provide credit monitoring services to potentially impacted individuals.

Azusa Police encourages individuals to remain vigilant in regularly reviewing and monitoring their credit reports/account statements for suspicious activity and to detect errors. Additionally, individuals can review the steps provided in the notification to protect their information and contact the dedicated assistance line to obtain enrollment information for the credit monitoring services being offered.

For more information, Azusa Police has established a dedicated assistance line that can be reached at 855-535-1860, Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Pacific Time. This notice was not delayed by law enforcement.

Individuals wanting more information about steps they can take to protect their information can obtain a copy of their credit report at no cost from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. They can also take steps recommended by the Federal Trade Commission to protect themselves from identity theft. The FTC's website offers helpful information at www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

Individuals can contact one of the major credit reporting companies for assistance in placing a fraud alert or security freeze on their account. The contact information for TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax is provided in the notification.	The breach appears to have resulted from a ransomware attack by an unauthorized individual, which suggests that the breach was caused by a hacking activity.

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE:

We remind you that it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze
PO Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013
www.experian.com

TransUnion Security Freeze
PO Box 2000
Chester, PA 19016
www.transunion.com

Equifax Security Freeze
PO Box 105788
Atlanta, GA 30348
www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Monitor Your Accounts

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Re: <<Variable Data 2>>

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

I am writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by HCI, LLC (HCI), that may have involved your personal information. At HCI, we take the privacy and security of all of the information in our possession very seriously. That is why we are notifying you of the incident, offering you identity monitoring services, and informing you about steps you can take to help protect your information.

What Happened?

On September 2, 2020, HCI became aware of a possible data security incident involving our computer network. We immediately conducted an investigation and hired independent computer forensic investigators to help determine what happened. The investigation determined that an unauthorized individual accessed certain employees' email accounts some time prior to June 2020. We then hired a third-party vendor to conduct a thorough review of the impacted information. That review determined that the personal information of some individuals including our current and former employees may have been accessed by the unauthorized person. We then took steps to obtain your current address and notify you of this incident. We have no information at this time that your information has been misused.

What Information Was Involved?

The information potentially impacted includes your name and <<variable data 1>>.

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO FURTHER PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant and review your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC).

Copy of Credit Report:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state. Contact information for the FTC is: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20580, www.consumer.ftc.gov or www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-438-4338.

Re: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<Name 1>>,

We are writing to advise you of an incident (Incident) that may involve unauthorized access to some of your personal information on behalf of Progrexion ASG, Inc. (Progrexion), located at 257 East 200 South, Salt Lake City, UT 84111. Set forth below is important information concerning the Incident along with some resources that may help you protect against the possibility of misuse of your information.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On April 8, 2021, Progrexion discovered search patterns that indicated a malicious third-party was using Progrexion's public-facing platforms to request certain information to help individuals decide if Progrexion's assistance is required. While the information the malicious third-party obtained did not include your Social Security number or any passwords or access codes to accounts that you maintain, it appears that the malicious third-party may have already possessed this or similar information about you from some source other than Progrexion. The malicious third-party used this information to access Progrexion's public-facing platforms to possibly view your FICO score, account number or institution identity (e.g., name of a bank), and limited details about that account (e.g., if any payments were late).

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

The information that was potentially involved in the Incident may have included your FICO score, account numbers or institution identity (e.g., name of a bank), and limited details about that account (e.g., if any payments were late, balances, and the like). It is important to note that the third-party did not access from Progrexion your Social Security number, or any passwords or access codes to accounts that you maintain.

WHAT ARE WE DOING?

Progrexion is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. Upon discovering the third-party's actions, Progrexion took its public-facing platforms offline to prevent any additional fraudulent requests for information from being made. Progrexion is currently evaluating its platforms to determine if additional controls should be implemented to reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future. In addition, Progrexion has notified a law enforcement agency - the National Cybersecurity Communications and Integration Center (NCCIC) - to advise it of the Incident.

While the information potentially involved in the Incident did not include your Social Security number, or any passwords or access codes to accounts that you maintain, it appears that the malicious third-party may have already possessed this or similar information obtained about you from some source other than Progrexion.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Subject: MCCCD Data Security Incident Investigation Complete

Dear <<Name>>,

We are writing to inform you that the Maricopa County Community Colleges Districts (MCCCD) has completed its forensic investigation into the data security incident that occurred on March 16, 2021. Please read this email in its entirety for more information on the incident, MCCCD's response and findings, and steps you can take to further protect yourself.

What happened?

On March 16, 2021, MCCCD's third-party monitoring vendor detected suspicious activity on a system within the network. To protect our systems and data, we immediately implemented our incident response protocols and took all systems offline. We hired a team of experts to investigate the suspicious activity and guide us through the containment and restoration process.

The forensic investigation determined that MCCCD likely identified and prevented a potential ransomware attack. The investigation also identified an attempt to download a Maricopa directory file containing the names, dates of birth, email addresses, and hashed passwords for Maricopa user accounts. The passwords within the file are hashed, which means the passwords were unreadable without a key to decrypt or break the hash value. However, if you used a commonly known password, it may be possible for an attacker to crack the hash and identify your password. The forensic investigation found no evidence the Maricopa directory file left our system, but out of an abundance of caution, we did not permit MCCCD users to access applications unless they changed their password.

What information was impacted?

It's important to note that the student information and human resources management systems were not hosted within the MCCCD network and were completely unaffected by this incident. We are confident that no student or employee information from these systems, such as social security numbers, educational information, or financial data, was compromised as a result of this incident.

What we are doing and what you can do:

To increase protections against future incidents, we have accelerated the implementation of new security measures to layer on to the security protocols we had in place prior to March 16th. They include:

- Supplemental 24x7 endpoint detection and threat hunting software
- Additional deployments of multi-factor authentication for all MCCCD employees
- Forced password reset to all MCCCD users, including staff and students.

If you have already logged on and completed a password reset, then you do NOT need to do it again.

Going forward, we ask that you follow these guidelines relating to usernames/passwords:

- While on the network, do not ask websites or accounts that you visit to remember your password(s).
- You should avoid using your school email address/password combination for any accounts that are not school-related, and do not use your school password for other accounts.
- If you did, we recommend changing the passwords to those accounts.
- Do not re-use the same password for more than one website or account.

Included in this email are tips for creating strong and complex passwords, and details on steps that can be taken to further protect your information.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the MCCCD Customer Care Center through live chat with extended availability or you may call 1-877-310-1915 and choose option #5 Monday through Friday from 12 p.m. - 7 p.m. (Pacific Standard Time).

James Curtin

The breach was caused by a suspicious activity on the network that prompted an incident response protocol to be implemented. A forensic investigation indicated an attempt to download personal data including names, email addresses, and hashed passwords of user accounts. Although there was no evidence indicating that the attacker got hold of the Maricopa directory file that contains the personal data, the incident response team couldn't permit MCCCD users to access applications until they changed their passwords. They ensure that no student nor employee information was compromised as the student information and human resources management systems were not affected by the incident.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

At Alderson Broaddus University, we understand the importance of protecting the information we maintain. I am writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps that you may consider taking.

What Happened?

We completed an investigation into unauthorized access to some of our computer systems. Upon discovering the incident, we immediately took steps to secure our network, contacted law enforcement, and began an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized person obtained access to some of our systems at various times between January 22, 2021, and January 27, 2021, and took some files out of our network. We were not able to fully determine the files that were taken and so conducted a review of the files that may have been involved.

What Information Was Involved?

On April 29, 2021, we determined that some of your information was contained in the files that may have been taken by the unauthorized person, including your name and Social Security number.

What We Are Doing.

Your confidence and trust are important to us, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. To further protect information in our systems, we have implemented additional safeguards and technical security measures, including multi-factor authentication and additional password requirements.

What You Can Do.

While we have no indication that your information has been or will be misused, we wanted to notify you of this incident and assure you that we take it very seriously. Out of an abundance of caution, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring services at no cost to you for one year. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration.

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR IDENTITY MONITORING SERVICES

You have been provided with access to the following services from Kroll:

Triple Bureau Credit Monitoring

You will receive alerts when there are changes to your credit data at any of the three national credit bureaus, for instance, when a new line of credit is applied for in your name. If you do not recognize the activity, you will have the option to call a Kroll fraud specialist, who will be able to help you determine if it is an indicator of identity theft.

Fraud Consultation

You have unlimited access to consultation with a Kroll fraud specialist. Support includes showing you the most effective ways to protect your identity, explaining your rights and protections under the law, assistance with fraud alerts, and interpreting how personal information is accessed and used, including investigating suspicious activity that could be tied to an identity theft event.

Identity Theft Restoration

If you become a victim of identity theft, an experienced Kroll licensed investigator will work on your behalf to resolve related issues. You will have access to a dedicated investigator who understands your issues and can do most of the work for you. Your investigator will be able to dig deep to uncover the scope of the identity theft, and then work to resolve it.

Kroll's activation website is only compatible with the current version or one version earlier of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. To receive credit services, you must be over the age of 18 and have established credit in the U.S., have a Social Security number in your name, and have a U.S. residential address associated with your credit file.

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	The university's computer systems were accessed by an unauthorized person who took some files out of their network. The incident was investigated by a cybersecurity firm and law enforcement was contacted.

To whom it may concern,

We are writing on behalf of our client Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., including its operating divisions, Audi of America and Volkswagen of America (together “VWGoA”) regarding a security incident that affects residents of your state.

On March 10, 2021, VWGoA was alerted that an unauthorized third party may have obtained certain customer information. VWGoA immediately commenced an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this event. VWGoA also contacted federal law enforcement and retained outside data analytics and cybersecurity consultants. The investigation confirmed in early May 2021 that a third party obtained limited personal information received from or about United States and Canadian customers and interested buyers from a vendor used by Audi, Volkswagen, and some authorized dealers. This included information gathered for sales and marketing purposes from 2014 to 2019. VWGoA believes the data was obtained when the vendor left electronic data unsecured at some point between August 2019 and May 2021, when VWGoA identified the source of the incident. VWGoA discovered the information at issue included more sensitive personal information on or about May 24, 2021. VWGoA completed the analysis to identify which specific individuals were impacted on or about June 7, 2021.

This incident involves over 3.3 million individuals. For over 97% of the individuals, the exposed information consists solely of contact and vehicle information relating to Audi customers and interested buyers, including some or all of the following contact information: first and last name, personal or business mailing address, email address, or phone number. In some instances, the data also includes information about a vehicle purchased, leased, or inquired about, such as the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), make, model, year, color, and trim packages.

For approximately 90,000 Audi customers or interested buyers, the data also includes more sensitive information relating to eligibility for a purchase, loan, or lease. Nearly all of the more sensitive data (over 95%) consists of driver’s license numbers. A very small number of records include data such as dates of birth, Social Security or social insurance numbers, account or loan numbers, and tax identification numbers. VWGoA has retained IDX to offer free credit protection services to these approximately 90,000 individuals, which includes the following services for individuals who choose to enroll: twenty-four (24) months of triple bureau credit monitoring services, $1 million of insurance, and assistance in the event of identity theft.

Based on VWGoA’s investigation to date, the number of individuals impacted in your state is:
Number of individuals with only contact and vehicle information impacted: 9,807
Number of individuals with more sensitive personal information impacted: 146

Please note, VWGoA is verifying addresses against the National Change of Address database so these numbers may change slightly.

VWGoA will begin notifying affected individuals on June 11, 2021, regardless of the sensitivity of the data, and will include reminders to remain alert for suspicious emails or other communications. Individuals will receive one of the two sample letters attached from either Audi of America or Volkswagen of America. VWGoA will direct one letter toward individuals whose contact and vehicle information was impacted, and the other toward individuals whose more sensitive information was also impacted. VWGoA is also notifying the three major credit reporting agencies.

Protecting the security of personal information is of the utmost importance to VWGoA and VWGoA sincerely regrets any inconvenience this incident has caused. VWGoA is conducting a full security review with the vendor to identify if further security enhancements are reasonable and appropriate.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at +1 202.457.6407 or elliot.golding@squirepb.com.

Sincerely,

Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP

San Dieguito Union High School District (San Dieguito) is writing to inform you of an event that may impact the privacy of some of your students' personal information. We are providing you with information about the event and the steps you may take to protect against the possibility of misuse of your students' information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?
On or about April 12, 2021, San Dieguito became aware of a suspicious mass email communication that appeared to have been sent in batches to the student body. The email contained an attachment with a list of students and limited student information. Upon discovery, San Dieguito immediately launched an internal investigation to determine the nature and scope of the activity. Through this investigation, San Dieguito determined that a former student sent the email to the student body which contained an attachment.

What Information Was Involved?
The internal investigation confirmed that the email attachment contained student name, directory information, and username and password for your student's San Dieguito email account.

What We Are Doing.
We take this incident and the security of personal information within our care very seriously. Upon discovery of this incident, we immediately took steps to investigate the incident and notified students to change their email account credentials. As part of San Dieguito's ongoing commitment to the privacy of your information, we reviewed our existing policies and procedures and implemented additional safeguards to further secure the information in our systems. San Dieguito also notified regulatory authorities, as required by law.

What You Can Do.
As a best practice, San Dieguito encourages your student to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review account statements and to monitor credit reports for suspicious activity. Although no Social Security numbers were exposed by this event, you can find more information on the resources available to you and your student in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information. We also encourage your student to practice good password hygiene and to reset their password. We previously provided instructions on how to reset your student's email account password. Instructions on how to reset the password can be found at My.SDUHSD.net.

For More Information.
We understand that you may have questions about this incident that are not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please contact Miquel Jacobs at 760-753-6491 ext. 5555.

San Dieguito sincerely regrets any inconvenience or concern this incident may have caused you or your student.

Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information

Monitor Your Accounts
Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Should you wish to place a fraud alert or credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

Additional Information
You may further educate yourself regarding identity theft, fraud alerts, credit freezes, and the steps you can take to protect your personal information by contacting the consumer reporting bureaus, the Federal Trade Commission, or your state Attorney General. The Federal Trade Commission may be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580; www.identitytheft.gov; 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); and TTY: 1-866-653-4261. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. You can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. Please note that in order to file a report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some proof that you have been a victim. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should also be reported to law enforcement and your state Attorney General. This notice has not been delayed by law enforcement.	This is an unintended disclosure that was not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss. A former student at San Dieguito Union High School District (San Dieguito) sent a suspicious mass email communication with an attachment containing personal student information, such as student name, directory information, and username and password for students' SDUHSD email accounts. San Dieguito launched an internal investigation immediately upon discovering the incident and notified students to change their email account credentials. However, there is no indication that this was a result of intentional malicious behavior or physical loss of data.

- 3-bureau credit monitoring2 with email notifications of key changes to your credit reports.
- WebScan notifications3 when your personal information, such as Social Security Number, credit/debit card or bank accounts numbers are found on fraudulent internet trading sites.
- Automatic fraud alerts4, which encourages potential lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before extending credit, plus blocked inquiry alerts and Equifax credit report lock5.

1 The credit scores provided are based on the VantageScore 3.0 model. For three-bureau VantageScore credit scores, data from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are used respectively. Any one-bureau VantageScore uses Equifax data. Third parties use many different types of credit scores and are likely to use a different type of credit score to assess your creditworthiness.
2 Credit monitoring from Experian and TransUnion will take several days to begin.
3 WebScan searches for your Social Security Number, up to 5 passport numbers, up to 6 bank account numbers, up to 6 credit/debit card numbers, up to 6 email addresses, and up to 10 medical ID numbers. WebScan searches thousands of Internet sites where consumers' personal information is suspected of being bought and sold, and regularly adds new sites to the list of those it searches. However, the Internet addresses of these suspected Internet trading sites are not published and frequently change, so there is no guarantee that we are able to locate and search every possible Internet site where consumers' personal information is at risk of being traded.
4 The Automatic Fraud Alert feature is made available to consumers by Equifax Information Services LLC and fulfilled on its behalf by Equifax Consumer Services LLC.
5 Locking your Equifax credit report will prevent access to it by certain third parties.

Dear <<Name 1>>:

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident involving Blackbaud, Inc (Blackbaud) that has resulted in the exposure of your personal information. Archbishop Mitty High School takes the security of your information very seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this incident may cause. This letter contains information about the incident and resources we are making available to you.

What Happened
Blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that is used by Archbishop Mitty High School and many other educational institutions to organize and store information related to members of our community. In particular, Archbishop Mitty High School utilized Blackbaud's Financial Edge platform for student billing purposes. Certain historical student data stored on the Financial Edge platform included students' Social Security numbers. At the time, Blackbaud assured Archbishop Mitty High School that all social security numbers and dates of birth stored in Financial Edge were encrypted. However, in September 2020, Blackbaud advised Archbishop Mitty High School for the first time that social security numbers, and in some instances, dates of birth, were not in fact encrypted for certain legacy versions of Financial Edge, and that this information was compromised as a result of a cyber-attack on Blackbaud. In response to the September 2020 notice from Blackbaud, Archbishop Mitty High School opened a thorough internal review of the records maintained by our institution via Blackbaud and worked extensively with Blackbaud to determine the scope of this incident and its impact on Archbishop Mitty High School's student and alumni records.

What Information Was Involved
In late September 2020, Blackbaud advised Archbishop Mitty High School that backup files containing personal information of certain former students were exposed to an unauthorized individual(s) following a cyber-attack on Blackbaud. Specifically, these files contained personal information, including your Social Security number. These files may have also included other personal information such as your date of birth, mailing address, and telephone number.

According to Blackbaud, and as far as we know, there is no indication that any of the exposed information has been subject to misuse or to further dissemination. Blackbaud has also assured us that they have implemented several changes to protect your data from any subsequent incidents. Again, while we have no evidence that any information related to members of Archbishop Mitty High School's community has been or will be misused, we still encourage you to remain vigilant and immediately report any suspicious activity or suspected misuse of your personal information.

What We Are Doing
Archbishop Mitty High School takes the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. Ensuring the safety of your data is of the utmost importance to us, and we sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern that this may cause. In light of this incident, we are providing you with access to Single Bureau Credit Monitoring services at no charge for twenty-four months (please find instructions below). Further, we continue to monitor the situation and be in close contact with Blackbaud, and we will be sure to keep you apprised of any additional information as it becomes available.

What You Can Do
As mentioned above, Archbishop Mitty High School is providing you with access to Single Bureau Credit Monitoring services at no charge. Services are for twenty-four (24) months from the date of enrollment. When changes occur to your Experian credit file, notification is sent to you the same day the change or update takes place with the bureau. In addition, we are providing you with proactive fraud assistance to help with any questions you might have. In the event you become a victim of fraud, you will also have access remediation support from a CyberScout Fraud Investigator.

Re: Notice of a Data Breach

Dear Valued Client:

Please read this letter in its entirety.

What happened?

We recently became aware of a situation where an unauthorized party accessed one of our company's internal servers and company computers. We discovered this situation on April 27, 2021, and took immediate steps to shut down access to the devices. In addition, we immediately engaged third-party expert assistance to help us investigate, evaluate and respond to the situation.

What information was involved?

Based on their review of the situation and an examination of the impacted computing devices, our forensics specialists have indicated that some personal data belonging to you may have potentially been exposed to the unauthorized intruder. This data may have included personally identifiable information (PII), such as some combination of your Full Name, Address, Date of Birth, Social Security Number, and Banking Information. While we have no evidence that any of your personal information was compromised or misused in any manner, we are taking appropriate precautionary measures to ensure your financial security and help alleviate concerns you may have.

IRS strongly advises obtaining an Identity Protections PIN

The Identity Protections (IP) PIN is a 6-digit number assigned to eligible taxpayers. It helps prevent identity thieves from filing fraudulent tax returns with stolen Social Security numbers (SSNs). An IP PIN also helps the IRS verify taxpayers' identities and accept their electronic or paper tax returns for processing. The IRS issues IP PINs to confirmed identity theft victims once their cases are resolved. This process is unchanged. What is new is that any taxpayers who want an IP PIN, even if they are not victims of identity theft, may now obtain one as well.

Here's what you need to know before applying for your IP PIN:

This is a voluntary program.
You must pass a rigorous identity verification process to obtain an IP PIN. Spouses and dependents are also eligible for an IP PIN if they can verify their identities.
An IP PIN is valid for a calendar year.
You must obtain a new IP PIN each filing season, using the online IP PIN tool.
The online IP PIN tool is unavailable generally mid-November through mid-January each year.
Correct IP PINs must be entered on electronic and paper tax returns to avoid rejections and delays.

How to Get an IP PIN:

The fastest, easiest, and preferred way is by using the Get an IP PIN online tool. Here is how it works:

Go to IRS.gov/IPPIN, select the Get an IP PIN tool, verify your identity, and create an account
Once you have a username, password, and security code, you can enter the Get an IP PIN tool
Once in, your IP PIN will be revealed to you.

Unable to pass the online identity proofing?

There are alternatives available, but there will be a delay in obtaining an IP PIN. Here is how it works:

*Services marked with an * require an internet connection and email account and may not be available to minors under the age of 18 years of age. Please note that when signing up for monitoring services, you may be asked to verify personal information for your own protection to confirm your identity.

File a Form 15227 if you have a valid SSN or ITIN, an adjusted gross income of $72,000 or less, and access to a telephone. An IRS assistor will call you, validate your identity, and ensure that you receive an IP PIN the next filing season.

If you are ineligible for Form 15227, call the IRS to learn about in-person options.

Other important information:

You can also obtain more information about identity theft and ways to protect yourself from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC has an identity theft hotline: 877-438-4338; TTY: 1-866-653-4261. They also provide information online at www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

For more information:

While representatives should be able to provide thorough assistance and answer most of your questions, you may still feel the need to speak with Weiss & Company regarding this incident. If so, please call me at 858-362-9999 between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM Pacific Time, Monday through Friday.

At Weiss & Company, we take our responsibilities to protect your personal information very seriously. We are deeply disturbed by this situation and apologize for any inconvenience.

Sincerely,

Kenneth L. Weiss

Although we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we are providing you with details about the event, steps we have taken in response, and resources available to help you better protect your information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

We became aware of suspicious activity related to an employee's email account and promptly commenced an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the activity. The investigation determined that an email phishing campaign targeted certain employees' email accounts and resulted in unauthorized person(s) intermittently logging into the accounts between October 22, 2020, and January 12, 2021. However, the investigation was unable to determine which, if any, emails and attachments in the account were viewed by the unauthorized person(s). Out of an abundance of caution, we undertook a thorough review of the account's contents to determine whether they contained any sensitive information. We recently completed this review and determined, on May 3, 2021, that information related to certain individuals was present in the email account during the relevant time period. We took additional steps to identify address information for individuals such as yourself and worked to provide notice of this event as quickly as possible.

What Information Was Involved?

We cannot confirm if the unauthorized person(s) accessed or viewed any specific information relating to you. However, we determined that the information present in the relevant accounts included your <<b2b_text_2(DataElements)>>.

What We Are Doing.

We have taken steps to enhance the security of our systems, including resetting the affected employees' credentials, increasing conditional access protocols for email access outside of the United States, and requiring multifactor authentication for access to email. As part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy and security of information in our care, we are providing enhanced training to our broader employee base on how to detect suspicious emails. We are also in the process of reviewing our existing policies and procedures to better prevent future events.

As an added precaution, we are also providing you with 12 months of complimentary access to identity monitoring services through Kroll, along with guidance on how to better protect against the possibility of information misuse.

Re: Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear Sir or Madam:

Our office represents North Iowa Area Community College (NIACC) located at 500 College Drive, Mason City, Iowa 50401. Pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 715C and out of an abundance of caution, we are writing to notify your office of an event that may affect the security of information relating to six hundred eighty-seven (687) Iowa residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned after its submission.

Nature of the Data Event

On Tuesday, May 18, 2021, an unknown and unauthorized individual impersonated a NIACC employee and sent a phishing email to another NIACC employee requesting student information. The text of this email is attached as Exhibit A. This phishing attack led to the compromise of two documents containing student information and account balances. Within 30 minutes after the incident, the NIACC employee discovered they were a victim of a phishing attack. The NIACC employee immediately reported the incident to NIACC Administration. NIACC Administration contacted the school's Chief Information Officer immediately.

Within 24 hours, NIACC notified all potentially affected students by email about this incident. NIACC also notified all faculty and staff with a summary of the incident. NIACC Administration also reported the incident to the Mason City Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The first compromised document in this data security incident contained the following information for four hundred eighteen (418) Iowa individuals and included the following information: name, address, student identification number, social security number, cell phone number, home phone number, and student account balance.

The second compromised document in this data security incident contained the following information for two hundred sixty-nine (269) Iowa individuals and included the following information: name, address, student identification number, cell phone number, home phone number, and student account balance.

No other information was contained in both compromised documents.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On June 15, 2021, NIACC mailed written notices of this incident to all potentially affected individuals from the two compromised documents, which includes the total of six hundred eighty-seven Iowa residents (687). We have enclosed two anonymized versions of the letter. Persons whose social security numbers were discovered received a letter in the form of Exhibit B and persons whose social security numbers were not discovered received a letter in the form of Exhibit C.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

In addition to alerting students about the incident, NIACC has provided students with guidance to help them stay vigilant about protecting their information and incidents of fraud. NIACC recommended students review their account statements, monitor free credit reports, and report any suspicious activity or suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the Attorney General's office and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). NIACC provided the contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies and informed students of their right to place a security freeze on their credit reports. NIACC also recommended that students contact the NIACC Business Office to securely pay their tuition, housing fees, and student fees.

NIACC is also offering all potentially affected students with identity theft protection services through ID Experts. The services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed ID theft recovery services. NIACC has encouraged affected individuals to enroll and take full advantage of these services.

To help prevent this type of incident in the future, additional cybersecurity training has been required to help all faculty and staff identify and report future phishing emails. NIACC is also taking further remedial steps to strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure faculty and staff verify all requests for protected information and that they do not share this information absent appropriate encryption.

Contact Information

NIACC takes the privacy and security of its students' information seriously and is committed to protecting their information. Should your office have any questions regarding this notification or other aspects of the data security event, please contact us at (515) 242-2400.

Sincerely,

Brian McCormac

You are receiving this letter because you are a current or former member of Prominence Health Plan (Prominence), and we are providing notice of a recent security incident that may have involved your personal information. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, this letter provides you with more information about what happened and what we are doing in response.

What Happened?

On April 22, 2021, Prominence learned that its data system had been subject to an information security incident during which a third party gained unauthorized access to certain information. Prominence immediately took steps to change the credentials used to access its system, secure the impacted environment, conduct an investigation of what happened, and restore the impacted data from backups. The investigation determined that the incident occurred in November 2020. Importantly, Prominence's Membership Benefits and Services have not been interrupted.

What Information Was Involved?

The data that was accessed included (1) audio recordings of calls made to or from the Prominence call center, and (2) electronic image (PDF) files containing certain healthcare provider claim forms, and letters to patients with claim approvals or denials. The audio recordings often included a patient's full name, date of birth and member ID number, and the PDF files typically included a patient's name, date of birth, sex, member ID number, mailing address, and claim code. The incident did not include members' Social Security Numbers or financial information. Given the nature of the accessed data files, however, the personal information is not easy to obtain in a usable format.

The letter informs the recipient of a potential data security incident that may have impacted their personal information. The letter explains that while attempting to file the recipient's tax return in late April 2021, McFadden received an alert that a return had already been filed. He contacted the IRS and his tax software provider and hired independent computer forensic investigators to determine if there was a compromise of his network or the recipient's data. The investigation is ongoing, but to date, the investigators have not identified any signs of data access or exfiltration from McFadden's network. The letter provides information about steps the recipient can take to protect their information, including enrolling in identity theft protection services through IDX, reviewing bank account and financial statements, and filling out and submitting IRS Form 14039. The letter also provides instructions on what to do if the recipient received a fraudulent deposit from the IRS into their bank account. The letter recommends that the recipient contact their bank's fraud department and let them know that the money was deposited as a result of a fraudulent tax filing and that the deposit should be reversed as soon as possible. The letter provides additional resources and information for the recipient to protect their information and their rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.	Based on the information provided, it appears that there was an unintended disclosure not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss.

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

Monitor Your Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Should you wish to place a credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

What Happened?

On May 27, 2021, Amgen was notified by one of our service providers, ZS Associates (ZS), of a security incident in which an unauthorized party compromised a ZS service account and accessed and may have downloaded certain files related to Amgen between April 21, 2021, and May 14, 2021. ZS provides consulting and professional services to Amgen. On May 17, 2021, ZS identified and disabled the compromised account and has been working with law enforcement and outside experts to investigate the security incident.

What Information Was Involved?

Upon receiving notice from ZS, Amgen immediately commenced an investigation to better understand the nature and scope of the incident and any impact on Amgen patients and data. Additionally, we retained a third-party forensic firm to conduct a thorough investigation of the data and information. The incident did not affect Amgen's own systems. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of your information, we are working with ZS to evaluate their policies and additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future. We are also providing the legally required notification of this incident to the applicable State Attorneys General. Although no financial information or social security information was involved, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing you with complimentary credit and identity monitoring services.

We are writing to inform you of a data breach incident that occurred between February 6, 2021 and February 18, 2021, in which a third party gained unauthorized access to a limited number of our employees' email accounts. Upon discovery, we immediately secured the email accounts, began an investigation, and arranged resources to start identifying, informing, and assisting persons whose personal information may have been involved. During our review, we identified your information as having potentially been accessed, although we are not aware of any attempt to exploit this incident in a malicious way.

The personal data that may have been accessed includes your name, certain internal identifiers that we use, information about your vacations with a Royal Caribbean brand, your contact information, date of birth, gender, nationality, passport number, state driver's license or other government identification number, and/or tokenized or partial payment card information. To our knowledge, your information did not include your full, unencrypted payment card information, or social security number or equivalent taxpayer identifier. Therefore, we believe the risk of someone misusing your data is low.

We are taking this incident very seriously and have taken steps to strengthen our protection of personal information, including updating email access controls. We have not identified any further unauthorized activity since the breach was identified and contained in mid-February. We will continue to closely monitor and take further steps as appropriate to safeguard your personal data.

Although we are not aware of any attempts to exploit this incident in a malicious way, and although we believe the risk of someone misusing your data is low, third parties involved in the incident could attempt to use your personal information to take fraudulent actions. To reduce your risk of being subject to identity theft, you can monitor your financial accounts and your account statements for unusual or unauthorized activity over the next 12 to 24 months and promptly report any suspected identity theft to the police. You should be vigilant against possible phishing communications and emails that appear to be (but are not) sent from Royal Caribbean brand email addresses.

APPENDIX

Measures that you can take to protect yourself with regard to consumer credit reporting bureaus:

To help protect yourself against identity theft, you may consider placing a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report.

Fraud Alert: When you place a fraud alert on your credit report, businesses who pull your credit report will see that you may be a victim of identity theft. The company may then choose to verify your identity before they extend credit to anyone who purports to be you. This may make it harder for an identity thief to open more accounts in your name. To place an alert, contact any one of the three main credit reporting bureaus. That company is required to tell the other two bureaus about the alert. When you first place a fraud alert on your account, it will remain for at least 90 days, after which you can renew it. When you do place an alert on your report, be sure that all three major credit reporting companies have your current contact information so they can get in touch with you.

Security Freeze: A security freeze or credit freeze goes further than an alert and lets you restrict access to your credit report entirely, which in turn makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. This is because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If creditors cannot see your file, they may not extend the credit. A credit freeze does not affect your credit score. A credit freeze also does not prevent you from getting your free annual credit report, keep you from opening a new account, applying for a job, renting an apartment, or buying insurance. But if you are doing any of these, you will need to lift the freeze temporarily, either for a specific time or for a specific party, say, a potential landlord or employer. The cost and lead times to lift a freeze vary, so it is best to check with the	The personal information of Royal Caribbean Group guests was accessed through a data breach incident between February 6, 2021 and February 18, 2021, in which a third party gained unauthorized access to a limited number of employees' email accounts.

To Whom it May Concern,

I am writing on behalf of Maximus, Inc. to inform you of an incident that may have impacted personal information of Iowa residents collected in connection with services that Maximus provides to the Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM).

We promptly isolated the server and engaged a leading digital forensics firm to assist with an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident.

Maximus has concluded that the incident impacted names, dates of birth, DEA numbers, and Social Security numbers. We have identified 1,589 Iowa residents whose information was impacted by this incident. The total number of impacted individuals is 334,690.

Maximus has taken a number of steps to reduce the risks of this type of incident recurring, including isolating the affected server, engaging a leading digital forensics firm to investigate, and reviewing its existing server configurations and security processes.

Upon discovering the event, AMS moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of AMS systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. AMS is also working to implement additional safeguards.

We take the security and confidentiality of your personal information very seriously and want to provide you with information about the incident, the measures we have taken in response, and options for you to further protect your information.

What Happened?
We recently discovered suspicious activity originating from unauthorized access to an employee's email account. We immediately secured the email account and launched an internal investigation. The investigation revealed that an unauthorized person had accessed an employee's email account on April 6, 2021. On May 10, 2021, we concluded our investigation and determined that the email account contained personal information that was potentially accessible.

What Information Was Involved?
Although we could not determine whether any specific emails were accessed by the unauthorized person, we conducted a thorough review of all emails and attachments that were potentially accessible. We are notifying you because the email account contained a message or attachment with your personal information, including your <<b2b_text_1(DataElements)>>.

What We Are Doing

We are also continuing to educate our staff to ensure they are aware of these types of continuously evolving incidents.

What You Can Do

Re: Our Client: Wolfe Clinic, P.C.
Matter: Data Security Incident on February 8, 2021
Wilson Elser File #: 16516.01329

Dear Attorney General Miller,

We are writing on behalf of our client, Wolfe Clinic, P.C. ("Wolfe Eye Clinic"), regarding a potential data security incident that occurred on February 8, 2021. We take the security and privacy of the information in our control seriously and have taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

This letter is to inform you of the nature of the security breach, what information has been compromised, and the steps that Wolfe Eye Clinic is taking to secure the integrity of its systems. We have enclosed samples of the notifications made to the potentially impacted individuals, which includes an offer of free credit monitoring.

1. Nature of the Security Incident

Wolfe Eye Clinic is a network of eye care clinics providing eye care to patients across Iowa. On February 8, 2021, Wolfe Eye Clinic was the target of a cybersecurity attack that involved an unauthorized third party attempting to infiltrate Wolfe Eye Clinic's computer network, lock out Wolfe Eye Clinic, and then demand a ransom payment.

Upon detecting this incident, Wolfe Eye Clinic moved quickly to secure its network environment and launched a thorough investigation. The investigation was performed with the help of independent IT security and forensic investigators to determine the scope and extent of the potential unauthorized access to Wolfe Eye Clinic's systems and any sensitive information. Given the complexity and scale of the cyberattack detected, the full scope of information potentially impacted was not fully realized until May 28, 2021.

After the comprehensive forensic investigation into this incident concluded on June 8, 2021, Wolfe Eye Clinic discovered that individuals' name, mailing address, date of birth, Social Security number, and/or protected medical and health information may have been exposed. Wolfe Eye Clinic has had no reports of related identity theft as a result of this incident (February 8, 2021, to present).

2. Steps Taken

Wolfe Eye Clinic takes the security of all information in its control very seriously. Given this, Wolfe Eye Clinic is taking steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future by implementing additional safeguards and enhanced security measures to better protect the privacy and security of information in its systems. Wolfe Eye Clinic has also reviewed and taken steps to enhance its policies and procedures relating to the security of its systems and servers, as well as its information life cycle management.

Wolfe Eye Clinic values the safety of its patients' personal information and is therefore offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through IDX. IDX's services include: At least 12 months of credit monitoring and fully managed identity theft recovery services. With this protection, IDX will help the affected individuals resolve issues if their identity is compromised.

3. Contact Information

Wolfe Clinic remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information in its control. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Robert.Walker@WilsonElser.com or 601.499.8083.

Very truly yours,

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (Gallagher) is writing to inform you of a security incident that may have affected some of your information. Although we have no knowledge of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we want to provide you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against possible misuse of your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On September 26, 2020, Gallagher detected a ransomware event that affected our internal systems. As a precautionary measure, we took our systems offline, initiated response protocols, launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity and forensic specialists, implemented our business continuity plans to minimize disruption to our customers, and ensured the ongoing security of our systems.

We worked with the cybersecurity and forensic specialists to determine what may have happened and what information may have been affected. Our investigation determined that an unknown party accessed or acquired data contained within certain segments of our network between June 3, 2020, and September 26, 2020. While the investigation was able to confirm that certain systems were accessed, it was unable to confirm what information within those systems was actually accessed. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, Gallagher conducted an extensive review of the entire contents of the impacted systems.

On May 24, 2021, our investigation confirmed that the impacted data included information relating to certain individuals. Gallagher continued to work through June 23, 2021, to notify our business partners and to obtain address information for impacted individuals to provide accurate notice to impacted parties.

What Information Was Involved?

Although we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, and have no indication the information is in the possession or control of an unauthorized person or party, we are providing you this notification in an abundance of caution because certain information relating to you was accessed or acquired during this event. The impacted information relating to you includes your <<b2b_text_2(DataElements)>>.

What Are We Doing?

The privacy and security of employee information are among our highest priorities, and Gallagher has strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon discovering this incident, we immediately took steps to protect the privacy and security of client, partner, and employee information. We also reviewed existing security policies and implemented additional measures and enhanced security tools to further protect information in our systems. We reported this incident to law enforcement and regulatory authorities, as required by law.

In addition to providing notice of this event to you, we are also providing you access, at no cost, to identity and credit monitoring services for twenty-four (24) months through Kroll. Information and instructions on how to activate these complimentary services can be found in the Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information attached to this letter.

What Can You Do?

While Gallagher is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of any information as a result of this incident, we nonetheless encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. You may review the information contained <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>> <<address_1>> <<address_2>> <<city>>, <<state_province>> <<postal_code>> <<country>> <<Date>> (Format: Month Day, Year) ELN-XXXX in the attached Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information. You may also activate to receive the identity and credit monitoring services we are making available to you. There is no charge to you for the cost of this service; however, you will need to activate yourself in this service.

For More Information.

We recognize that you may have questions not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please call our dedicated assistance line at 1-855-731-3320 (toll-free), Monday through Friday (excluding U.S. holidays), 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Central Time. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident may cause you. Protecting information entrusted to Gallagher is very important to us, and we remain committed to safeguarding the information in our care.

Sincerely,

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you about a recent incident that may have involved some of your information. Hudson Envelope (Hudson) takes the confidentiality and security of the information we maintain very seriously.

What Happened?
Hudson was recently alerted to suspicious activity involving its e-commerce website. Upon learning this, Hudson promptly launched an investigation. Through this investigation, Hudson discovered that unauthorized code designed to capture cardholder data was present on the web server that hosts its e-commerce website between June 25, 2020, and January 11, 2021, when the code was discovered and immediately removed.

What Information Was Involved?
While present on the web server, the unauthorized code could have captured cardholder data, including cardholder names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and card security codes (CVV), entered during the checkout process by customers who placed orders on the website. We reviewed order information for customers who placed orders on the website while the unauthorized code was present to identify individuals whose information might have been involved. On May 20, 2021, we discovered that you placed an order on the website while the unauthorized code was present.

What We Are Doing.
We regret any concern or inconvenience this may cause you. To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, Hudson has implemented enhanced logging and additional security features within its e-commerce environment.

What You Can Do.
We encourage you to review your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. You should immediately report any such charges to your card issuer because payment card network rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely reported. The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card.

For More Information.
If you have questions, please call 1-855-731-3335, Monday-Friday, from 9:00 a.m. until 6:30 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding major U.S. holidays.

Sincerely,

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE
We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:
Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:
Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts:
There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes:
You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports?
There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:
Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze?
A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	Payment card data was captured by unauthorized code present on the web server that hosts the e-commerce website. Cardholder names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and card security codes (CVV), entered during the checkout process by customers who placed orders on the website were compromised.

As part of that relationship, Discovery maintains the Facilities email environment. Regrettably, we are writing to inform you of an incident involving unauthorized access to that email environment, which contained some of your information. While we have no indication that your information has been misused, this letter explains the incident, outlines the measures we have taken in response, and steps you can take.

What Happened?
On July 31, 2020, our investigation into suspicious email account activity identified unauthorized logins to two Facilities staff email accounts between June 22 and June 26, 2020. We immediately took steps to secure the accounts and a computer forensic firm was engaged to assist with our investigation. Because the investigation was unable to determine if any emails and/or attachments were actually viewed or acquired, we conducted a comprehensive review of the accounts contents to determine the type of information contained in the accounts and to whom the information related. We then worked with the Facilities to confirm contact information for potentially impacted individuals, which was completed on June 2, 2021. During this process, we determined some of your information was contained within the email accounts.

What Information Was Involved?
The information involved may include your name, address, date of birth, medical record and/or patient account number, health insurance information, financial account or payment card information, Social Security number and/or driver's license number; and/or clinical information, such as diagnosis, treatment information, and/or prescription information.

What We Are Doing.
We believe that the account access occurred as part of an attempt to divert invoice payments to the wrong place (not to access your information). Still, we wanted to notify you of this incident and assure you we take this very seriously. As a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership in Experian IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorksSM is completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more about identity theft prevention and IdentityWorksSM, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership and information about identity protection, please see the additional information provided with this letter.

To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we reinforced education with Facilities staff regarding how to identify and avoid suspicious emails and are making additional security enhancements to our email environment.

Monitor Your Accounts
Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report. Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below. As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Morgan Stanley values our relationship with you and we place the highest degree of importance on protecting your data. As your current or former stock plan administrator, we write to inform you of a data security incident relating to your personal information.

What Happened

In May 2021, a Morgan Stanley vendor that provides account maintenance services to our Stock Plan business notified Morgan Stanley that the vendor had suffered a data security incident. The incident involves your personal information related to your current or former stock plan account, which was obtained by an unauthorized individual. There was no data security breach of any Morgan Stanley applications in connection with this incident. The incident involves files that were in the vendor's possession, including encrypted files from Morgan Stanley. Although the files were encrypted while stored in a tool used by the vendor, we believe that the unauthorized individual was able to obtain the decryption key during the security incident.

What Information Was Involved

The following personal information was located in the files obtained from the vendor: name; address (last known address); date of birth; social security number; corporate company name.

What We Are Doing

Morgan Stanley has reviewed the vendor's remediation of the incident. According to the vendor, the vulnerability that led to this incident was remediated in January of 2021. Although the data was obtained by the unauthorized individual around that time, the vendor did not discover the impact to Morgan Stanley until May 2021. In addition, we have arranged with Experian to provide you with their Experian IdentityWorks credit monitoring and fraud detection services for 24 months at no charge to you. To take advantage of this offer, please visit [enrollment URL] before [enrollment end date] and use code [code] to enroll in this complimentary offer.

Avoiding Phishing. Please use caution when responding to third parties who request disclosure of your personal information via email, text or phone. This may include inquiries from third parties posing as bank officials, information security experts, government agencies and other trusted sources, in an effort to trick you into divulging your personal information. You should never provide personal information, such as usernames, passwords, government issued personal identification numbers (e.g., U.S. Social Security Numbers), account numbers or any other confidential personal information via email request or screen pop-ups. Legitimate agencies/companies do not ask for this type of information in an email. We will never ask for your account password by email or by phone.

Remain Vigilant. As always, you should monitor your statements for any activity you do not recognize. Contact us immediately to report any suspicious activity. You also should not click links or open attachments sent from a typical or unknown senders, even if they appear to be legitimate. Pay special attention to links that purportedly take you to websites or other resources related to this incident, or offer you services to assist with this incident. When in doubt, call your regular Morgan Stanley contact to verify the legitimacy of the communication.

Ordering Your Free Credit Report. You are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. To order your credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 877-322-8228. We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports.

Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act Rights: You also have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. More information is available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf.

Obtaining a Police Report: You may be entitled by state law to obtain a police report relating to this matter; however, to our knowledge, no such report exists. If you are the victim of identity theft, you also have the right to file a police report and obtain a copy of it.

Fraud Alerts and Security Freezes. You can place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, free of charge, by calling any of the toll-free numbers provided below. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. For more information on fraud alerts and security freezes, you also may contact the FTC as described below. You may have to submit personal information to obtain the security freeze, including name, Social Security Number, date of birth, and photograph of a government ID.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear Impactree community members,

Transparency with our community regarding the extent of the security incident Impactree experienced on July 1, 2021, is a top priority. Please read below for the latest updates.

Impactree [July 2, 2021]

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What happened?

We discovered alterations to the Impactree platform relating to our action content at 10:30 am PST on July 1. We responded within the hour by shutting down our servers as well as the Impactree platform (my.impactree.com) in order to complete a full data and security review. Our initial review concluded that the Impactree platform was accessed by an unauthorized user.

What Information Was Involved?

The scope of the unauthorized user's activity appears to be limited to alterations of public content hosted on the Impactree platform, namely action titles and descriptions. As part of an ongoing, intensive security review, we will be evaluating what personal account information may have been accessed during the intrusion, if any.

At Impactree, we take protecting our members' security and privacy very seriously. Out of an abundance of caution, we are going to operate as if this information may have been accessed until we can ascertain that it was not.

Personal account information stored on the platform consists of platform members' first and last names, email address, country, state, and zip code associated with your Impactree account (depending on the information you provided). Additional personal data may include the Impactree groups that you joined, the actions you completed on the platform, as well as the name and email of the person or organization that referred you to the platform. In a very small number of cases, personal data may also include phone number or street address (if you submitted it).

No personal financial information is stored on the Impactree platform. Any donations made to nonprofits found through actions on the platform are processed with the nonprofit directly via their respective donation systems. Impactree does not keep or store any financial information. Impactree does not keep or store social security numbers, driver's license information, identification card numbers, tax identification numbers, passport numbers, or military identification numbers. We have no reason to believe that any of Impactree's users or customers' financial or governmental information has been compromised.

What We Are Doing

An intensive internal security and database review is now underway to ensure that this is indeed the full scope of the unauthorized user's activity. We are working with Amazon Web Services and hired a third-party online security company for a full review of our platform to ensure that Impactree is implementing all appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.

What You Can Do

The Impactree platform is live again and ready for you to use. However, we have deleted all existing passwords and are asking everyone to reset their passwords. Visit this link to reset your password to regain access to your Impactree account:

Reset Password Link: https://my.impactree.com/account/forgot-password

We understand online security incidents can be unsettling, and we deeply apologize for this inconvenience. We look forward to continuing to empower you to take meaningful and measurable actions to make the world a better place -- today and every day. With strengthened security, we are eager to continue growing impact, together.

For More Information

If you have any questions, please contact us at support@impactree.com, so we may ease your concerns, or you can call Impactree Support at (415) 715-9814.	The unauthorized access to the Impactree platform was the result of a hacking incident, where an unauthorized user gained access to alter public content hosted on the platform.

Re: Notice of Data Incident

Dear <<Name 1>>:

We are writing to inform you of an incident that we believe affected certain parts of your personal information. The Paradies Shops, LLC and its Affiliates (Paradies Lagardere) operates retail stores and restaurants primarily in airports throughout the United States and Canada. In the course of operating our business, we obtained certain personal information about you.

From October 8 to October 13, 2020, we were the victim of a ransomware attack. The attack was not an attack on any system used to process information provided by customers at our stores, but affected only an internal, administrative system. The attacker uploaded these records to third-party servers. We launched an internal investigation and engaged the help of third-party forensic experts. After extensive review of the potentially compromised files, on May 20, 2021, we determined that one or more records contained certain parts of your personal information and required us to send you this notification.

Our investigation indicated that your name, as well as your <<breached elements>>, were contained in the file(s). We have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information. However, we are informing you of this incident in an abundance of caution.

We take the security of personal information very seriously. Upon discovery of the cyberattack, the Company took immediate action to secure our network and systems from further immediate harm. We also retained a third-party cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to confirm that no other company systems were impacted, as well as third-party forensic experts to perform extensive review of the potentially compromised data. Furthermore, we promptly reported the incident to federal law enforcement. As we look towards the future, we have taken security measures to strengthen our network against similar incidents in the future.

We also are notifying you so that you may take further steps to protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so. We also are providing you with access to 12 months of credit monitoring and identity protection services through Equifax at no charge to you.

Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information for further details, which describes the credit monitoring and identity protection services we are offering and how to activate them. We also encourage you to remain vigilant against the potential for identity theft and fraud and to monitor your credit reports for any potential suspicious activity.

If you have additional questions, please call our dedicated assistance line at 1-855-535-1844 (toll-free), Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time (excluding U.S. national holidays).

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident may cause you. Protecting your information is very important to us, as we know it is to you.

Sincerely,

Shirl Stroeing
Senior Vice President
Chief Information Officer

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Re: [Extra1] Dear SampleA.Sample:

Stride Inc. (Stride) writes to let you know about a data security incident that we discovered that affected some of your information. Because the security of information is of utmost importance to us, we are notifying you of the event as well as resources available to you to help protect your information, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On or around November 11, 2020, Stride was the victim of a ransomware attack. Ransomware is a form of attack in which, after gaining access to a system, the attacker encrypts a victim's files and then demands a ransom to restore access to the data. Educational institutions, from primary schools through higher education, are increasingly becoming a target of ransomware attacks. As soon as we discovered that our systems had been infected with ransomware, we quickly took steps to lock down impacted systems, notified federal law enforcement authorities, and began working with an industry-leading third-party forensic team to investigate and assist with the incident.

Working with third-party forensic investigators, Stride determined that an unknown actor may have gained access to Stride systems from November 4, 2020 to November 19, 2020. After careful consideration, we also decided to make a payment to the ransomware attacker, as a proactive and preventive step in exchange for assurance that the information obtained by the attacker from our systems would be returned to Stride and would not be released on the Internet or otherwise disclosed. While there is always a risk that the threat actor will not adhere to negotiated terms, based on guidance we have received about the attack and the threat actor, the company believes the payment was a reasonable measure to take in order to prevent misuse of any information the attacker obtained.

Once the incident was contained, Stride initiated a comprehensive review, with the assistance of industry-leading forensic specialists, to identify any information of individuals contained in the files affected by the incident. Stride also then undertook a comprehensive internal effort to reconcile the results of the third-party review and find contact information for the affected individuals.

[Extra4] As soon as Stride was aware that information was impacted, including yours, we worked as quickly as possible to notify you.

What Information is Involved?

Our review determined that the affected data contained your [Extra2] and name.

What Are We Doing?

As mentioned previously, we take this incident and the security of information in our care seriously. Importantly, we have no indication that any of the data affected in the incident has been or will be misused. Following the payment we made to the attacker, the attacker returned the data they claimed to have obtained from Stride's systems. Stride subsequently engaged an industry-leading third-party specialist to conduct a search for the data on the Internet (including the dark web) and found no evidence of data related to this incident being published, posted for sale, or otherwise disclosed.

What You Can Do.

As a matter of general practice, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. You may also review the information contained in the attached Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information. In addition, we are offering you access to complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services for [Extra3] months through Experian.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Benjamin D. Wanger, Counsel at Baker Law, wrote a letter on July 6, 2021, to the Consumer Protection Division Security Breach Notifications Office of the Attorney General of Iowa via email (consumer@ag.iowa.gov) regarding a security incident involving Invenergy LLC. The incident involved some of Invenergy's computer systems, and 4,436 Iowa residents were affected. Invenergy secured the systems involved and conducted an investigation with the help of a cybersecurity forensics firm. The investigation revealed that an unauthorized party may have accessed certain Invenergy computer systems between April 21, 2021, and May 17, 2021. Invenergy was unable to determine whether the unauthorized party viewed any files on Invenergy's servers. However, Invenergy reviewed the files on its systems and identified 4,436 Iowa residents whose personal information may have been accessible to the unauthorized party. Invenergy is providing written notice via United States Postal Service mail to the affected Iowa residents starting on July 6, 2021. Invenergy is also offering a complimentary two-year membership in credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Kroll to the affected Iowa residents. Invenergy has implemented additional security measures to enhance the security of its network and retrained its employees concerning data security. The rewritten notification letter to the affected Iowa residents includes information about the incident, the measures taken by Invenergy, and steps the affected individuals can take to ensure their personal information is secure.

Re: Security Breach Notification

Dear Director Brauch,

We are writing on behalf of our client, North Iowa Community Action Organization (NICAO) (located at 218 5th Street SW, Mason City, Iowa 50401), to notify you of a security breach incident involving five-hundred and twelve (512) Iowa residents.

Nature

On March 31, 2021, we became aware of suspicious activity related to an employee's email account. After discovering the incident, we promptly secured the impacted email account and began taking steps to determine the nature, scope, and extent of the incident. On approximately May 10, 2021, NICAO concluded its forensic investigation and determined that an unauthorized individual gained access to five employee email accounts via a phishing email. Further, the forensic investigative findings are inconclusive as to whether the personal information was actually obtained.

After concluding the forensic investigation, NICAO initially identified 58 Iowa residents whose personal information was potentially accessed. On May 26, 2021, NICAO provided written notification to these potentially impacted individuals in a substantially similar form as the enclosed letter (attached as Exhibit A).

NICAO continued performing a comprehensive and detailed review of the potentially impacted email accounts. As a result, on July 1, 2021, NICAO concluded its search for potentially affected individuals and located all their recent contact information. Finally, as stated above, the forensic investigative findings are inconclusive as to whether the personal information was actually obtained, but as of now, NICAO has no evidence indicating misuse of its data or information. However, out of an abundance of caution and due to the impacted email account containing personal information, NICAO proactively is providing notice to your office and will provide notice to the potentially affected individuals.

Notice and NICAO's Response to the Event

On July 8, 2021, NICAO will mail written notifications to the potentially affected Iowa residents, in accordance with Iowa Code 715C.1-2, in a substantially similar form as the enclosed letter (attached as Exhibit A). Additionally, NICAO intends to provide the potentially impacted individuals the following:

- Free access to credit monitoring services for at least twelve months (12)
- Guidance on ways to protect against identity theft and fraud, including steps to report any suspected activities or events of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank.
- The appropriate contact information for the consumer reporting agencies along with information on how to obtain a free credit report and place a fraud alert and security freeze on their credit file.
- A reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports.
- Encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Finally, NICAO is working to improve its cybersecurity policies, procedures, and protocols, implementing any necessary additional safeguards to strengthen its cybersecurity infrastructure and further train its employees on best practices to minimize the likelihood of this type of incident occurring again.

RE: Notice of Data Breach/Security Incident

Dear <First Name> <Last Name>,

At North Iowa Community Action Organization, we value transparency and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know about a data security incident that may involve your personal information.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On March 31, 2021, we became aware of suspicious activity related to an employee's email account. After discovering the incident, we promptly secured the impacted email account and began taking steps to determine the nature, scope, and extent of the incident. Our investigation revealed that an unauthorized individual gained access to the employee's email account via a phishing email. At that time, we began a comprehensive review of the emails to determine what information and individuals were involved and locate the most recent contact information for each. We recently concluded our review and believe that some of your information could have been accessed and or potentially obtained. However, we have no evidence indicating that your personal information was misused. Finally, we believe the unauthorized individual was attempting to access payroll information and that your information was therefore likely not the target of the unauthorized access.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

The information that could have been involved included	An unauthorized individual gained access to five employee email accounts via a phishing email, which allowed them access to potentially impacted individuals' personal information. The forensic investigation concluded that the nature, scope, and extent of the incident are inconclusive as to whether the personal information was actually obtained.
Insufficient information	Insufficient information provided to determine the type of breach.
Insufficient information	There is not enough information available to determine the type of breach.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: CNA Financial Corporation (CNA) experienced a ransomware attack. The company has no evidence that any personal information has been or will be misused. However, CNA wants to inform customers of the incident and the measures taken in response. On March 21, 2021, CNA discovered the attack and immediately hired cybersecurity firms to assist in responding and investigating the incident. The investigation revealed that the threat actor accessed certain CNA systems from March 5, 2021, to March 21, 2021. During this time, the threat actor copied a limited amount of information before deploying the ransomware. However, CNA was able to recover the information, and there was no indication that the data was viewed, retained, or shared. The recovered information contained some personal information, including names and Social Security numbers. CNA reported the incident to the appropriate law enforcement authorities, including the FBI. The company implemented additional measures to enhance the security of its network, systems, and data. CNA is offering a complimentary 24-month membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM to help protect personal information. Customers can activate their membership by October 9, 2021. For more information, customers can contact CNA.	The breach was caused by a ransomware attack which was confirmed by CNA Financial Corporation.

To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

- Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
- Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
- TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft, as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

- Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
- TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
- Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or	The unauthorized access to Guess Inc.'s systems and attempt to encrypt their systems, along with the subsequent discovery of unauthorized access to the company's systems for a period of several weeks, indicates that the breach was caused by an outside party, likely a hacker or group of hackers.

What Happened?

On May 8, 2021, BAD became aware of a suspicious activity related to one of BAD employees' computers. Upon discovery of this incident, BAD promptly engaged a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. The forensic investigation was completed on May 27, 2021. The investigation confirmed that BAD had been the victim of a cybersecurity incident. Therefore, BAD worked to identify the specific individuals and the type of information that may have been compromised in order to send out notice of the incident to these individuals.

What Information Was Involved?

The types of information impacted varied by individual. However, the information present within the affected servers and workstations may have included your name, address, date of birth, social security number, taxpayer identification number, financial account information, and tax statements. At this time, we have no reason to believe that your personal information has been misused by any third parties. But out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to inform you of this incident.

We are committed to ensuring the security of all personal information in our control. The privacy of the people we provide services to is very important to us and we will continue to do everything we can to protect it.

What You Can Do

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious or unauthorized activity.

You may also enroll to receive the credit monitoring and identity theft protection services we are making available to you. Again, we are making these services available to you at no cost; however, you will need to enroll yourself in these services.

In addition, security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file.

We would like to reiterate that, at this time, there is no evidence that your information was misused. However, we encourage you to take full advantage of the services offered.

For More Information

We recognize that you may have questions not addressed in this letter.

The incident is described to have affected servers and workstations, indicating the breach was due to hacking rather than another type of breach.

WHAT HAPPENED

We recently learned in late March 2021 that we had been the victim of a cyber attack. The attack occurred in late January 2021 and involved the compromise of a third-party service used for secure file transfer for many clients, including Community Memorial Health System located in Ventura, CA.

Upon learning of the incident, we immediately launched an investigation and have since ceased using the third-party service that had been compromised. We have cooperated with federal law enforcement and engaged leading cybersecurity experts in connection with investigating and responding to the incident. Based on the nature of the incident, it has taken time to accurately determine what data was impacted.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by Sierra Nevada Primary Care Physicians (Sierra Care Physicians) that impacted a limited amount of your protected health information (PHI), including your name and credit card information. Your medical record and any treatment information was not impacted and remains secure.

We take the privacy and security of your information seriously, and sincerely apologize for any concern or inconvenience this may cause you.

What happened:

On May 20, 2021, we received a call from the District Attorney's office informing us that two envelopes containing receipts from our practice were discovered in the back of a suspect's vehicle. The perpetrators were arrested and the envelopes containing the receipts were recovered by the District Attorney's office. We were informed that the receipts were from the period of January 1, 2019, to March 20, 2019. We have reviewed our payment records and identified anyone who may have paid a bill during this time frame, whether the payment was made at the front desk via credit or debit card, by mail, or over the phone. We wanted to notify you of this incident as it appears that you made a payment during this period of time.

What information was involved:

If you paid at the front desk via debit or credit card, the information included on the receipt is very limited and we do not believe there is any risk this information could be misused. Information on credit or debit card receipts include your name, the name of the practice, the amount of the charge, and the last 4 digits of your card. If you paid by phone or by mail, then your name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, CVV number, signature, name of practice, and amount charged was present on the receipt.

What we are doing:

Although we took steps to protect this information prior to the incident, we had already taken steps to enhance our security of this information before we received the call from the District Attorney's office. All receipts are stored in a locked room that only two people have access to, and credit or debit card numbers are blacked-out on the receipts. Although we think misuse of your information is unlikely, we are offering identity theft protection services through IDX, the data breach and recovery services expert. IDX identity protection services include: 12 months of CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services.

While we cannot definitively confirm that your personal information was affected, it is possible that it might have been as your transaction(s) occurred during the above-referenced period.

Upon discovering the incident, we immediately contracted with a leading cybersecurity firm to conduct a thorough forensic investigation and will notify you if there are further significant developments. We have implemented additional security measures to prevent the reoccurrence of such a breach and to protect the privacy of our customers. The additional security measures include the following:

eJuice Direct Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information

1. Monitor financial accounts.

As a first step, we recommend that you closely monitor your financial accounts and if you see any unauthorized activity, you should promptly contact your financial institution. We also suggest that you submit a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission by calling 1.877.438.8228 (I.877.IDTHEFT) or online at www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov.

2. Review your credit reports.

As a second step, you may want to contact the three U.S. credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) to obtain a free credit report from each by calling 1.877.322.8228 or by logging onto www.annualcreditreport.com. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot a problem and address it quickly.

3. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus.

You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069
Atlanta, GA 30348-5069
www.equifax.com

Experian Fraud Reporting

TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year. If you are a victim of identity theft, you have the right to an extended fraud alert which is good for 7-years.

4. Place a security freeze.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit file free of charge. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name; social security number; date of birth; current and previous addresses; a copy of your state-issued identification card; and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or telephone bill.

5. Obtain additional information.

You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies.

Dear <Individual>,

Out of an abundance of caution, we are writing to inform you of a cybersecurity incident which affected the SN Servicing Corporation (SN). The cybersecurity incident may have resulted in the potential compromise of some of your data. This letter contains information about the incident and information about how to protect your personal information going forward. SN considers the protection of sensitive information a top priority, and sincerely apologizes for any inconvenience as a result of the incident.

What Happened

On or about October 15, 2020, SN discovered unauthorized access to its network. Upon discovery, SN immediately terminated the access and retained a specialized cybersecurity forensic team to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the Incident. The forensics team first identified the name and locations of files that were exfiltrated from the firewall records. This investigation concluded on or about November 24, 2020. Based on the results of the investigation, it was determined that an unauthorized party may have been able to access sensitive personal information for some of our borrowers.

SN was able to quickly identify a subset of documents which were believed to contain sensitive information for some borrowers. In the interest of notifying the borrowers as quickly as possible, a preliminary notice was provided for that collection of documents as quickly as possible. A data mining vendor was then hired to review the remaining documents to identify any additional individuals that may have been affected and what data may have been exposed. The data mining vendor provided its results on or about April 27, 2021.

SN engaged in a substantial data validation process to verify the accuracy of the data and reconcile to internal records. Immediately after concluding its validation procedures, SN procured credit monitoring for affected individuals and drafted notices to individuals, consumer credit reporting agencies, and state regulators as appropriate.

What Information Was Involved

While we have no reason to believe that your information has been misused as a result of this incident, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution and for purposes of full transparency. Based on the investigation, the unauthorized party may have had access to one or more of the following data elements: name, contact information, date of birth, social security number, and loan/borrower information. Please note that not every data element was present for every individual. While we appreciate that the incident may be concerning, please note that SN is not aware of any instances of misuse of sensitive data.

What We Are Doing

SN engaged a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct an investigation of the incident. Since the incident, SN has continued to strengthen its security posture. Additionally, we have also obtained complimentary credit monitoring for all affected individuals. We encourage you to take advantage of the complimentary credit monitoring services. We are making these services available to you at no cost; however, you will need to enroll yourself in these services.

What You Can Do

We recommend that you continue to remain vigilant in monitoring your personal information. The easiest way to do this is to take advantage of the complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft services we are offering to you. Details regarding these services are included in a separate attachment to this letter. To reiterate, we are making these services available to you at no cost; however, you will need to enroll yourself in these services.

There are additional steps you can take to protect yourself which are contained in the supplement to this letter titled Additional Important Information. The protection of your information is a top priority, and we sincerely regret any concern or inconvenience that this matter may cause. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call [PHONE NUMBER] Monday through Friday, between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM Central time.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (Gallagher), located at 2850 Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008, and are writing to notify your Office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to one thousand one hundred twenty-seven (1,127) Iowa residents. The investigation into this matter and notification to the affected Gallagher clients and individuals is ongoing. This notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission and as the investigation identifies additional Iowa residents affected. By providing this notice, Gallagher does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

Gallagher is a consulting, risk management, claim administration, and insurance brokerage firm that provides related advisory services to its clients. In order to provide these services, Gallagher receives information from its clients. On or about September 26, 2020, Gallagher detected a ransomware event impacting internal systems. Gallagher promptly took systems offline as a precautionary measure, initiated response protocols, launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity and forensic investigators, and implemented business continuity plans to minimize disruption to Gallagher clients, and ensure the ongoing security of Gallagher systems.

Gallagher worked with the cybersecurity and forensic investigators to determine what may have happened and what information may have been affected. Gallagher's investigation determined that an unknown individual accessed data contained within certain segments of the Gallagher network between June 3, 2020, and September 26, 2020. While the investigation was able to confirm that certain systems were accessed, it was unable to confirm what information within those systems was actually accessed. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, Gallagher worked with third-party forensic specialists to conduct a programmatic and manual review of the entire contents of the impacted systems to determine the presence of certain information present at the time of this activity and to whom the information relates. On May 24, 2021, Gallagher's investigation confirmed that the impacted data included information relating to certain individuals.

Gallagher continued to work through June 23, 2021, to confirm the accuracy of the information so it could begin notifications to its business partners and to obtain address information for impacted individuals to provide accurate notice to impacted parties. While the information is not the same for each affected individual, the potentially impacted information includes name, Social Security number, and/or financial account information.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On or about June 30, 2021, Gallagher began providing written notice of this incident to data owners and certain affected individuals in which it has a direct relationship and the threshold requirement to notify your Office was not yet met. On or about July 16, 2021, Gallagher continued providing written notice to additional affected individuals. While notification to impacted clients and individuals is ongoing, to date Gallagher has provided written notice of this incident to approximately one thousand one hundred twenty-seven (1,127) Iowa residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A. Gallagher also posted notice of this incident on its website and issued a press release. A copy of Gallagher's website notice is attached here as Exhibit B and a copy of the media notice is attached here as Exhibit C. This notice may be supplemented if it is determined a significant number of additional Iowa residents will receive notice and at the request of clients.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, Gallagher worked diligently to investigate and respond to the incident, secure the impacted systems and protect the privacy and security of client, partner, and employee information, determine what personal information was impacted, and to which Gallagher clients the information belonged. Gallagher is also working to implement additional safeguards and enhanced security tools to the Gallagher network, reviewed existing security policies and are providing additional training to employees regarding cybersecurity. While Gallagher is not aware of any attempted or actual misuse of the impacted information, Gallagher is providing access to credit monitoring services for twenty-four months through Kroll to individuals whose personal information was affected by this incident, at no cost to these individuals. Additionally, Gallagher is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud and encouragement to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports. Gallagher is also providing information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud. Gallagher also notified law enforcement and is cooperating with their investigation.

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO FURTHER PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely.

You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC at Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, D.C. 20580, or online at consumer.ftc.gov and www.ftc.gov/idtheft, or to the Attorney General in your state.

We took immediate steps to terminate the attackers' access and developed and deployed a security patch. We enlisted a leading cybersecurity forensics firm to assist us in fully investigating the incident. The investigation revealed that attackers used malicious code to acquire credit/debit card information entered while booking reservations at properties that use our online booking system. The investigation identified malicious activity as early as January 2019 along with compromised credit/debit card information from reservations made between approximately January 31, 2019, and approximately May 28, 2019, and also between approximately February 22, 2021, and June 14, 2021.

Who and What Information Was Involved:
If you are receiving this letter, your payment card was likely involved in the incident for reservations made online directly with a hotel or resort between approximately January 31, 2019, and approximately May 28, 2019. You may call the number below for more information. Information at risk may have included your name, address, phone number, email address, credit/debit card number, expiration date, and security code/card verification code. No bookings were affected.

What We Are Doing:
We are taking steps to help prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future. Since the incident, we fixed the software vulnerability and are consulting with cybersecurity experts to identify and implement additional controls to further enhance our online booking system's security.

What You Can Do:
You should carefully review the credit and debit card statements for any payment cards you have used to make an online reservation. If you identify any suspicious activity, immediately contact your financial institution.

More Information:
We have set-up a toll-free number you may call with questions. Call center operators will be available at 866-991-0648 Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 9 PM Eastern Time. Your trust is a top priority for us, and we deeply regret any inconvenience or concern that this matter may cause you.

Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Credit Card Information:

1. Review your CREDIT REPORTS. We recommend you remain vigilant for fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports. Under federal law, every 12 months you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report from each of the 3 major credit bureaus - go to: www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. Otherwise, fees may be required to be paid to the credit reporting agencies. You may stagger your requests so that you receive a free report from 1 of the 3 credit bureaus every 4 months.

2. Right to obtain/file police reports. A police report might be required to dispute fraud. You have the right to obtain and/or file a police report if you experience identity fraud. You may have to provide some proof that you were a victim of identity theft. You can report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement or to your state Attorney General, which you can find here: https://www.naag.org/find-my-ag/.

3. Place FRAUD ALERTS and obtain information about fraud alerts from the 3 credit bureaus. Place a fraud alert at 1 of the 3 major credit bureaus by phone or online; this tells creditors to follow certain procedures, e.g., contacting you, before opening any new accounts in your name or changing existing accounts. Please Note: A fraud alert can protect you but may delay you obtaining credit. To place a fraud alert, notify one of the credit bureaus and they will notify the others. You will receive confirmation letters and then can order all 3 credit reports, free of charge. An initial fraud alert lasts 1 year. Note: No one may place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

4. Place a SECURITY FREEZE. By placing a security freeze, no one will be able to use your identifying information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. Contact all 3 credit bureaus listed above to place the security freeze. Please Note: When you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you lift or permanently remove the freeze. Placing and removing credit freezes is free.

5. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.

On or about October 8, 2020, we learned that an unauthorized third-party had attacked Savory Spices computer network.

What we are doing?

Savory Spice deeply regrets that this incident occurred. After learning of the data security incident, Savory Spice engaged a third-party forensics and information technology service provider to investigate the incident. In response, we promptly implemented new security measures consistent with the third-party forensics service provider's recommendations to further enhance payment security on our website.

What you can do?

We encourage you to remain vigilant and regularly review your account statements and credit report for any incidents of fraud, identity theft, or unauthorized activity. Please review the enclosed Additional Resources section included with this letter.

The Inner City Law Center is writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps that you may consider taking.

What Happened?

We completed an investigation into suspicious activity originating from unauthorized access to an employee's email account.

You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in IDX identity protection, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the IDX website and filing a request for help.

If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069
Atlanta, GA 30348-5069
www.equifax.com

Experian Fraud Reporting
1-888-397-3742
P.O. Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013

TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

Subject: Notice of Data Security Incident
Date:

Dear StreetFire user,

We are writing to inform you that we recently discovered that some archived data from the prior streetfire.net website was acquired by an unauthorized party, including some of your information. Please review the information below.

What Happened?
On June 19, 2021, an unknown actor used what is believed to be a previously unknown technique to gain access to servers storing backup information regarding the prior streetfire.net website. Quickly after detecting the attack we took steps to remediate it, but the attacker was able to download certain files before being expelled.

What Information Was Involved?
We promptly retained leading cyber forensics firms to investigate the incident and conduct a thorough analysis of the files taken by the attacker. We learned on July 16, 2021, that the information involved included information about your account and participation on the StreetFire site including your [information not specified].

What Are We Doing?
After remediating the attack, we took steps to understand the nature and scope of the potential unauthorized access and engaged outside cybersecurity experts to investigate. We are working with these experts to assess the need for additional security measures, and we will continue to closely monitor our systems for unauthorized activity.

As an additional measure, we are offering you the option to enroll in one year of identity monitoring services from Identity Theft Guard Solutions (IDX). These services include CyberScan monitoring. If you would like to activate this coverage, please visit and use the Enrollment Code below.

IDX representatives are available Monday through Friday from 6 am to 6 pm Pacific Time. Please note the deadline to enroll is October 30, 2021.

Enrollment Code: [code not specified]

What Can Happen Next and What Can You Do?
Because your information was exposed as a result of the attack, it is possible that unauthorized third parties try to use your information. We therefore recommend that you take extra precautions to protect yourself:

Although the StreetFire website is no longer active, we recommend that you change your password on any other service on which you use the same password you most recently used on streetfire.net.

You may also receive phishing emails to the email account you used to register your account at StreetFire (the email to which we are sending this notice), so you should exercise care when receiving unexpected emails.

This incident did not affect your credit or involve information used to obtain credit. However, we are required by law to provide additional information to you in this letter regarding those issues. This information is provided below.

More Information
For the latest information on this incident, you may contact us at privacy@motortrend.com.

On behalf of MotorTrend, we regret any inconvenience this may cause you.

Sincerely,
The MotorTrend Team

Identity Theft Information
This incident did not affect your credit or involve information that can be used to obtain credit. However, the following resources can help you learn more about protecting yourself or recovering from identity theft.

You have the right to put a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report. A fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. Contacting anyone of the three credit reporting agencies will place an alert on your file at all three of them. A security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account, but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts. Credit reporting agencies cannot charge you to place a security freeze.

You will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. The agencies are not permitted to charge you for placing or lifting a freeze. Each credit reporting agency will confirm your request with a unique PIN or password that you will need in order to lift or remove the freeze. You should keep the PIN or password in a safe place.

Suspected identity theft should be reported to law enforcement, your attorney general, or the Federal Trade Commission, which also offers information about and responded to identity theft at IdentityTheft.gov. The FTC can be reached at:

On or around April 17, 2021, RSG became aware of unusual activity related to certain employee email accounts.

On April 27, 2021, we discovered that certain employee email accounts were accessed without authorization between April 4, 2021, and April 20, 2021. We could not determine whether any specific emails in those accounts were accessed or viewed. As a precaution, we conducted a programmatic and manual review of the contents of the email accounts to determine whether sensitive information was present in the emails at the time of the incident. This review was completed on June 30, 2021, and we determined that certain personal information was accessible (although not necessarily actually accessed or viewed by unauthorized individuals) within the accounts at the time of the incident.

What Information Was Involved?
It is uncertain whether information related to you was accessed or viewed during this incident. However, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution. The information related to you that was accessible within the email accounts includes your name and [BreachedElements].

What We Are Doing.
We take this incident and the security of personal information in our care seriously. Upon learning of this incident, we quickly investigated, responded, and assessed the security of relevant systems. Our response included further securing the potentially compromised accounts by resetting relevant account passwords, blocking potentially malicious IP addresses, removing any suspicious emails from RSG mailboxes, reviewing for and disabling any suspicious rules within RSG mailboxes, and opening investigations with our email solutions and managed services providers to gain further insight into the incident. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information, we are also reviewing existing policies and procedures to reduce the likelihood of a similar future incident.

A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: On July 15, 2021, the Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation and its affiliated organizations (Buddhist Tzu Chi Education Foundation and Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation) discovered that some of their computer systems were behaving abnormally. They immediately contacted local and Federal law enforcement and began working with third-party specialists to determine the source of the incident and the extent of systems affected. To the best of their knowledge, the Donation Information System was not compromised. Preliminary investigation determined that Tzu Chi was a victim of a ransomware attack. As a result, certain systems containing private and confidential information have been compromised.

Since July 15, 2021, ongoing investigations with their incidence response partners have determined that compromised data may include Social Security Numbers, Drivers License Numbers, California identification card numbers, passport numbers, military identification numbers, financial information, medical information, health insurance information, and/or information or data collected through various programs offered by them in the past. Although they have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of information at this time, they are taking steps to notify their staff, volunteers, vendors, clients, and other parties that may be impacted out of an abundance of caution.

Tzu Chi is reviewing their network security policies and taking immediate steps to further enhance its security. They take privacy and security of all information very seriously. The Foundation is also establishing a dedicated assistance line to answer questions and to provide credit monitoring services to potentially impacted individuals.

Individuals are encouraged to remain vigilant and regularly review and monitor their credit reports/account statements for suspicious activity and to detect errors. Additionally, individuals can review the below steps to protect their information and contact the dedicated assistance line to obtain enrollment information for the credit monitoring services being offered.

A fraud alert notifies anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a victim of fraud. As such, the lender should take steps to verify that you have authorized the request and deny any request that cannot be verified. A security freeze will prevent lenders and others from accessing your credit report completely.

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Should you wish to place a fraud alert or credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

This letter contains information about steps you can take to protect your information and resources we are making available to help you.

What happened:

On November 2, 2020, we discovered a data security incident that disrupted access to our network. As part of our response process, we initiated our business continuity protocols and engaged an independent computer forensic investigator to help us determine what occurred and whether any information was at risk. The forensic investigators found that an unauthorized actor gained access to certain NTS systems and files stored on our network but were unable to confirm whether the information was accessed or viewed. Out of an abundance of caution, NTS conducted a thorough review of the contents of the files. On March 17, 2021, the investigation confirmed that the impacted data included information related to certain individuals. NTS then worked to validate the data and obtain accurate contact information to process notifications. The list was finalized, and we determined that your information may have been impacted by this incident.

What information was involved:

While there is no evidence that the files were accessed or viewed, the investigation concluded that the files may have contained your first and last name, Social Security number, financial account information, and date of birth.

In addition, while we are not aware of any misuse of your information, we have arranged for you to receive credit monitoring and identity protection services at no cost to you, as a precautionary measure.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear [Name],

We are writing to inform you of a data breach incident involving the Open-source Tools for Instructional Support (OTIS) Digital Drivers License database, which is a platform used by your school.

What happened?

During a scheduled penetration test in early June 2021, we identified a vulnerability associated with our website https://otis.coe.uky.edu. We fixed the vulnerability and began an investigation with the assistance of a forensic firm. On June 25, 2021, the investigation determined that an unknown party exploited the vulnerability and likely acquired a copy of the OTIS Digital Drivers License database between January 8, 2021, and February 6, 2021.

What information was involved?

We conducted a review of the database and determined that your username (usually your email address) and password to our website were stored in the database. The database did not collect or contain any other personal information such as birthdates, social security numbers, or financial information for any user.

What We Are Doing:

For your security, we have disabled the passwords involved, and you will need to reset your password the next time you use your account. We are also taking steps to enhance the security of the database based on the results of the investigation.

What You Can Do:

At this time, we have no evidence that this information has been misused. If you use the same username and password for any other account, we recommend that you change your password there as well. You should also review the additional information on the following pages on ways to protect yourself.

For More Information:

We regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. If you have questions, please call XXX-XXX-XXXX or toll-free at XXX-XXX-XXXX, Monday-Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., EST.

Abode Services takes the privacy and protection of your personal information very seriously. Abode Services regrets any inconvenience this may cause.

Thereafter, Abode promptly began a thorough internal review to identify potentially impacted individuals whose information may have been exposed during the period of unauthorized access.

While Abode has no reason to believe that your personal information has been misused by any third parties, Abode notified you out of an abundance of caution.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [Recipient],

We are writing to inform you about a recent security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. SafetyCall provides adverse event reporting services related to consumer products for various companies, including EXTRA2. The privacy and security of the personal information we maintain is of the utmost importance to us, and we want to assure you that we are taking significant measures to protect your information.

What Happened?

Netgain, a third-party vendor that provides data hosting services to SafetyCall, experienced a network intrusion resulting in unauthorized access to certain portions of its network. Netgain first became aware of a potential security incident on November 24, 2020, which ultimately culminated in the launch of ransomware on December 3, 2020. The last day of unauthorized access on its network was December 3, 2020. Netgain reported that its environment is secure. On January 14, 2021, Netgain informed us that certain of SafetyCall's customers' data may have been taken from its network as part of the attack.

What We Are Doing.

Upon learning of the issue, we immediately obtained the records that may have been compromised and began a comprehensive review with outside data privacy professionals to determine whether any sensitive data was located within them. Our investigation concluded on EXTRA3 that the records did contain a limited amount of personal information.

What Information Was Involved?

The impacted data sets contained some of your personal information, including your name and any information you provided in relation to the product incident you reported when you called to report an issue with an EXTRA2 product, which may describe a physical injury or adverse reaction.

What You Can Do.

Protecting Your Medical Information.

- Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB), which is a statement you receive from your health insurance company after you have a medical visit. Follow up with your insurance company or care provider's billing office for any items you do not recognize. If necessary, contact the care provider on the EOB statement and ask for copies of medical records from the date of the potential access (noted above) to current date at no expense to you.
- Ask your insurance company for a current year-to-date report of all services paid for you as a beneficiary. Follow up with your insurance company or the care provider for any items you do not recognize.

Ibex Global Solutions, Inc. (Ibex) is writing to inform you of an incident that may have affected the security of your personal information. We are providing you with details of the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your personal information from possible misuse.

What Happened?

On August 17, 2020, Ibex discovered that it was the victim of a malware attack that affected a limited segment of our systems. We immediately took these systems offline and launched an investigation with the help of third-party computer specialists to determine the nature and scope of the incident. On or about September 15, 2020, the investigation confirmed that certain files on our systems may have been accessed without authorization between July 27 and August 17, 2020. We conducted a thorough review of the potentially impacted files and our internal systems to identify the information that was involved and to whom it related. On or about September 29, 2020, a third-party firm was engaged to review the potentially impacted files. On or about June 14, 2021, Ibex determined that one or more of the potentially impacted folders included information related to individuals. We continued to review and reconcile the information with internal and public records to identify the individuals to whom the data relates and the appropriate contact information for those individuals. These efforts were completed on or around July 11, 2021, at which time Ibex determined the scope of impacted individuals and the types of protected data associated with those individuals.

We worked to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible. However, there is no indication that your specific information was accessed or misused. We are notifying potentially impacted individuals out of an abundance of caution.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that the information related to you that may have been potentially affected includes your name, <<Breached Elements>>.

What We Are Doing?

Information security is among Ibex's highest priorities, and we have strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon discovering this incident, we immediately took steps to review and reinforce the security of our systems. We have implemented additional cybersecurity measures to further protect against similar incidents moving forward. We reported this incident to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.

RE: Important security notice about your Bath & Body Works account

Dear Bath & Body Works Customer,

At Bath & Body Works, we care about your privacy and the security of your personal information. That's why we are contacting you today.

What Happened?

We recently learned that an unauthorized party gained access to certain personal information in your Bath & Body Works online loyalty account between approximately June 20, 2021, and June 25, 2021. We believe that the unauthorized party capitalized on a breach of another company's system where you may have used the same login information.

What Information Was Involved?

The personal information that could have been accessed by the unauthorized party was the viewable information in your Bath & Body Works online loyalty account including, for example, name, email address, mailing address (if entered), birth day and month (not year), telephone number, loyalty account number and any gift card number and gift card PIN linked to your account via the Bath & Body Works loyalty application on your mobile device. If you have elected to save payment-card information through your account, only the last four digits of the payment card saved would have been visible. Purchases made in our stores are not impacted.

What We Are Doing

Steps we're taking:

- Promptly after learning of the issue, we took steps to secure the accounts and determine the nature of the issue.
- We are coordinating with law enforcement.
- For your protection, we've disabled your current password, and you'll need to make a new one.
- Visit the sign-in page on BathandBodyWorks.com.
- Click on "Forgot Password."
- Enter the email address associated with your account.
- A forgot-password link will be sent to your email address. If you do not immediately receive the link, please check your spam folder.
- Follow the instructions to reset your password.

Although it does not appear that the unauthorized individual was targeting reward redemptions, to prevent the unauthorized use of rewards, we are only accepting Bath & Body Works reward redemptions when the loyalty account number for an order matches the loyalty account that we have on file.

What You Can Do

Steps you should take:

- Please monitor your Bath & Body Works account for suspicious activity.
- Promptly change the username and password on all other online accounts for which you use the same or similar username and password.
- Validate the availability of any rewards and gift-card amounts that may have been linked to your account.
- Call us if you have questions or concerns, including with any gift card linked to your account. If possible, please have proof of purchase information available.

Out of an abundance of caution, we have arranged to provide potentially affected shoppers with free identity protection service for one year. You may contact us at 1-(866) 207-6311, 6 a.m. - 2 a.m. Eastern, 7 days/week, if you are interested in this option.

For More Information

In this mailing, we have included additional steps that you can take to further protect your information.

Please know we take the responsibility of protecting the confidentiality of your personal information seriously. We are very sorry that this occurred and are working diligently to maintain your trust.

Sincerely,

Customer Care Services Reference Guide

We encourage affected individuals to take the following steps:

- Register for Identity Protection Services. We have arranged to provide potentially affected shoppers with free identity protection service for one year. You may contact us at (866) 207-6311, 6 a.m. - 2 p.m. Eastern, 7 days/week, if you are interested in this option.
- Order Your Free Credit Report. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three nationwide consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit reports only through the website, toll-free number, or request form.

When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look in the inquiries section for names of creditors from whom you haven't requested credit. Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. The consumer reporting agency will be able to tell you when that is the case. Look in the personal information section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as home address and Social Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the consumer reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate consumer reporting agency by telephone and in writing. Consumer reporting agency staff will review your report with you. If the information cannot be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved. Information that cannot be explained also should be reported to your local police or sheriff's office because it may signal criminal activity.

Report Incidents. If you detect any unauthorized transactions in a financial account, promptly notify your payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud, promptly report the incident to law enforcement, the FTC, and your state Attorney General. If you believe your identity has been stolen, the FTC recommends that you take these steps:

- Close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. For streamlined checklists and sample letters to help guide you through the recovery process, please visit www.identitytheft.gov/.
- File a local police report. Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors and any others that may require proof of the identity theft crime.

You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft and how to repair identity theft:

Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer reporting agencies. For more information on fraud alerts, you also may contact the FTC as described above.

Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. You may wish to place a security freeze (also known as a credit freeze) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies without your consent. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. There is no charge to place or lift a security freeze. For more information on security freezes, you may contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies or the FTC as described above. As the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to find out more information.

The consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your request. For example, you may be asked to provide:

- Your full name with middle initial and generation (such as Jr., Sr., II, III)
- Your Social Security number
- Your date of birth
- Addresses where you have lived over the past five years
- A legible copy of a government-issued identification card (such as a state driver's license or military ID card)
- Proof of your current residential address (such as a current utility bill or account statement)

Product offers, valid dates, and participating stores subject to change without notice. Offers not valid on product purchased through third parties.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

Since the incident involved an outside party and the use of malware to encrypt the data, it is classified as a HACK type of breach.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear [First_Name] [Last_Name]:

I am writing to inform you that J.B. Poindexter & Co, Inc. experienced a ransomware attack on July 16, 2021. While there is currently no evidence that your information has been misused, we are providing you with information about the incident and additional measures you can take to protect yourself against potential misuse of your personal information.

What Happened?
On July 16, 2021, cyber criminals gained unauthorized access to various components of the J.B. Poindexter & Co, Inc. computer network, and certain servers and computers were encrypted. We took immediate action to remediate the incident and prevent future access.

What Information Was Involved?
We believe the cyber criminals may have accessed and/or removed information related to some of our current and former team members, as well as dependent(s) of our team members, if any. This information included contact information, social security number, and date of birth for the impacted team member and any dependent(s).

What We Are Doing
We value your privacy and deeply regret that this incident occurred. We conducted a thorough review of the incident, and our IT team worked diligently to restore the integrity of our network. We reported the incident to law enforcement and are cooperating with the FBI in connection with its investigation of the cyber criminals. In addition, we have implemented additional security measures designed to prevent a recurrence of such an attack and to protect the privacy of our valued team members.

To show our commitment to you, we are offering an identity theft monitoring and restoration plan for two years at no cost to all individuals potentially affected by this breach. This plan includes three bureau credit monitoring, identity monitoring, coverage for lawyers and experts up to $1 million, and many other identity theft protection services. Enclosed you will find detailed instructions on how to accept this offer and receive your LifeLock Defender Preferred plan.

Please also note that you can sign up to receive protection for family members implicated by this incident even though such family member(s) have not themselves received a letter. For minors, we have arranged for the LifeLock Junior plan.

What Can You Do?
It is possible you may receive spam email messages and/or other fraudulent communications using your contact information. We urge you to be cautious when opening links or attachments from unknown third parties. Be particularly careful if you receive emails asking for your login/password information at various financial institutions and/or from the IRS as such emails are likely fraudulent.

We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission.

Of course, it is always a good idea to change your passwords regularly. The enclosed information details LifeLock's Defender Preferred and LifeLock Junior plans and the special code needed to enroll so that the cost is borne by J.B. Poindexter & Co, Inc.

Security Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency. You may make that request by certified mail, overnight mail, regular stamped mail, or by following the instructions found at the websites listed below. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse or a minor under the age of 16, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles.

Academic HealthPlans, Inc. (AHP) is the insurance broker for the University of California and helps to administer your student health insurance plan. We are committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of all the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you about an incident involving some of your health plan information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response. To date, we do not have any evidence that indicates that your information was actually accessed or misused, but we are notifying you of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

What Happened: On July 7, 2021, we notified the University of California of an email phishing incident that targeted AHP employees and may have resulted in unauthorized access to emails and attachments in the employees email accounts. The investigation determined that two AHP employees email accounts were subject to unauthorized access as a result of the incident between the dates of August 6, 2020 and August 24, 2020, and on October 2, 2020. Although we did not find any evidence that indicates that any emails or attachments were exported from the employees email accounts or that any information was targeted or actually viewed, we could not definitively rule out that possibility. The investigation confirmed that the unauthorized access was limited to AHPs cloud-based, Microsoft Office 365 email system and did not involve AHPs enrollment waiver platform or any other AHP systems.

What Information is Involved: Subsequently, in order to determine if any emails or attachments contained personal information, we reviewed, both programmatically and manually, the information contained in the employees email accounts. Based on this review, we determined that emails or attachments in the employees email accounts contained information about you, including your name in combination with your <<b2b_text_4(Type of PHI involved for Individual)>>.

What We Are Doing: We regret any inconvenience or concern this may cause you. To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we have provided extensive training to our employees regarding phishing emails and other cybersecurity issues, and have enhanced existing security measures.

What You Can Do: We recommend that you regularly review the explanation of benefits received from your health insurer. If you see services that you did not receive, please contact the insurer immediately. As a precaution, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.

Additional Steps to Help Protect Yourself

Place a one-year fraud alert on your credit file: An initial one-year fraud alert tells anyone requesting your credit file that you might be at risk for fraud. A lender should verify that you have authorized any request to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit and/or get a new card on an existing account. If the lender can't verify this, they shouldn't process the request. Contact any one of the credit reporting agencies to set up an initial one-year fraud alert.

Place a security freeze on your credit file: A security freeze on your credit file prevents anyone from accessing your credit report and therefore from issuing credit in your name. However, placing a security freeze also may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. Contact all three of the credit reporting agencies above to set up a security freeze with each of them.

- Carry only essential documents with you.
- Be cautious about sharing your personal information with anyone else.
- Shred receipts, statements, and other documents containing sensitive information.
- Use anti-virus software on your computer and keep it updated.

What Happened.

BackNine is an insurance broker and financial services firm located in Westlake Village, California. BackNine sells life, long term care, and disability insurance as well as annuities.

On July 12, 2021, BackNine learned of a coding error that caused certain insurance and annuity applications to be uploaded to a publicly accessible folder on its cloud storage system. Upon discovery, BackNine immediately secured the folder so that it was no longer publicly accessible. BackNine also audited the cloud storage system to confirm that the folder at issue was the only one affected and altered the misconfigured code to ensure that future applications would be uploaded to and stored in the intended, non-publicly accessible folders.

In addition, BackNine, with the assistance of outside data privacy and cybersecurity experts, conducted an investigation and worked to identify the individuals whose personal information was stored in the impacted cloud storage folder and the categories of information potentially involved for each such individual. On July 26, 2021, we determined that the impacted folder contained some of your personal information. We then worked diligently to identify current address information required to provide notification of this incident. We have no reason to believe that your information was accessed, acquired, or misused. Nevertheless, we are notifying you of this issue out of an abundance of caution so that you may take appropriate steps to help protect your personal information.

What Information Was Involved.

The impacted cloud storage folder contained the following information provided by the applicant to BackNine while designating you as a <<Role/Policy Type>>: <<data elements>>.

What We Are Doing.

As soon as we learned of the issue, we took the measures referenced above. We are also implementing additional security measures to protect the information on our systems and to minimize the likelihood of a similar situation occurring in the future. Furthermore, we are providing you information about steps you can take to help protect your personal information and offering free identity protection services for <<12 or 24 months>> through IDX.

What You Can Do.

You can follow the recommendations included with this letter to protect your personal information. We also strongly encourage you to enroll in the complimentary identity protection services.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<first_name>>,

We regret to inform you that The Dixie Group, Inc. experienced a ransomware incident on April 19, 2021, which caused certain devices in our network to become unavailable. We immediately engaged a cybersecurity firm to investigate and took measures to address the incident and restore operations. We also notified law enforcement and supported their investigation.

The investigation revealed unauthorized activity on our network between April 9, 2021, and April 19, 2021, resulting in unauthorized access to folders on our file servers. Although we were unable to determine which files in these folders were accessed, we conducted a careful review of the folders and determined that some of your information was contained within them.

The information in the files included your name, Social Security number, and, if you were employed at The Dixie Group between 2005 and 2010, the financial account number you used for direct deposit. If you were among a limited number of individuals who filed workers compensation claims in connection with your employment at The Dixie Group, the files might also have contained health information related to your claim.

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com

TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com

Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.	Since the missing storage media contained personal information such as names and Social Security numbers, it was a physical data breach.

Dear EMP_SALUTATION. EMP_L_NAME:

On behalf of HM_ENTITY_2, I am writing to advise you of an ongoing investigation related to a recent security incident that may have affected the personal information stored in files for you. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of anyone's personal information. However, out of an abundance of caution, we want to make sure that everyone has access to resources that can be used to protect their personal information.

What Happened?

On July 18, 2021, encrypted files were discovered on several systems within the computer network. To the best of our knowledge, local business locations, including operating retail stores, were not affected and normal day-to-day business operations are being conducted without interruption. Furthermore, the cloud applications were not affected either.

What Is Being Done?

This matter has been reported to federal law enforcement. In addition, cybersecurity professionals have been engaged to investigate what happened and at the same time to further strengthen the security of all systems within the computer network.

What Information Was Available?

An investigation is ongoing to determine which information may have been involved. Since it is possible that HM_ENTITY_2's corporate file server containing personal identifying information (including names, birth dates, and social security numbers) may have been accessed, you are being notified through this letter.

What You Can Do

In order to ensure that all HM_ENTITY_2 employees have the right resources at their disposal to protect themselves, a two-year credit monitoring and identity protection service from Experian has been purchased for you. This service is at no charge to you. To enroll, please follow the instructions included with this letter. An Identity Protection Reference Guide which includes additional resources on how to prevent identity theft is included with this letter and we strongly encourage you to review this information. It offers some helpful tips on how to monitor the use of your personal information.

Please know that we are working very hard to address this situation. We would also ask that you refrain from talking about this matter with anyone outside of the company. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you and thank you for your support and understanding. If you have any questions, please reach out to our dedicated assistance team at [insert call center number], [insert call center days and times].

Sincerely,

IDENTITY PROTECTION REFERENCE GUIDE

1. Review your Credit Reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by monitoring your credit reports for any activity you do not recognize. Under federal law, you are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To order your free annual credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at (877) 322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) website at www.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three credit bureaus provide free annual credit reports only through the website, toll-free number, or request form. If you see anything in your credit report that you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone number on the report. You should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in writing.

2. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. You can learn more about fraud alerts by contacting the credit bureaus or by visiting their websites:

Equifax Fraud Reporting

P.O. Box 740241

TransUnion Fraud Reporting

P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is only necessary to contact one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You should receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.

3. Place Security Freezes. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personally identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. Federal and state laws prohibit charges for placing, temporarily lifting, or removing a security freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. To place a security freeze, you must contact each of the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above and provide the following information: (1) your full name; (2) your Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) the addresses where you have lived over the past two years; (5) proof of current address, such as a utility bill or telephone bill; (6) a copy of a government-issued identification card; and (7) if you are the victim of identity theft, include the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency. If the request to place a security freeze is made by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, the credit bureaus have one business day after receiving your request to place the security freeze on your credit report. If the	The language used in the data breach notification letter suggests that encrypted files were discovered on several systems within the computer network, indicating that the breach involved hacking or malware. The letter also notes that the matter has been reported to federal law enforcement and that cybersecurity professionals have been engaged to investigate the incident and further strengthen security.

Monitor Your Accounts

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report. Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumers credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumers credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumers identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below. As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumers express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
Social Security number;
Date of birth;
Addresses for the prior two to five years;
Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state drivers license or ID card, etc.); and
A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Pendrick Capital Partner Holdings LLC (Pendrick) is informing you of a recent incident that may affect some of your information. Pendrick acquires medical debt and receives information from entities as part of its normal business operations. We are providing you with notice of the incident, steps we are taking in response, and resources available to help protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On or about May 14, 2021, Pendrick discovered suspicious activity relating to an employee's email account. We immediately took steps to secure the account and launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. This investigation confirmed access to certain employee email accounts on separate occasions between April 12, 2021, to May 14, 2021. While the investigation was able to determine the email accounts were accessed, it was unable to determine whether any specific email or attachment within the impacted email accounts was actually accessed by the unauthorized individual. As part of our investigation, on or about June 8, 2021, an initial review of the impacted accounts determined they may contain information related to certain Pendrick customers. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, we conducted a comprehensive review of the impacted email accounts to identify emails or attachments that contain protected information.

What Information Was Involved?

On or about June 25, 2021, this review was completed, and we immediately began a review of the results to identify address information for the individuals whose information may have been affected and to determine which Pendrick customer the individuals belonged. This additional review was completed on or about July 21, 2021, and we then worked to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible. The information potentially impacted includes your name, [Extra1][Extra3]. To date, Pendrick has no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information.

What We Are Doing?

Pendrick takes the confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our possession very seriously. As part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy and security of personal information in our care, we are reviewing our existing policies and procedures relating to data protection and security. We are also investigating additional security measures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. In addition to notifying you, we are also notifying state regulators, where required.

What You Can Do?

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account statements, monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity, and to detect errors. Additionally, we are offering you access to complimentary credit monitoring services for [Extra2] months through Experian. You can find out more about how to safeguard your information in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

At San Andreas Regional Center, we value transparency and respect the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to let you know about a data breach that may involve some of your personal information, what we did in response, and steps you can take to help protect yourself against possible misuse of your personal information.

What Happened

On July 5, 2021, we discovered that we were the victim of a sophisticated ransomware attack that impacted our networks and servers. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity's network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity's files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity's files.

After discovering the incident, we quickly took steps to secure and safely restore our systems and operations. Further, we immediately engaged outside counsel and third-party forensic experts to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident's nature and scope, assist in the remediation efforts, and contacted and filed a report with the FBI. We concluded our initial investigation on August 2, 2021, and determined that an unauthorized individual encrypted some of our systems that contained your information. Further, the unauthorized individual acquired some of the information contained on our servers, but we cannot confirm if the information obtained by the unauthorized individual included your information.

However, as of now, we have no evidence indicating misuse of any of your information, but we wanted to notify you of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

What Information Was Involved

The types of information potentially involved are your first and last name, address, date of birth, telephone numbers, Social Security number, email address, health plan beneficiary number, health insurance information, full-face photos, and/or comparable images, UCI (unique identifying number or code generated by us for you), medical information, diagnosis, disability codes, and other certificate/license numbers.

What We Are Doing

As explained above, we took immediate steps to secure our systems, filed a report with the FBI, and engaged third-party forensic experts to assist in the investigation. Further, in response to this incident, we are implementing cybersecurity safeguards, enhancing our employee cybersecurity training, and improving our cybersecurity policies, procedures, and protocols to help minimize the likelihood of this type of incident occurring again.

What You Can Do

The security and privacy of the information contained within our systems are a top priority for us. Therefore, while we have no evidence indicating your information was misused, we strongly recommend you remain vigilant, monitor and review all of your financial and account statements, and report any unusual activity to the institution that issued the record and law enforcement.

What Happened?

We have conducted an investigation involving unauthorized access to a small number of our employees' email accounts.

Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

If your health information was involved, we also recommend that you review any statements that you receive relating to your health insurance. If you identify any services that you did not receive, please notify your healthcare provider immediately.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it	The breach involved unauthorized access to the email accounts of a small number of employees due to hacking by an unauthorized person.

We are writing to inform you of a recent event that may impact some of your information. Although we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we are providing you with details about the event, steps we are taking in response, and resources available to help you better protect your information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On September 16, 2020, we detected suspicious activity on certain systems on the Syufy network. We immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. Through the investigation, we identified certain files and folders on the network that may have been viewed or taken by an unauthorized actor between September 7, 2020, and September 15, 2020. Although the investigation could not definitively confirm whether an unauthorized actor viewed or took such files, in an abundance of caution, we conducted a thorough review of the potentially impacted files to determine whether they contained any sensitive information. This review was completed on or about March 1, 2021. We thereafter worked to identify address information in order to notify potentially impacted individuals, which we have now completed.

What Information Was Involved?

We cannot confirm if the unauthorized actor(s) viewed or took any specific information relating to you. However, we determined that the potentially at-risk files contained your name, [data elements].

What We Are Doing.

We took steps to contain the incident, including resetting user passwords promptly upon discovery. As part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy and security of information in our care, we are evaluating opportunities to improve security and to better prevent future events of this kind. We have secured the services of IDX to provide you with credit monitoring and identity restoration services for 12 months, at no cost to you.

What You Can Do.

As a precaution, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account statements and by monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. You can find out more about how to better protect against the potential misuse of information in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information.

Monitor Your Accounts

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a one-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a credit freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

You may further educate yourself regarding identity theft, fraud alerts, credit freezes, and the steps you can take to protect your personal information by contacting the consumer reporting bureaus, the Federal Trade Commission, or your state Attorney General. The Federal Trade Commission may be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580; www.identitytheft.gov; 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); and TTY: 1-866-653-4261. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. You can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. Please note that in order to file a report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some proof that you have been a victim. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should also be reported to law enforcement and your state Attorney General.

This notice has not been delayed by law enforcement.	There was suspicious activity on Syufy Enterprises LP's network, files and folders were targeted, and there is no confirmation if the unauthorized actor viewed or took any specific information relating to the individuals' data.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [Recipient],

We are writing to inform you of a recent security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. SafetyCall takes the privacy and security of the personal information we maintain very seriously. We provide adverse event reporting services related to consumer products for various companies, including EXTRA2.

The incident occurred at a third-party vendor, Netgain, which provides data hosting services to SafetyCall. Netgain informed us that it experienced a network intrusion resulting in unauthorized access to certain portions of its network. Netgain first became aware of a potential security incident on November 24, 2020, which ultimately culminated in the launch of ransomware on December 3, 2020. The last day of unauthorized access on its network was December 3, 2020. Netgain reported that its environment is secure.

On January 14, 2021, Netgain informed us that certain of SafetyCall's customers' data may have been taken from its network as part of the attack. Upon learning of the issue, we immediately obtained the records that may have been compromised and began a comprehensive review with outside data privacy professionals to determine whether any sensitive data was located within them. Our investigation concluded on EXTRA3 that the records did contain a limited amount of personal information.

The impacted data sets contained some of your personal information, including your name and any information you provided in relation to the product incident you reported when you called to report an issue with an EXTRA2 product, which may describe a physical injury or adverse reaction.

We have no information to date indicating that your information involved in this incident was or will be used for any unintended purposes. To the extent it is helpful, this letter provides precautionary measures you can take to protect your personal information.

Please accept our apologies that this incident occurred. We are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information and have taken many precautions to safeguard it. We continually evaluate and modify our practices and internal controls to enhance the security and privacy of your personal information.

If you have any further questions regarding this incident, please call our dedicated and confidential toll-free response line that we have set up to respond to questions. The response line is staffed with professionals familiar with this incident and knowledgeable on what you can do if you are concerned about potential misuse of your information. The response line is available Monday through Friday from 9 am to 11 pm Eastern Time, or Saturday and Sunday from 11 am to 8 pm Eastern Time. Be prepared to provide your engagement number.

We have no information to date indicating that your information involved in this incident was or will be used for any unintended purposes. As a general matter, however, the following practices can help to protect you from medical identity theft:

- Only share your health insurance cards with your health care providers and other family members who are covered under your insurance plan or who help you with your medical care.
- Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) which is a statement you receive from your health insurance company after you have a medical visit. Follow up with your insurance company or care provider's billing office for any items you do not recognize. If necessary, contact the care provider on the EOB statement and ask for copies of medical records from the date of the potential access (noted above) to current date at no expense to you.
- Ask your insurance company for a current year-to-date report of all services paid for you as a beneficiary. Follow up with your insurance company or the care provider for any items you do not recognize.

Sincerely,

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

At San Andreas Regional Center, we value transparency and respect the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to let you know about a data breach that may involve some of your personal information, what we did in response, and steps you can take to help protect yourself against possible misuse of your personal information.

What Happened

On July 5, 2021, we discovered that we were the victim of a sophisticated ransomware attack that impacted our networks and servers. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity's network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity's files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity's files. After discovering the incident, we quickly took steps to secure and safely restore our systems and operations. Further, we immediately engaged outside counsel and third-party forensic experts to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident's nature and scope, assist in the remediation efforts, and contacted and filed a report with the FBI. We concluded our initial investigation on August 2, 2021, and determined that an unauthorized individual encrypted some of our systems that contained your information. Further, the unauthorized individual acquired some of the information contained on our servers, but we cannot confirm if the information obtained by the unauthorized individual included your information.

However, as of now, we have no evidence indicating misuse of any of your information, but we wanted to notify you of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

What Information Was Involved

The types of information potentially involved are your first and last name, address, date of birth, telephone numbers, Social Security number, email address, health plan beneficiary number, health insurance information, full-face photos, and or comparable images, UCI (unique identifying number or code generated by us for you), medical information, diagnosis, disability codes, and other certificate/license numbers.

What We Are Doing

As explained above, we took immediate steps to secure our systems, filed a report with the FBI, and engaged third-party forensic experts to assist in the investigation. Further, in response to this incident, we are implementing cybersecurity safeguards, enhancing our employee cybersecurity training, and improving our cybersecurity policies, procedures, and protocols to help minimize the likelihood of this type of incident occurring again.

What You Can Do

The security and privacy of the information contained within our systems are a top priority for us. Therefore, while we have no evidence indicating your information was misused, we strongly recommend you remain vigilant, monitor and review all of your financial and account statements, and report any unusual activity to the institution that issued the record and law enforcement.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<first_name>> <<last_name>>,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that affected SAC Wireless. As a result of this incident, the security of some of your personal information may have been compromised.

WHAT HAPPENED

On June 16, 2021, SAC Wireless became aware that certain aspects of our internal technology infrastructure may have been accessed by an unauthorized third-party as part of a ransomware attack. Upon learning of the incident, we promptly deployed multiple security tools and infrastructure enhancements to contain the incident. We then contacted the FBI and engaged external counsel and cyber security experts to better understand the scope of the incident and determine what, if any, personal information was compromised. The forensic investigation was materially completed on August 13, 2021. Based on the forensic analysis, we believe that our infrastructure may have been accessed as early as April 13, 2021. The threat actor, Conti, gained access to the SAC systems, uploaded files to its cloud storage, and then, on June 16, deployed ransomware to encrypt the files on SAC systems.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED

Our internal review of potentially impacted personal information is ongoing, but we believe that the files affected by this incident could have possibly contained some or all of the following categories of personal information relating to current and former SAC Wireless employees: name, date of birth, contact information (such as home address, email, and phone), government ID numbers (such as drivers license, passport, or military ID), social security number, citizenship status, work information (such as title, salary, and evaluations), medical history, health insurance policy information, license plate numbers, digital signatures, certificates of marriage or birth, tax return information, and dependent/beneficiary names. To the extent that one of your dependents or beneficiaries was included on an SAC Wireless health plan, their personal information may also have been compromised. While this list of personal information has been identified as part of the data set potentially compromised in this incident, it does not mean that each category of personal information listed was compromised for every individual.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

We have been working and will continue to work with our cyber and forensic experts to remedy this incident and to identify potential enhancements to our information security systems. In response to this ransomware attack, we have already changed firewall rules, disconnected VPN connections, activated conditional access geo-location policies to limit non-U.S. access, provided additional employee training, deployed additional network and endpoint monitoring tools, expanded multi-factor authentication, and deployed additional threat-hunting and endpoint detection and response tools. We will deploy additional new measures in the coming months, and we continue to assess and monitor new threats and security vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis.

As part of protecting your online identity and safety, we have engaged Experian to offer you a free 24-month membership to their identity protection services. Please refer to Appendix A for details on the services provided and how you can enroll for free.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

In addition to enrolling for free in Experian's identity protection services (see Appendix A for details), we recommend you take the following precautions:

Security Freeze

You can place a security freeze on your credit report, which may help prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing or other services. It is free to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency (see contact info below). Depending on the agency, you may be asked to provide some or all of the following information when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse or a minor under the age of 16, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security Number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. You may also need to include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. You may obtain a free security freeze by contacting one or more of the following national credit reporting agencies:

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

Healthpointe Medical Group, Inc. (Healthpointe) is providing notice of a recent data incident that may affect the security of certain sensitive personal information. While we have no evidence that your information has been used to commit identity theft or fraud, we are writing out of an abundance of caution to provide you with steps you can take to better protect yourself against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

Mater Dei High School (Mater Dei) is writing to inform you of a recent cybersecurity incident that may have resulted in an unauthorized access of some of your sensitive personal information. While we are unaware of any misuse of your personal information at this time, we are providing you with details about the event, steps we are taking in response, and free resources available to help you protect your information.

What Happened?

In late January 2021, Mater Dei became aware of suspicious logins into some of its employees' email accounts likely due to a response to a phishing email message with a malicious link. Upon discovery of this incident, Mater Dei engaged cyber counsel and a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. The forensic investigation confirmed that two of Mater Dei employees' accounts had unauthorized access from January 1, 2021, to March 4, 2021, where information could have been viewed or exfiltrated. Once the unauthorized access was confirmed, Mater Dei promptly engaged a third-party vendor to review all the files and emails within the compromised email accounts to identify the potentially impacted individuals whose information may have been exposed during the period of unauthorized access. This investigation concluded early June 2021, and it determined that your personal information was within one of the compromised accounts. Since then, Mater Dei has been working internally to identify the addresses for these individuals to send you this notice. At this time, Mater Dei has no reason to believe your personal information has been misused by any third parties. However, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to inform you of this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

The types of information involved varied by individual, and very few individuals had every field of data impacted. However, the information potentially exposed during the unauthorized access may have included your name, address, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, credit card number with security code and expiration date, Identity Protection PIN, full access credentials to FACTS, and/or protected health information, including but not limited to diagnosis, treatment and prescription information, provider name, patient ID, Medicare/Medicaid number, health insurance information, and treatment cost.

What We Are Doing

Mater Dei is committed to ensuring the security of all personal information in our control. As mentioned above, upon discovery of this incident, we engaged cyber counsel and a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. We also changed all email passwords, improved our computer security settings, and new policies were implemented to reduce the storage of sensitive personal information within our email systems. Additionally, we are providing you with guidance on how to help protect against the possibility of information misuse. Our objective is to always help protect your personal information, and to assist to that end, we are providing you with 12 months of complimentary identity monitoring services through Kroll. While we are covering the cost of these services, you will need to complete the activation process by following the instructions included in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information.

Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name:

This letter is to inform you of an Incident that may have involved your personal information. Although the Department has no evidence of actual or attempted malicious use of your information, this letter provides details about what happened, our investigation, and steps you can take in response.

What happened? On July 14, 2021, we learned a County employee created a website that was intended to be used by County Fire EMS Bureau staff to obtain proof of COVID vaccinations administered by the County Fire Department (the Incident). A link to the website was made available to County personnel on or about July 13, 2021. Access to the website allowed certain information to be visible to unauthorized users. Upon discovering the Incident, the website was immediately taken down and the County began an investigation. We are unaware of any use of your information for any malicious or other illegal purpose.

Our investigation is ongoing, and we may discover additional or different information once the investigation is concluded. If this is the case, we will provide you further notice.

What Information Was Involved? Based on our preliminary investigation, the Incident involved personal information including your first and last name, date of birth, and that you declined to be vaccinated. Although this information is not medical information under California law, we nevertheless wanted to provide you notice of this Incident.

What We Are Doing We are committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your information. On the day we learned of this Incident, the website was disabled and the personal information was no longer publicly accessible. We also began investigating this Incident to understand the full scope of personal information involved.

Our internal information security team has put in place additional safeguards to restrict access to databases containing your COVID vaccination data. As part of our ongoing operations, we will continue to review security policies and procedures and implement changes when needed to enhance our information security controls.

What You Can Do To protect against the possibility of identity theft or other financial loss, we encourage you to remain vigilant to review your account statements and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Again, we have no evidence to suggest that your personal information has been fraudulently used or compromised, but want to offer this information to enable you to protect yourself. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free, 1-877-322-8228.

You can further educate yourself about identity theft and the steps you can take to protect yourself by contacting the Federal Trade Commission at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, www.identitytheft.gov; 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); and TTY 1-866-653-4261.

Notice of Data Security Incident

To <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have affected your personal information.

What happened?

On March 10, 2021, MFA Financial, Inc. (MFA) suffered a cybersecurity incident in its legacy environment. Upon discovery, we took immediate steps to contain the threat and engaged a third-party forensics firm to investigate the incident and assist with remediation efforts. We also notified federal law enforcement authorities of the incident.

Our investigation has found that, between February 12, 2021 and March 10, 2021, the unauthorized party was able to access and remove data from a file server in our legacy environment, which contained personal information pertaining to certain MFA employees and contractors.

What information may have been involved?

As a result of our ongoing investigation, on August 2, 2021, we were able to determine that your personal information may have been involved. The personal information may have included: name, address and Social Security number.

What we are doing.

MFA takes the security of personal information very seriously. As soon as we discovered the incident, we promptly launched a forensic investigation, contacted law enforcement, and took steps to remediate the incident. In response to this incident, we have enhanced our security and monitoring and taken other measures to minimize the risk of a similar incident in the future. We have arranged to offer you credit monitoring, identity theft protection, and Dark Web monitoring services for a period of two years, at no cost to you, through IDX. You have until December 1, 2021 to activate these services, and instructions on how to activate these services are included in the attached Reference Guide.

What you can do.

In addition to signing up for your complimentary credit monitoring, the enclosed Reference Guide includes additional information on general steps you can take to monitor and protect your personal information. We encourage you to carefully review credit reports and account statements to ensure that all of your account activity is valid. Any questionable charges should be promptly reported to the company with which the account is maintained.

For more information

If you have any questions about this matter or would like additional information, please refer to the enclosed Reference Guide, visit https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect, or call toll-free 833-664-1799. The call center is open from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM Eastern time, Monday through Friday, except holidays.

We regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused you.

Sincerely,

Harold E. Schwartz
Senior Vice President & Secretary

Reference Guide

Review Your Account Statements

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained.

Order Your Free Credit Report

To order your free annual credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at (877) 322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commissions (FTC) website at www.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three credit bureaus provide free annual credit reports only through the website, toll-free number or request form. Upon receiving your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look in the inquiries section for names of creditors from whom you have not requested credit. Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names; the credit bureau will be able to tell if this is the case. Look in the personal information section for any inaccuracies in information (such as home address and Social Security Number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone number on the report. Errors may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in writing. Information that cannot be explained should also be reported to your local police or sheriffs office because it may signal criminal activity.

How to Enroll in IDX Credit Monitoring Protection

As a safeguard, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service for two years provided by IDX. To enroll in this service, please call 833-664-1799 or visit https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using Enrollment Code: [ENROLLMENT CODE] The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, IDX will be able to assist you. We encourage you to take advantage of these protections and remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft, including regularly reviewing and monitoring your credit reports and account statements.

Contact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission

If you detect any unauthorized transactions in any of your financial accounts, promptly notify the appropriate payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incidents of identity theft or fraud, promptly report the matter to your local law enforcement authorities, state Attorney General and the FTC. You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft by using the contact information below:

Place a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File

To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a credit grantor checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the credit grantor gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the credit grantor to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free fraud numbers provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows flagging of your file with a fraud alert at all three credit bureaus.

Security Freezes

You have the right to request a credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit bureau. To place a security freeze on your credit report you must contact the credit reporting agency by phone, mail, or secure electronic means and provide proper identification of your identity. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. Below, please find relevant contact information	The breach was caused by an unauthorized party who was able to access and remove data from a file server. A forensic investigation was launched, and a third-party forensics firm assisted with remediation efforts.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<Name 1>>,

As CEO of DuPage Medical Group, Ltd. (DMG), I am writing to inform you of a security incident that may have affected the security of some of your information. On July 13, 2021, we experienced a security incident that caused a disruption to our network systems. We immediately began working with third-party cyber-forensic specialists to investigate the incident and determine its nature and scope. It was discovered that unauthorized actors gained access to the DMG network between July 12, 2021, and July 13, 2021, causing the network outage. Through the investigation, we found that certain systems containing information related to patients may have been impacted by this event. On August 17, 2021, we determined that certain files stored within our environment that contained your information may have been impacted by this event.

The personal information that may have been affected includes your name, address, date of birth, diagnosis code, CPT code, and treatment date. However, we have no evidence that any information has been subject to actual or attempted misuse as a result of this incident. We can confirm that this event did not impact your financial account numbers or Social Security number.

Information security is among DMG's highest priorities, and we have security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon becoming aware of this incident, we immediately took steps to confirm the security of our systems. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information, we are reviewing existing security policies and have implemented additional cybersecurity measures to further protect against similar incidents from occurring in the future. In addition, we notified law enforcement and are supporting their investigation into this incident.

We are notifying potentially impacted individuals, including you, so that you may take steps to best protect your information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so. We are also reporting this incident to regulatory officials, as required. A special call center has been established by DMG to help answer questions about this incident.

As an added precaution, we are offering you access to credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 12 months at no cost to you, through Equifax.

Dear [Recipient],

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have impacted some of your personal information. We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any concern this incident may cause. This letter contains information about what happened, actions we have taken to prevent a reoccurrence, and steps you can take to protect your information.

What happened?

Sequoia Financial Services provides account receivable services for several agencies. On July 2, 2021, we discovered that we were the target of a ransomware attack. Ransomware is a computer virus that encrypts computer systems until and unless money (i.e., the ransom) demanded by the attackers is paid. The attacker gained access on June 28th and launched the attack on July 1st. The attack was blocked by anti-malware software within minutes, and we were able to restore our computers without paying the attackers. These rampant attacks continue to challenge everyone in the business and medical communities.

What information was involved?

We believe it is likely the attacker only wanted money and not the information on our computers, but the encrypted system may have contained some of your personal information. The following personal information may have been compromised: your name, address, date of birth, insurance policy number, and limited health (such as diagnosis codes) and insurance information related to your treatment. If you would like more information about specific information that was identified, you can request that information by calling the number below.

What we are doing.

We take the security of your information seriously and have taken measures to reduce the likelihood of future cyber-attacks, including increasing our hardware and software defenses against these rampant attacks. We are also working with law enforcement and Experian, a major credit reporting agency, to address this data security incident.

What You Can Do.

While we have no evidence of misuse of your personal information, in an abundance of caution, we are offering a complimentary 24-month membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM. This product provides you with superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft.

Dear Mr.,

Notice of Data Breach

What Happened?
We are writing to inform you about a recent privacy incident that was discovered on or around August 12, 2021, at the Department of State Hospitals Coalinga (DSH-C). An employee of DSH-C had been providing patient rosters to the United States District Court, Eastern District of California (the District Court) at the request of the District Court. The purpose of this was to determine whether patients were eligible for a waiver of their filing fees when filing a lawsuit. Although the roster contained more information than was needed, including information regarding patients who never filed any lawsuits, there is no evidence that the information on the roster was used for any purpose apart from the District Court Clerk making an eligibility determination for a public benefit provided by the Court.

What information was involved?
The DSH-C roster provided to the District Court contained your name, case number, birth date, legal commitment, admission date, unit number, and gender. The information did not contain other information, such as your Social Security number, Drivers License number, or financial account numbers which could expose you to identity theft.

What we are doing:

Enclosures:
- Breach Help Consumer Tips from the California Attorney General;
- DSH 6406 Request for Patients Records
- Frequently Asked Questions	The breach was caused by an employee of DSH-C who provided patient rosters to District Court, which contained more information than was needed. However, there is no evidence that the information on the roster was used for any purpose apart from the District Court Clerk making eligibility determination for a public benefit provided by the court. The information disclosed did not contain other information, such as social security number or drivers license number, but compromising patient rosters should still be considered a data breach.

AE3781 v.03

Dear <<Name 1>>,

K and B Surgical Center, LLC (K&B) is writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have resulted in an unauthorized access of your sensitive personal information. While we are unaware of any misuse of your personal information at this time, we are providing you with details about the event, steps we are taking in response, and free resources available to help you protect your information.

What Happened?

On March 30, 2021, K&B discovered that an unauthorized user had gained access to its network. Upon discovery of this incident, K&B promptly engaged a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. On April 27, 2021, the forensic investigation determined that an unauthorized user accessed K&Bs systems from March 24, 2021 to March 30, 2021. Then K&B performed data mining on the affected servers to identify the specific individuals and the types of information that may have been compromised, and on July 27, 2021, K&B finalized the list of individuals to notify. At this time, K&B has no reason to believe your personal information has been misused by any third parties. However, out of an abundance of caution, K&B wanted to inform you of this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

The types of information involved varied by individual. However, the information potentially exposed during the unauthorized access may have included your name, date of birth, and other data elements.

What We Are Doing

K&B is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of all personal information in our care. Since the discovery of the incident, K&B have taken and will continue to take steps to mitigate the risk of future issues. Specifically, K&B engaged a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. K&B also changed passwords for all user accounts, VPN connections, and emails, installed new anti-virus security systems and threat monitoring programs on all computers, implemented periodic network security audits, re-trained employees on security, and updated the security rule risk analysis. Additionally, K&B is providing you with guidance on how to help protect against the possibility of information misuse.

Furthermore, K&B is providing you with 12 months of complimentary identity monitoring services through Equifax. While K&B is covering the cost of these services, you will need to complete the activation process by following the instructions included in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information.

What You Can Do

K&B encourages you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious or unauthorized activity. Additionally, security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus to inform them of such a breach and take the recommended steps to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file. Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take	Based on the description of the incident, an unauthorized user gained access to K&B's network and the company engaged a specialized cybersecurity firm to investigate the nature and scope of the incident. Therefore, it is most likely a hack.
Insufficient information	There is not enough information available to determine the type of breach.

We immediately contacted law enforcement and filed a police report, but the laptop bag and its contents have not been recovered.

What information was involved?

From our investigation, it appears that your protected health information was present on the laptop. This information includes your name, address, date of birth, provider name, date of service, diagnosis and treatment information, health insurance information, and other information related to your medical care.

Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your IDX identity protection membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, IDX will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact IDX at 1-833-992-4006 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in IDX identity protection, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the IDX website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop, and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus

Equifax Fraud Reporting

1-866-349-5191

P.O. Box 105069

Atlanta, GA 30348-5069

www.equifax.com

Experian Fraud Reporting

1-888-397-3742

TransUnion Fraud Reporting

1-800-680-7289

P.O. Box 2000

Chester, PA 19022-2000

www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>>,

We are writing to inform you about a potential data security incident that may have impacted your personal information. The privacy and security of your personal information is of utmost importance to us, and we are taking steps to help protect your personal information.

On February 22, 2021, we learned about a potential data security incident and immediately began an investigation. As a precautionary measure, we took our website payment page offline and engaged an independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and to confirm whether any personal information was impacted by the incident. The lengthy and extensive investigation did not find any evidence of compromise of our environment. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing you with notification about this possible incident.

While there is no indication that our environment was compromised, the potential incident may have impacted the following information: your name, address, payment card number, expiration date, and payment card security code.

As soon as we discovered that there may have been an incident, we took the steps described above. Also, out of an abundance of caution, we have migrated our online payment page to a new platform with additional security measures and have taken steps to ensure it is safe and secure for all purchases. We are also providing you with this notice and information about steps you can take to help protect your personal information.

We recommend that you review the guidance included with this letter about how to protect your personal information and remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. For this reason, we are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident.

What happened?

In late July, a title company used as a vendor for some loan transactions by Nations Lending was a victim of a ransomware attack that froze the data in their systems and made it inaccessible. The company has been restoring its systems through the use of backup and redundant measures, but they have not ruled out the possibility that the individuals whose malware caused the incident were able to access information from the system. Nations Lending received notice from the company a few weeks later and launched its inquiry to attempt to determine which of our customers' information might be at risk.

What information was involved?

Information from the closing package for your loan, including documents bearing your name, address, Social Security number, email, account financial information, and information about your assets.

What we are doing.

We suspended any further transactions with the vendor and moved pending closings to our other service providers. The vendor is reviewing their security practices and controls and upgrading their security systems. Before we resume any business transactions with this vendor, they will have to pass a complete cybersecurity evaluation and demonstrate that their systems and personnel are hardened against any further attacks. We are also requiring a review of their data storage policies to minimize how long your information remains in their systems.

To help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

I am writing to inform you about a data security incident that occurred at Carpenter Co. (Carpenter or the Company). On March 18, 2021, Carpenter experienced a ransomware incident that impacted the Company's information technology systems, including its operating, network, and email software systems. The Company did not pay the ransom and immediately began working to contain the incident and terminate any unauthorized access. At the time, due to the systems impacted, it was unclear if any personally identifiable information had been impacted by this incident. However, in the course of the Company's subsequent investigation into the incident, our outside forensic expert confirmed on May 24, 2021, that the threat actor did gain access to certain of our employees and contractors' personal information (although we cannot determine whether the threat actor actually viewed or used your personal information).

This notice was not delayed as the result of a law enforcement investigation.

This incident involved your <<b2b_text_2(Impacted Data)>>. As a result, your personal information may have been exposed to others. While we do not know whether your personal information was in fact used for any unauthorized purpose, we are sending you this notice out of an abundance of caution.

We have taken numerous actions to mitigate the incident, including notifying law enforcement, successfully locking out the unauthorized users from the Company's system, successfully containing and removing the malware from the Company's system, undertaking a full forensic investigation of the incident with the assistance of an outside forensics investigation firm, and conducting a comprehensive information security assessment. The Company has also taken steps to enhance the security protections on the Company's systems since the incident, including adding network monitoring at internet egress points and implementing active directory hardening measures.

To help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for 12 months. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [Recipient],

We are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have resulted in unauthorized access to some of our customers' payment card data used on our website, www.dickblick.com. At Dick Blick Holdings, Inc. (Dick Blick Holdings), we take the privacy and security of your personal information seriously and are continuously evaluating and improving our security and payment systems to ensure your information is secure.

What Happened?

We recently discovered that our website, www.dickblick.com, which is used for online purchases, was modified by a bad actor with malicious code that captured certain payment card data as it was entered on the website by customers in connection with a purchase. We immediately engaged external forensic investigators and data privacy professionals and commenced a prompt and thorough investigation into the incident. As a result of this review, we determined that the payment card information that potentially may have been accessed was information related to transactions between March 11, 2020, and December 15, 2020, made on our website, www.dickblick.com.

What Information Was Involved?

The information that may have been acquired in this incident included customer name, credit or debit card numbers (payment cards), CVVs (3 or 4-digit code on the front or back of the payment card), and payment card expiration dates. We discovered on August 10, 2021, that you completed a transaction at our website, www.dickblick.com, between March 11, 2020, and December 15, 2020, with your payment card ending in [last four digits], and your payment card information may be at risk. No other personal information of yours was affected because of this incident. Your payment card company is already aware of the potential risk to your payment card and may have already closed your account and reissued you a new payment card.

What We Are Doing

Because we value our relationship with you, we wanted to make you aware of the incident. We also wanted to let you know what we are doing to further secure your information and suggest steps you can take to protect your information. Since learning of the incident, we have implemented enhanced security safeguards to help protect against similar intrusions. We are also conducting ongoing monitoring of our website, www.dickblick.com, to ensure that it is secure from any malicious activity.

What You Can Do

As a best practice, you should call your bank or payment card issuer if you see any suspicious transactions. The policies of the payment card brands, such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover, provide that you are not liable for any unauthorized charges if you report them in a timely manner. You should also ask your bank or payment card issuer whether a new card should be issued to you if it has not been already. Below you will find precautionary measures you can take to protect your personal information. Additionally, you should always remain vigilant by reviewing your financial account statements for fraudulent or irregular activity on a regular basis and monitoring free credit reports.

For More Information

Your trust is a top priority for Dick Blick Holdings, and we deeply regret the inconvenience this may have caused. The privacy and protection of our customers' information is a matter we take seriously. If you have any further questions regarding this incident, please call our dedicated and confidential toll-free response line to respond to questions at [phone number]. This response line is staffed with professionals familiar with this incident and knowledgeable on what you can do to protect against misuse of your information. The response line is available Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

2. Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File. If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a Security Freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:

Equifax Security Freeze
PO Box 105788
Atlanta, GA 30348
https://www.freeze.equifax.com
1-800-349-9960

Experian Security Freeze
PO Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013

TransUnion Security Freeze
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19016
http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze
1-888-909-8872

To place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique personal identification number (PIN) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report with your local law enforcement agency.

3. Obtaining a Free Credit Report. Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

4. Additional Helpful Resources. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many creditors will want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by contacting them on the internet at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338), or by mail at Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. In addition, you may obtain information from the FTC about fraud alerts and security freezes.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Dick Blick Holdings, Inc.

That is why we are notifying you of the incident, offering you identity monitoring services, and informing you about steps you can take to help protect your information.

What Happened?

On September 2, 2020, HCI became aware of a possible data security incident involving our computer network. We immediately conducted an investigation and hired independent computer forensic investigators to help determine what happened. The investigation determined that we had experienced a malware attack in which an unauthorized person gained access to, viewed and acquired certain files stored on our network. We then hired a third party vendor to conduct a thorough review of the impacted information. That review determined that the personal information of our current and former employees may have been accessed by the unauthorized person. We then took steps to obtain your current address and notify you of this incident. We have no information at this time that your information has been misused.

What Information Was Involved?

The information potentially impacted includes your name and <<variable data>>.

What Are We Doing?

As soon as we discovered the incident, we took the steps described above.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state. Contact information for the FTC is: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20580, www.consumer.ftc.gov or www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-438-4338.

RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Metabolic Maintenance Products, Inc. (Metabolic) values and respects the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to advise you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

What Happened?

We were recently notified that an unknown third party may have gained unauthorized access to names and payment card numbers processed through our website. Upon discovering the potential incident, we engaged a forensic security firm to conduct an in-depth investigation of the incident to confirm the security of our website and systems. The investigation ultimately determined that an unknown, unauthorized third party installed code on our website that transmitted transaction data to the third party. The sophisticated code was designed to evade detection and required specialized analysis to identify and remove it. The code captured and transmitted transaction information for transactions processed through the Metabolic Maintenance Products and the MethylPro websites from approximately May 2020 until July 9, 2021.

What Information Was Involved?

After discovering and removing the code, we compiled a list of all transactions that took place during the relevant timeframe. On August 20, 2021, we determined that your name, address, transaction details, and payment card information for your payment card(s) ending in <<b2b_text_1(LastFourDigits)>> may have been acquired by the third party as a result of the incident.

What We Are Doing.

Upon learning of the incident, we promptly commenced an investigation and hired a leading forensic security firm to confirm the security of our systems and website. Upon identifying the unauthorized code, we removed the code from our website and we began identifying potentially affected customers. We are nearing completion of a new, state-of-the-art website to ensure that our customers' data is secure. We have also taken significant steps to secure our existing website, including an updated firewall configuration, increased logging, and traffic detection. We have notified the credit card brands and law enforcement regarding the incident.

What You Can Do.

If you detect any suspicious activity on your credit card, you should promptly notify your financial institution or credit card company. You can find more information on steps to protect yourself against identity theft or fraud in the enclosed Additional Important Information sheet.

For More Information.

For further information and assistance, please call 1-855-551-1490 from 6:00 A.M. - 3:30 P.M. PST, Monday through Friday, excluding major U.S. holidays.

We value the trust you place in us to protect your privacy and take our responsibility to safeguard your personal information seriously. We apologize for any inconvenience or concern this incident might cause.

Sincerely,

Dan Young

Additional Important Information

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft. For more information and to contact the FTC, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You may also contact the FTC at Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Credit Reports: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/manualRequestForm.action.

Alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies. Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries is as follows:

Equifax 1-866-349-5191 www.equifax.com P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374

TransUnion 1-800-888-4213 www.transunion.com P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016

Fraud Alerts: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. A fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit report for one (1) year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze can be placed without any charge and is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information:

Dear [Customer Name],

We regret to inform you that on September 15, Epik Holdings, Inc. (Epik) confirmed a data intrusion involving its customers' personal information. We are still investigating the matter, but we can now confirm additional details of this intrusion.

What happened: We believe that on or before September 13, 2021, unauthorized third parties accessed a backup copy of Epik's domain-side service accounts through one or more non-public servers.

What personal information may have been obtained: The following information may have been accessed: name, address, email address, username, password, phone and VAT number (if given), transaction history, domain ownership, and for a small subset of users, credit card information.

What we are doing: We have retained multiple cybersecurity partners to investigate the incident, secure our services, help affected users, and notify you, law enforcement, and other relevant authorities. We are continuing to communicate with relevant authorities and other stakeholders as well. At this time, we have secured access to our domain-side services and have applied additional security measures to help protect services and users going forward.

In addition, we will offer free credit monitoring until September 15, 2023, for all affected Epik users; more details on this free service will be made available soon.

Additional options for users:

1. Change your Epik password and enable two-factor authentication by visiting: https://www.epik.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-reset-password-epik-user-password-when-user-forgot-it/

2. Call Epik Toll-Free at 800-510-3282 for further information and assistance.

3. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you place a free fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. This can be done by contacting any one of the three major credit bureaus:

Equifax: equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services or 1-800-685-1111

Experian: experian.com/help or 1-888-397-3742

TransUnion: transunion.com/credit-help or 1-888-909-8872

4. Request a free credit report from each credit bureau after placing a fraud alert on your file. Review these credit reports for any accounts and inquiries you do not recognize, as they may be signs of identity theft. If your personal information has been misused, visit the FTC's site at IdentityTheft.gov to report the identity theft and obtain recovery steps. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the FTC recommends that you check your credit reports periodically so you can spot problems and address them quickly.

5. You may also want to consider placing a free credit freeze on your file. A credit freeze prevents potential creditors from obtaining your credit report, making it less likely for an identity thief to open new accounts in your name. To place a freeze, contact each of the major credit bureaus using the links or phone numbers above. A freeze will remain in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift or remove it.

6. Visit IdentityTheft.gov/databreach, for additional resources and help to protect yourself from identity theft or call 1-877-438-4338.

7. Learn more about your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act here.

8. Contact your local Attorney General or local law enforcement to report suspected identity theft by filing or obtaining a police report.

Thank you for your continued support. We will continue to keep you updated.

We regret to inform you that Forward Air Corporation (Forward Air) recently experienced a data breach that may have impacted the security of your personal information. We are writing to provide you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you can take to better protect yourself against identity theft and fraud.

On December 15, 2020, we discovered suspicious activity occurring within certain company computer systems. We immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. Our investigation revealed that certain Forward Air systems were accessible in November and early December 2020, and that certain data, which may have included your personal information, was potentially viewed or taken by an unknown actor.

On or about July 30, 2021, we determined that your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, or bank account number were potentially viewed and/or taken by an unknown actor. While there is no indication that anyone's information has been subject to actual or attempted misuse, we are notifying you because your information was stored on our systems.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of information entrusted to us are among our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. As part of our ongoing commitment to information security, we are reviewing our existing policies and procedures regarding data privacy and are evaluating additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future. In addition to notifying you, we will also be notifying state regulators, as required.

As a safeguard, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for 12 months provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.

To enroll in this service, please go directly to the myTrueIdentity website at www.mytrueidentity.com and enter the following unique 12-letter Activation Code <<Activation Code>>. Follow the three steps to receive your credit monitoring service online within minutes. If you do not have access to the Internet and wish to enroll in a similar offline, paper-based, credit monitoring service, via U.S. Mail delivery, please call the TransUnion Fraud Response Services toll-free hotline at 1-855-288-5422. When prompted, enter the following 6-digit telephone passcode <<Pass Code>> and follow the steps to enroll in the offline credit monitoring service, add an initial fraud alert to your credit file, or to speak to a TransUnion representative if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft.

Once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain 12 months of unlimited access to your TransUnion credit report and VantageScore credit score by TransUnion. The daily credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit file at TransUnion, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address, and more. The service also includes the ability to lock and unlock your TransUnion credit report online, access to identity restoration services that provide assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity, and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (Policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

You can sign up for the myTrueIdentity online Credit Monitoring service anytime between now and <<Enrollment Deadline>>. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. Please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file at TransUnion, or an address in the United States (or its territories) and a valid Social Security number, or are under the age of 18. Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

We encourage you to monitor your accounts and order your free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Should you wish to place a credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

The Federal Trade Commission may be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580; www.identitytheft.gov; 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); and TTY: 1-866-653-4261. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. You can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. Please note that in order to file a report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some proof that you have been a victim. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should also be reported to law enforcement and your state Attorney General.

If you have any additional questions, please call 1-866-853-3629, Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, except holidays. You may also write to Forward Air at 1915 Snapps Ferry Road, Building N, Greeneville, Tennessee 37745.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

We are writing to you as part of Golden Entertainment Inc.'s (Golden) commitment to privacy. Golden is notifying you of a data security incident involving Golden. Although we have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information as a result of this incident, this letter provides details about the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

In late January, Golden discovered that certain portions of its network were infected with malware. We promptly took steps to secure the network and, with the assistance of computer forensic specialists, conducted an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the event, including any risk to data. The investigation confirmed that an unauthorized actor gained access to a portion of the network and encrypted network files around January 24, 2021. The investigation also determined the unauthorized actor acquired certain documents before the encryption occurred. Given that network locations were accessed without authorization, we undertook a lengthy and time-intensive thorough review of the potentially impacted information in order to identify the information that was potentially impacted and to whom it related. We completed this review on or around August 25, 2021, at which time we confirmed the individuals whose information was present. We then worked to reconcile the results of the review with our internal records in furtherance of identifying the individuals to whom the data related and the appropriate contact information for those individuals in order to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that the information related to you that may have been affected include your <<b2b_text_1(Name, Data Elements)>>. Please note, we do not have any evidence of misuse of any information impacted as a result of this incident.

What We Are Doing.

We take this incident and the security of personal information in our care very seriously. Upon discovering the activity, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the event to confirm its nature and scope. Further, we have security measures in place to protect the data on our systems and we continue to assess and update security measures and training to our employees to safeguard the privacy and security of information in our care. We also notified law enforcement of this event and will be notifying regulatory authorities, as required by law. We are offering you access to 12 months of identity monitoring services through Kroll at no cost to you as an added precaution. If you wish to activate these services, you may follow the instructions included in the attached Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Personal Information. We encourage you to activate these services as we are unable to act on your behalf to do so.

What You Can Do.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and reporting any such activity to law enforcement. You can also activate the complimentary identity monitoring services that we are offering to you. Please also review the information contained in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Personal Information.

Re: Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear [Individual],

MTG greatly values the relationship we have with you and understands the importance of protecting your personal information. We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that occurred on our website www.ReFaUSA.com. While we have no evidence that any of your personal information was accessed, acquired, or misused, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing you notice as a potentially impacted party and outlining proactive steps to protect important personal information. This letter also describes credit protection services we are providing to you free of charge.

What Happened?

After MTG became aware of suspicious activity, we launched a comprehensive investigation, suspended credit card transactions, moved the server offline, and engaged a third-party forensic specialist to determine the nature and scope of the incident. On September 9, 2021, the investigation concluded that the incident occurred between June 25, 2020, and June 15, 2021, potentially exposing certain transactions. MTG reported this security incident to law enforcement.

What Information Was Involved?

According to the forensic firm, the information in this cyber incident concerns payment card information for certain orders placed on our website. The information involved includes the name, address, and credit card information. We want to clarify that we do not store full credit card information beyond the completion of the sales transaction. There was no other personal information involved in this incident.

What We Are Doing

MTG takes the protection of your personal information very seriously. First, it was important to us to let you know about this matter. Second, while we have no evidence indicating that your personal information has been accessed, acquired, or used, to help protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary two-year membership for Experian's IdentityWorksSM. This product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. The Attachment to this letter provides detailed instructions on how you can activate your membership and start monitoring your personal information.

Further, we decided to take a number of other steps to promote security. For example, we implemented enhanced security protocols and suspended all sales activity on our platform to ensure the threat was contained. We have decided to use a new shopping platform to handle credit card processing of orders meeting specific security requirements. The new site will be launched at: www.ReFaUSA.com

What You Can Do

In addition to enrolling in the complimentary two-year membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM, we encourage you to consider these measures to monitor and protect your personal information and to remain vigilant for potential incidents of fraud and identity theft:

Vigilance: Regularly monitor your financial accounts and, if you see any unfamiliar activity, promptly contact your financial institution. Monitor your credit reports, which are available free of charge, as noted below.

Free Annual Credit Report: You may obtain a free annual credit report from each of the three national consumer credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) by calling (877) 322-8228 or by logging onto www.annualcreditreport.com. For more information about obtaining your free credit report, visit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) site at: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/free-credit-reports.

Fraud Alert: You may place a fraud alert on your credit file to ask creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. A request for an initial alert or an extended alert can be made from any of the three national consumer credit reporting companies and can help detect any possible misuse of your personal information. Note that a fraud alert may protect you but also may cause delay when you seek to obtain credit. The initial fraud alert is active for 90 days and can be extended. For more information about fraud alerts and security or credit freezes, visit the FTC site at: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-credit-freezes-and-fraud-alerts.

Security or Credit Freeze: You may place a security freeze, also known as a credit freeze, on your credit report free of charge. A freeze prevents an unauthorized person from using your personal identifying information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national consumer credit reporting companies at the toll-free telephone numbers or websites listed below. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Subject: Unauthorized Access to Your Coinbase Account

Dear [Insert customer name],

We are writing to inform you about an unauthorized third party gaining access to your Coinbase account and what we are doing to help you manage this.

Unfortunately, between March and May 20, 2021, you were a victim of a third-party campaign to gain unauthorized access to the accounts of Coinbase customers and move customer funds off the Coinbase platform. At least 6,000 Coinbase customers had funds removed from their accounts, including you.

In order to access your Coinbase account, these third parties first needed prior knowledge of the email address, password, and phone number associated with your Coinbase account, as well as access to your personal email inbox. While we are not able to determine conclusively how these third parties gained access to this information, this type of campaign typically involves phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques to trick a victim into unknowingly disclosing login credentials to a bad actor. We have not found any evidence that these third parties obtained this information from Coinbase itself.

Even with the information described above, additional authentication is required in order to access your Coinbase account. However, in this incident, for customers who use SMS texts for two-factor authentication, the third party took advantage of a flaw in Coinbase's SMS Account Recovery process in order to receive an SMS two-factor authentication token and gain access to your account.

As soon as Coinbase learned of this issue, we updated our SMS Account Recovery protocols to prevent any further bypassing of that authentication process.

We will be depositing funds into your account equal to the value of the currency improperly removed from your account at the time of the incident. Some customers have already been reimbursed -- we will ensure all customers affected receive the full value of what you lost. You should see this reflected in your account no later than today.

We are setting up a dedicated phone support line for our customers who have been impacted by this at 1 (844) 613-1499. These representatives are aware of this incident and can answer additional questions you may have. This phone support line is available for questions and support related to this incident only -- other general inquiries should be directed to https://help.coinbase.com/en/contact-us.

We will be providing free credit monitoring to affected customers who are interested and if available in your country of residence. We will be sharing information about how to obtain that service in a separate communication shortly.

Coinbase has also been working closely with law enforcement to support its investigation into the individuals behind this incident. Coinbase's internal investigation into this incident is ongoing.

The third party who accessed your Coinbase account would have been able to view the following information, depending on what information you have in your account: your full name, email address, home address, date of birth, IP addresses for account activity, transaction history, account holdings, and balance.

We strongly encourage our customers who currently use SMS-based two-factor authentication to use an even stronger method of securing their Coinbase accounts, such as time-based one-time password (TOTP) or a hardware security key.

We also strongly encourage you to change the password on your Coinbase account to a new, strong and unique password that you do not use on any other site. Because the third parties needed access to your personal email account as part of this incident, we strongly encourage you to change your password in the same way for your email account and for any other online accounts where you use a similar password.

We encourage you to monitor your personal accounts and free credit reports for any suspicious activity, consistent with best practices for the next 12-24 months. Incidents of suspected identity theft can and should be reported to law enforcement and government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

We recognize that the trust you place in Coinbase is precious and we will continuously work to uphold the highest standards to maintain that trust. Please be assured that we will continue to aggressively pursue bad actors and monitor our products to ensure the highest standards of security are met. If you need additional assistance with your account, please don't hesitate to reply to this support case.

Sincerely,
The Coinbase Team	The unauthorized third party gained access to customers' Coinbase accounts using phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques and moved customer funds off the platform, taking advantage of a flaw in Coinbase's SMS Account Recovery process to bypass two-factor authentication. At least 6,000 customers had funds removed from their accounts, and the intruder was able to view sensitive information such as names, email addresses, home addresses, transaction history, account holdings, and balance. Coinbase reimbursed all affected customers and provided free credit monitoring and support through a phone line. The case is still under investigation.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

To Our Customers,

We are writing to notify you about an issue that may involve your Neiman Marcus online account information.

What Happened?

Earlier this month, we learned that in May 2020 an unauthorized party obtained personal information associated with certain of our customers' online accounts.

What Information Was Involved?

The personal information for affected customers varied and may have included your name and contact information; payment card number and expiration date (without CVV number); Neiman Marcus virtual gift card number (without PIN); and the username, password, and security questions and answers associated with your Neiman Marcus online account. More than 85% of affected payment and virtual gift cards are expired or invalid.

What We Are Doing

Promptly after learning of the issue, we engaged a leading cybersecurity expert and notified law enforcement. Our investigation is ongoing, and we are working quickly to determine the nature and scope of the matter. To protect our customers, we required an online account password reset for affected customers who had not changed their password since May 2020. We will continue to take actions to enhance our system security and safeguard information.

What You Can Do

We deeply regret that this incident occurred. We take our obligation to safeguard personal information very seriously and are alerting you so you can take steps to help protect your information. These steps include the following:

- If you detect unauthorized transactions involving your payment card, please contact your payment card company or financial institution.
- Change your credentials for any other online account if you used credentials that are the same as or similar to those used for your Neiman Marcus account.
- Order a credit report. You are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports.

The Reference Guide below provides recommendations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on the protection of personal information.

For More Information

We hope this information is useful to you. For more details about this issue, please visit https://www.neimanmarcus.com/2021-customer-online-account-info or call (866) 571-9725 Monday through Friday 8 a.m. - 10 p.m. CST, Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. - 7 p.m. CST (excluding major U.S. holidays).

We regret any inconvenience this may cause you.

Sincerely,

David Goubert
President and Chief Customer Officer

Reference Guide

We encourage affected customers to take the following steps:

Order Your Free Credit Report. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three nationwide consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit reports only through the website, toll-free number, or request form.

When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look in the inquiries section for names of creditors from whom you have not requested credit. Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. The consumer reporting agency will be able to tell you when that is the case. Look in the personal information section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as home address and Social Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the consumer reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate consumer reporting agency by telephone and in writing. Consumer reporting agency staff will review your report with you. If the information cannot be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved. Information that cannot be explained also should be reported to your local police or sheriff's office because it may signal criminal activity.

Report Incidents. If you detect any unauthorized transactions in a financial account, promptly notify your payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud, promptly report the incident to law enforcement, the FTC, and your state Attorney General. If you believe your identity has been stolen, the FTC recommends that you take these steps:

- Close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. For streamlined checklists and sample letters to help guide you through the recovery process, please visit https://www.identitytheft.gov/.
- File a local police report. Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors and any others that may require proof of the identity theft crime.

You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft and how to repair identity theft:

Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer reporting agencies. For more information on fraud alerts, you also may contact the FTC as described above.

To Whom It May Concern:

In accordance with Iowa Code 715C.1, 715C.2, I am writing on behalf of The Neiman Marcus Group, LLC (NMG or the Company) to notify you regarding a data security issue. Earlier this month, NMG learned that in May 2020 an unauthorized party obtained personal information associated with certain Neiman Marcus customers online accounts. The personal information for affected customers varied and may have included names and contact information; payment card numbers and expiration dates (without CVV numbers); Neiman Marcus virtual gift card numbers (without PINs); and usernames, passwords, and security questions and answers associated with Neiman Marcus online accounts. More than 85 percent of the affected payment and virtual gift cards are expired or invalid. Although the affected payment and virtual gift card data and a portion of the impacted passwords were encrypted, the unauthorized party appears to have obtained the relevant decryption keys. The rest of the impacted passwords were hashed. The Company previously discontinued use of security questions and answers for customers Neiman Marcus online accounts.

Promptly after learning of the issue, NMG engaged Mandiant, a leading cybersecurity expert, and notified federal law enforcement. NMG's investigation is ongoing, and the Company is working quickly to determine the nature and scope of the matter. To protect the Company's customers, NMG required an online account password reset for affected customers who had not changed their password since May 2020. The Company will continue to take actions to enhance its system security and safeguard information.

NMG identified approximately 12,501 Iowa residents whose information was affected by this issue. Enclosed for your reference is a copy of the notice being emailed to affected customers.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Very truly yours,
Lisa J. Sotto

If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.consumer.ftc.gov, www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

Copy of Credit Report:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print this form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf. You also can contact one of the following three national credit reporting agencies:

Equifax, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, 1-800-525-6285, www.equifax.com.

Experian, P.O. Box 9532, Allen, TX 75013, 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com.

TransUnion, P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 19016, 1-800-916-8800, www.transunion.com.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two kinds of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report – an initial alert and an extended alert. You may want to consider placing either or both fraud alerts on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft and provide the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert is also free and will stay on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com. Military members may also place an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert on their credit reports while deployed. An Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment.

Credit or Security Freezes: Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, for up to one year at no cost. The freeze will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. For information and instructions on how to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies identified above. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place as you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze from my credit reports? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or via phone, a credit bureau must lift the credit freeze within an hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after receiving your request.

IRS Identity Protection PIN:

You can obtain an identity protection PIN (IP PIN) from the IRS that prevents someone else from filing a tax return using your Social Security number. The IP PIN is known only to you and the IRS and helps the IRS verify your identity when you file your electronic or paper tax return. You can learn more and obtain your IP PIN here: https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin.

You also have certain rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA): These rights include the right to know what is in your file; to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information; to have consumer reporting agencies correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. For more information about the FCRA, and your rights pursuant to the FCRA, please visit http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201504_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state attorney general about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the attorney general in your state.

California Residents: Visit the California Office of Privacy Protection (www.oag.ca.gov/privacy) for additional information on protection against identity theft.

Re: Possible Disclosure of Personal Information
[MONTH DAY, YEAR]

Dear [INDIVIDUAL NAME]:

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information which is why we are writing to advise you of a recent incident that may involve the compromise of your personal data. Protecting account data and the personal information of our customers is a responsibility that we take seriously. During August 2021 customer envelopes were mailed to individuals for purposes of verifying the information that had been provided to us in connection with an existing account or application for credit. We have determined that an envelope containing your personal information, including your name, social security number, address, and date of birth, may have been erroneously sent to a different individual. Please know that as soon as we learned of the incident, we immediately began working to investigate the matter. Enhanced quality control has been put in place to ensure this will no longer occur.

While we currently have no indication that your information has been used in an inappropriate or unauthorized manner, Synchrony Bank would nonetheless like to offer you a one-year subscription to a credit report monitoring service paid for by the Bank. If you would like to receive the credit report monitoring service or have any questions, contact us at 855-945-3565, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST within 90 days of the date of this letter.

Further, we recommend taking the following action immediately:

1. Place a fraud alert on your credit files: We strongly recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit files. The fraud alert is free and will require potential creditors to verify your identity before issuing credit in your name, thereby reducing or hopefully eliminating the likelihood of the creation of an unauthorized account. A call to any one of the three credit reporting agencies listed below will place a fraud alert on your credit file with all three agencies. You don't need to call all three agencies. You will receive letters from the agencies confirming the fraud alert and informing you about how to get a free copy of your credit report. The fraud alert is renewable every 90 days.

2. Carefully review your credit report: Once you obtain your free credit report examine it carefully, looking for accounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate, or personal information that is not accurate. If you notice any of these things or have any questions, promptly call the credit reporting agency that provided the report. If you do find suspicious activity on your credit reports, also call your local police or Sheriff's office to file a report of identity theft. Make sure to ask for a copy of the police report as you may need to provide copies to creditors to clear up your records. Even if you do not find any signs of fraud on your reports, we recommend that you check your credit reports periodically.

3. You may add a security freeze on your credit file: A security freeze will prevent new credit accounts from being opened in your name without the use of a Personal Identification Number (PIN) that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency identified above. There may be a fee to place, lift, or remove a security freeze.

For more information on identity theft, we suggest that you visit the Federal Trade Commission's website at www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

Again, we sincerely regret this incident and want to assure you we do treat the security of the information entrusted to us with the utmost importance.

Sincerely,

On August 30, 2021, PCB detected unusual activity on its network. We immediately took action to disable the activity, investigate its source, and monitor our network. Subsequently, we became aware of claims that we had been the target of a ransomware attack. On September 7, 2021, we confirmed that an external actor had illegally accessed and/or acquired certain data on our network. We have been working with third-party forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incident, identify the information that may have been accessed and/or acquired, and determine who may have been affected. The investigation revealed that this incident impacted certain files containing certain PCB customer information. Some of these files contained documents related to loan applications, such as tax returns, Form W-2 information of their employees, and payroll records. Your information was included as part of the supporting documentation of your employer's loan application.

What Information Was Involved:

The personal information that may have been impacted includes your name, address, Social Security Number, wage and/or tax information. Please note that the exact nature and extent of personal information impacted may vary by individual.

What We Are Doing:

The privacy and security of the information entrusted to us is of the utmost importance to PCB, and we take this incident very seriously. We have reported this incident to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. As part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring the security of information in our care, we have conducted a thorough investigation into this incident and are continuing to monitor our systems' security. Additionally, we are reviewing our existing policies and procedures, including our information security plan, to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future.

What You Can Do:

It is always important to remain vigilant and monitor your financial account statements and credit reports for signs of fraud. In addition, PCB is offering you one year of free Equifax Complete Premier credit monitoring and identity theft protection. You will not be billed for this service. Instructions for enrolling in the Equifax Complete Premier program are enclosed with this letter. If you are under the age of 18, you will need to call 855-675-2855 to receive a code that allows you to enroll in the Equifax credit monitoring and identity theft protection service for individuals under age 18. The enclosed material also provides important information about additional steps you can take to protect your information.

Security Freeze Information:

You can request a Security Freeze on your credit file by sending a request in writing, by mail, to each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. When a Security Freeze is added to your credit report, all third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. The Security Freeze may delay, interfere with or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make that involves access to your credit report. This may include, but is not limited to, new loans, credit, mortgages, insurance, rental housing, employment, investments, licenses, cellular phone service, utility service, digital signature service, Internet credit card transactions, and extension of credit at the point of sale.

Other Important Information:

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft, you should contact your local law enforcement, the Federal Trade Commission, and/or your state's Attorney General and file a police report.

Please know that the security of your information is of paramount importance to us, and we deeply regret any worry or inconvenience this incident may have caused. If you have additional questions, please call 855-675-2855 between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

1 The credit scores provided are based on the VantageScore 3.0 model. For three-bureau VantageScore credit scores, data from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are used respectively. Any one-bureau VantageScore uses Equifax data. Third parties use many different types of credit scores and are likely to use a different type of credit score to assess your creditworthiness.

3 WebScan searches for your Social Security Number, up to 5 passport numbers, up to 6 bank account numbers, up to 6 credit/debit card numbers, up to 6 email addresses, and up to 10 medical ID numbers. WebScan searches thousands of Internet sites where consumers' personal information is suspected of being bought and sold and regularly adds new sites to the list of those it searches. However, the Internet addresses of these suspected Internet trading sites are not published and frequently change, so there is no guarantee that we are able to locate and search every possible Internet site where consumers' personal information is at risk of being traded.
4 The Automatic Fraud Alert feature is made available to consumers by Equifax Information Services LLC and fulfilled on its behalf by Equifax Consumer Services LLC.
5 Locking your Equifax credit report will prevent access to it by certain third parties. Locking your Equifax credit report will not prevent access to your credit report at any other credit reporting agency. Entities that may still have access to your Equifax credit report include: companies like Equifax Global Consumer Solutions, which provide you with access to your credit report or credit score, or monitor your credit report as part of a subscription or similar service; companies that provide you with a copy of your credit report or credit score, upon your request; federal, state and local government agencies and courts in certain circumstances; companies using the information in connection with the underwriting of insurance, or for employment, tenant or background screening purposes; companies that have a current account or relationship with you, and collection agencies acting on behalf of those whom you owe; companies that authenticate a consumer's identity for purposes other than granting credit, or for investigating or	The breach was caused by an external actor that engaged in illegal access and/or acquisition of certain data on Pacific City Bank's network.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear [FIRST NAME]:

We are writing to inform you of an incident potentially involving some of your personal information held by Terrier Media Buyer, Inc. dba Cox Media Group (CMG). We want to make clear at the outset that keeping personal data safe and secure is very important to us and we deeply regret that this incident occurred.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On or about June 3, 2021, a third party sought to disrupt our operations by means of an unauthorized, remote access to our computer network. After becoming aware of the incident, we quickly took steps to secure our systems and began a thorough investigation with the support of leading outside cybersecurity experts. We also promptly notified the FBI of the incident.

CMG has determined that the unauthorized third party accessed a server containing limited personal information collected for human resources purposes. The unauthorized third party created a copy of that data on our systems and tried to remove a copy of that data from our network. We have completed our investigation and have no evidence confirming that your personal information was acquired by the unauthorized third party or misused as a result of this incident. Nevertheless, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution because your information was contained in the data set that the unauthorized actor attempted to obtain.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

The types of personal information that the unauthorized third party may have obtained included your name, [additional data fields].

WHAT WE ARE DOING

We have implemented enhanced security controls and have been cooperating with law enforcement to investigate this incident.

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have affected the privacy of some of your personal information. We want you to understand the steps we have taken to address this issue and additional steps that can be taken to protect your personal information. This letter explains the incident and offers you assistance for safeguarding your information, including complimentary identity monitoring services.

What Happened

On August 8, 2021, an unauthorized party accessed the ReproSource network. We discovered ransomware on the morning of August 10, and in less than an hour we severed all network connection activity and contained the incident. We immediately launched a comprehensive investigation to determine the cause and scope of the incident. We retained leading cybersecurity experts to assist with our investigation, confirmed containment of the ransomware, and quickly and securely recovered operations. Additionally, we promptly notified law enforcement.

While our investigation did not confirm that the unauthorized party acquired data in the incident, out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying individuals whose personal information may have been accessed. We undertook an extensive analysis of our files to determine which individuals and data may have been affected and, on September 24, 2021, we identified individuals potentially affected. Although our data analysis is ongoing, in the interest of initiating notifications, we are sending you this notice and providing the services outlined in this letter.

What Information Was Involved

Based on our investigation to date, some of your personal information was in files that may have been accessed or acquired without authorization. This information included your name and one or more of the following: address, phone number, email address, date of birth, billing and health information, such as CPT codes, diagnosis codes, test requisitions and results, test reports and/or medical history information, health insurance or group plan identification names and numbers, and other information provided by you or your treating physician. As previously noted, since our data analysis is ongoing, we will follow up with you as appropriate if we identify other types of personal information that may have been accessed.

What We Are Doing

As discussed above, upon learning of the attack, we immediately severed all network connection activity and contained the incident. We also enhanced our cybersecurity by adding additional monitoring and detection tools as safeguards against ransomware and other cyber threats.

What You Can Do

To help relieve concerns following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll Inc. to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.

Re: Notice of Data Breach Affecting ReproSource

Dear Attorney General Miller,

I write on behalf of ReproSource Fertility Diagnostics, Inc. (ReproSource or Company) regarding a security incident. On August 8, 2021, an unauthorized party accessed the ReproSource network. The Company discovered ransomware on the morning of August 10, and in less than an hour severed all network connection activity and contained the incident. ReproSource immediately launched a comprehensive investigation to determine the cause and scope of the incident, retained leading cybersecurity experts to assist with its investigation, confirmed containment of the ransomware, and quickly and securely recovered operations. Additionally, the Company promptly notified law enforcement.

While the Company's investigation did not confirm that the unauthorized party acquired data in the incident, out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying individuals whose personal information may have been accessed. ReproSource undertook an extensive analysis of its files to determine which individuals and data may have been affected, and on September 24, 2021, the Company began identifying individuals potentially affected. Although our data analysis is ongoing, in the interest of initiating notifications, we are in the process of informing individuals whose personal information may have been affected and offering them a one-year free subscription to Kroll's identity monitoring services.

Based on its investigation to date, ReproSource has determined that personal information in files that may have been accessed or acquired without authorization included: names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, billing and health information, such as CPT codes, diagnosis codes, test requisitions and results, test reports and/or medical history information, health insurance or group plan identification names and numbers, and other information provided by individuals or by treating physicians. For a small group of individuals, personal information may have included drivers license numbers, passport numbers, social security numbers, financial account numbers, and credit card numbers.

We began mailing notifications on October 8, 2021. Because our data analysis remains ongoing, we have not yet been able to determine the final number of Iowa residents impacted. To date, we have identified approximately 74 Iowa residents who may have been impacted by the incident. As our analysis progresses, we will keep your office informed if we identify additional Iowa residents.

ReproSource has enhanced its cybersecurity by adding additional monitoring and detection tools as safeguards against ransomware and other cyber threats. Unaddressed copies of the letters are attached. ReproSource has also established a call center to answer patients' questions ((855) 732-0717).

ReproSource remains committed to protecting its patients' personal information and assisting those who may have been affected by this incident. ReproSource is providing notices to individuals pursuant to 45 CFR 164.400-414 and applicable state laws. By virtue of this notice, the Company does not waive any rights and reserves all rights under such laws.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this letter.

Sincerely,

Phyllis B. Sumner

We are writing to inform you of a recent cybersecurity incident that may have involved some of your personal information. At Timios, Inc., we take the security and integrity of our data very seriously and regret any concern this may cause.

What Happened?

We detected unauthorized access to certain devices in our network, resulting in the encryption of some of our systems. We immediately activated our incident response plan, took measures to stop the unauthorized access, and launched an investigation. A cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with the investigation and determine the nature and scope of the incident. Through the investigation, we identified unauthorized access to Timios systems between July 19-25, 2021. On July 30, 2021, the investigation determined that personal information related to some individuals may have been accessed or acquired by an unauthorized actor during that time, but was unable to determine whether the unauthorized actor actually viewed any of the information. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying all individuals whose data may have been accessed. We reviewed the files that may have been accessed or acquired and determined on September 7, 2021, that your information may have been involved.

What Information Was Involved?

The information accessed or acquired may include your name and one or more of the following: Social Security number, driver's license or state-issued identification number, passport number, tax identification number, military identification number, financial account number, payment card number, and/or date of birth.

What We Are Doing:

We notified law enforcement and are fully cooperating with their investigation. We are also taking a number of steps to help prevent something like this from occurring again. We implemented additional measures to further enhance our security protocols and are providing continued education and training to our employees.

As a precaution, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership to Experian's IdentityWorks Credit 3B.

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft, as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security	The unauthorized access to certain devices in Timios' network and the encryption of some systems indicate that this is a hacking incident.

PetroQuest Energy LLC is writing to inform you of a recent cybersecurity incident that may have involved some of your personal information. On April 9, 2021, PetroQuest discovered unauthorized access to its systems that may have resulted in access to your personally identifiable information (PII). After learning about the potential unauthorized access, PetroQuest engaged a forensic team to review the impacted system in order to learn more about the scope and extent of the incident, and whether PII may have been exposed. The forensic investigation confirmed that an unauthorized individual had access to our systems between March 13, 2021 and April 9, 2021.

The forensic investigation determined that some files on our systems may have been accessed by the unauthorized individual. The investigation was not able to definitively conclude what information stored on our systems, if any, was in fact accessed by the bad actor. However, the investigation did reveal that the bad actor may have had access to PetroQuest's Quorum database which contains landowner and lease agreements. Notably, much of the information contained in the lease agreements are public record. However, certain older files containing lease agreements and lease packets may have included individuals W-9s with their taxpayer ID or social security number. While there is no evidence that the bad actor actually accessed, copied, archived, exfiltrated, or misused imaged files contained in this database, PetroQuest is nonetheless notifying individuals of this incident out of an abundance of caution. Given the size and age of the database, PetroQuest had to manually review its records dating back many years to identify potentially affected individuals. This exercise was completed by PetroQuest on September 23, 2021.

PetroQuest takes the security of your personal information very seriously, and has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. In order to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we are offering you access to credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 12 months at no cost to you, through Equifax. You may find information on how to enroll in these services in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Personal Information.

We encourage you to remain vigilant and review the enclosed addendum outlining additional steps you can take to protect your personal information. If you have any questions or want to enroll in the complimentary identity monitoring services, please call 1-800-601-9089, Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

As a result, your personal information may have been potentially exposed to an unauthorized individual. Please be assured that we have taken every step necessary to address the incident.

What Happened:
This incident occurred as a result of a PSRS/PEERS employee's email account being accessed by an unauthorized individual. The PSRS/PEERS information technology department disabled the impacted employee's email account within a few minutes of being notified of the unauthorized access. The unauthorized individual had access to this account for less than one hour.

Newbridge Securities Corporation understands the importance of protecting the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you may consider taking in response.

What Happened?
Newbridge has concluded an investigation into a network intrusion incident by an unauthorized person. Upon learning of the incident, we took immediate steps to secure the network, began an investigation, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist.

What Information Was Involved?
Although the investigation determined that some of Newbridge's network systems were accessed by an unauthorized person between February 24, 2021, and March 18, 2021, the investigation was unable to determine what, if any, information was accessed. Nonetheless, Newbridge conducted a thorough review of potentially accessed information and concluded that potential access to some individual personal information could not be ruled out, even though the precise personal information potentially at risk could not be determined. We determined on August 30, 2021, that information of current or former customers may have been accessed and may have included your name, address, Social Security number, and Newbridge account information.

What We Are Doing.
To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, Newbridge has increased several of its security measures, including but not limited to removing legacy authentication methods, increasing audit logging on all systems, applying hardening policies for greater encryption on system communication, increasing the sensitivity of endpoint protection, strengthening password policies to require greater complexity, implementing multifactor authentication for both internal and remote network access, and strengthening email security efforts for identifying phishing or malicious content as well as internal training for our users to identify these types of cyberattacks.

What Can You Do?
We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your financial account statements and credit reports for unauthorized activity. If you notice any unauthorized activity, you should immediately report it to the relevant financial institution or the credit bureau reporting the activity. To help protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of Experian IdentityWorksSM.

Background:

Your Anthem health plan offers a program called VillageHealth to assist members who have End Stage Kidney Disease. The program provides care coordination between your dialysis center, nephrologist, provider, and Anthem. VillageHealth uses a vendor, PracticeMax, to share the results with Anthem.

What Happened:

The PracticeMax network experienced a ransomware attack, during which it was subject to unauthorized access, beginning on April 17, 2021, and ending on May 5, 2021. On May 1, 2021, upon discovery of the incident, PracticeMax immediately initiated a review of the incident, engaged legal counsel, and hired a security forensics firm to conduct a thorough investigation.

PracticeMax regained access to its systems on May 6, 2021, and determined that one server containing Protected Health Information (PHI) was accessed, and certain files may have been removed.

On August 19, 2021, PracticeMax concluded its investigation, conducted by its third-party security forensics firm. The investigation revealed that some of your personal information may have been accessed by an unauthorized individual.

What Information Was Involved:

The information that was potentially accessed includes your first and last name, date of birth, address, phone number, Anthem member ID number, and clinical data pertaining to kidney care services that you received. This incident did not impact your financial information or Social Security Number.

What We Are Doing:

PracticeMax is committed to safeguarding your personal information. Upon learning of the incident, PracticeMax moved quickly to confirm the security of their systems. As part of PracticeMax's ongoing commitment to the privacy of information in our care, we reviewed our existing policies and procedures and implemented additional safeguards to further secure the information in our systems. These included rebuilding systems, enhancing firewalls, and installing additional endpoint software, among other things. We also notified regulatory authorities and law enforcement.

As an added precaution, we arranged to have Epiq provide credit monitoring services for twenty-four (24) months at no cost to you. Instructions for enrollment are included in the enclosed Steps You Can Take To Protect Your Information.

Monitor Your Accounts

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Should you wish to place a credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

You can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. Please note that in order to file a report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some proof that you have been a victim. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should also be reported to law enforcement and your state Attorney General. This notice has not been delayed by law enforcement.

To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

- Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
- Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

- Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
- TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
- Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348	The breach was due to an unauthorized actor exploiting a configuration error in the Microsoft Power Apps portal.

Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Personal Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Copy of Credit Report:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security Number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft.

To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:
Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:
- Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
- TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com

Notice of Data Breach

Dear Ryan Aaron:

We are writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your information. We are providing this notice to explain the incident and measures we have taken, and also to provide some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

On June 22, 2021, some Centinela Valley Union High School District computer systems were infected with malware that encrypted the data on those machines. We quickly identified and contained the malware, began to restore access to data, and launched an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm.

What Information Was Involved?

On July 8, 2021, the investigation determined that an unauthorized person accessed computer systems that store data pertaining to current and former employees and students, including names, Social Security numbers, financial accounts, health insurance information, and/or medical information. While we have no evidence that your personal information has been stolen or misused, our investigation thus far has not been able to rule out that possibility.

What Are We Doing?

We have taken steps to help prevent a similar incident in the future, including the implementation of additional security safeguards and controls in our network infrastructure. In an abundance of caution, the District is offering you a complimentary one-year membership in identity theft protection services through IDX. IDX identity protection services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraudan initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze.

For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com

Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

4851-4943-1283.4

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<Name 1>>,

We are reaching out to you again in regards to the security incident that may have compromised the payment card you used in March 2021 for a transaction or attempted transaction at www.scufgaming.com. We have completed our investigation and wanted to inform you of the situation. Please note that this communication does not mean that fraud did or will occur on your payment card account. However, we advise you to monitor your account and notify your card provider of any unusual or suspicious activity. As a precaution, you may wish to request a new payment card number from your provider.

What Happened?
On February 3, 2021, login credentials for a third-party vendor were used to insert an unauthorized script onto the backend system of SCUF Gaming's webstore. The unauthorized script was detected on March 16, 2021, and removed immediately on that same day. We conducted a rigorous investigation in partnership with third-party forensic specialists to identify what the script could do and determined on April 21, 2021, that the script was capable of capturing credit card information. We then worked to determine the window of time where credit card information could have potentially been exposed which concluded on July 21, 2021. The investigation confirmed there was a chance the unauthorized script present on our site may have exposed some of your personal information at the point of sale. We are unable to confirm if any credit card transactions during this time period were affected.

What Information Was Involved?
Our investigation has determined that orders processed via PayPal were not compromised, and that the incident was limited to payments or attempted payments via credit card between February 3rd and March 16th. The potentially exposed data was limited to cardholder name, email address, billing address, credit card number, expiration date, and CVV.

What We Are Doing
As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity on our website and continuously improve our security protocols. We will continue to enhance our security features to defend against security threats. In addition, we are also increasing the scrutiny of our third-party vendors and continuing to work with third-party forensics experts to prevent future incidents.

What You Can Do
We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors over the next 12 to 24 months. You can find out more about how to protect against potential identity theft and fraud in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information.

Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information
Monitor Your Accounts
Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Should you wish to place a credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

You can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. Please note that in order to file a report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some proof that you have been a victim.

Monitor Your Accounts

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)
Social Security number
Date of birth
Addresses for the prior two to five years
Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill
A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, etc.)
A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

We want to inform you about a recent event involving your information.

What happened?

On August 3, 2021, a physical break-in occurred at a Merced City School District vendor's location. The vendor, known as The Foundation for Medical Care of Merced, (the Foundation), previously provided all third party administration services for the school district's medical and dental plans, and currently provides member claims services for the school district's medical plans. Such services included the processing and payment of medical and dental claims that are submitted from health care providers or members to the Foundation. The unknown intruder entered the facility by punching a hole in the internal wall from an adjacent office suite. The intruder stole several items, including an external back up drive that was used to scan the paper claims that may have included information about you. The Foundation reported this incident to the City of Merced Police Department immediately.

What information was involved?

Information included on a claim: First and last name, Healthcare Identification number, address, date of birth, Provider Name, procedure and diagnosis code and claim charges.

What can you do?

As is the case with your financial and personal records, it is recommended that you closely monitor all medical and healthcare records to ensure that your identity is not compromised by means of medical information.

3. Ask for a credit (security) freeze or fraud alert.

Fraud Alert

A fraud alert is a temporary (90 day) alert that can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name. This alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but may delay you from getting credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three national credit reporting companies. When that bureau processes your fraud alert, it will tell the other two bureaus to place a fraud alert in your file.

Credit (security) freeze

A credit or security freeze is when you ask a credit reporting company to block others from looking at your credit report. This can makes it harder for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name.

To place a security freeze with one or more of the three national credit reporting companies, please contact the company and give the information as noted below:

Equifax Security Freeze	The breach was caused by a physical break-in at a vendor's location, where an external backup drive containing personal identification information was stolen along with other items.

Dear [Insert Name],

Re: Notice of a Data Security Incident (Please read this letter in its entirety)

I am writing to inform you that an unauthorized third-party accessed my office computer that contained your personal information. With the assistance of professional security experts, we are taking all necessary steps to limit the potential adverse consequences of this security incident.

As a precautionary measure, I would like to offer you one year of complimentary credit and fraud monitoring services, as well as identity theft insurance at no cost. Enrollment instructions are provided with this letter.

What Happened
On or around July 8, 2021, an email purporting to come from a potential client was sent to my office. The email contained malware, which gave access to unknown individual(s) to my office computer. This computer contained your personal information. This breach was discovered in late July of 2021 and was immediately remediated by removing all malware and changing account passwords. A thorough investigation was then conducted. Based on the review of the situation and an examination of the affected data, it is possible that some personal data belonging to you was potentially exposed to the unauthorized intruder. I am therefore taking appropriate precautionary measures to ensure your financial security and help alleviate concerns you may have.

What Information Was Involved
The affected data included personal information, including but not limited to names, associated contact information, and Social Security numbers.

What We Are Doing
I have made immediate enhancements to my systems, security, and practices. Additionally, I have engaged appropriate experts to assist in conducting a full review of my security practices and systems to ensure that appropriate security protocols are in place going forward. I am committed to helping those people who may have been impacted by this unfortunate situation.

In addition, we are providing you with access to the following services:

- Triple Bureau Credit Monitoring/Triple Bureau Credit Report/Triple Bureau Credit Score/Cyber Monitoring* services at no charge. These services provide you with alerts for twelve months from the date of enrollment when changes occur to any of one of your Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion credit files. This notification is sent to you the same day that the change or update takes place with the bureau. The cyber monitoring will review the dark web and alert you if your personally identifiable information is found online. To enroll in Credit Monitoring* services at no charge, please log on to https://www.myidmanager.com and follow the instructions provided. When prompted please provide the following unique code to receive services: [Insert Code Here]. In order for you to receive the monitoring services described above, you must enroll within 90 days from the date of this letter.

- Proactive fraud assistance to help with any questions that you might have.

Representatives are available for 90 days from the date of this letter, to assist you with questions regarding this incident, between the hours of 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday. Please call the help line 1-800-405-6108 and supply the fraud specialist with your unique code listed below. To extend these services, enrollment in the monitoring services described below is required.

What You Can Do
You are encouraged to remain vigilant against fraud and identity theft, including over the next twelve to twenty-four months, by regularly reviewing your financial account statements and monitoring credit reports for suspicious activity, and to immediately report any unauthorized charges to the card issuer. The phone number to call is usually on the back of the credit or debit card. Any incidents of suspected identity theft may be reported to financial institutions and law enforcement, including the Federal Trade Commission.

Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report at the numbers and websites identified below. You also have the right to place a "security freeze" on your credit report at no cost or charge, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who may access the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or to lift a security freeze on your credit report.

Should you wish to place a fraud alert on your file, you have the right to do so at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies.

You may also contact the Federal Trade Commission for additional information regarding consumer protection at:

You can also apply for an Identity Protection Pin (IP PIN) with the IRS to prevent unauthorized persons from filing a tax return in your place. If you want to request an IP PIN, you must first create an online account with the IRS. For more information about the IP PIN and instructions on obtaining an IP PIN, please visit https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin. In the event that you do not have access to the internet and have income of $72,000 or less, you can also use IRS Form 15227, Application for an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number to apply for an IP PIN. In the alternative, you can also obtain an IP PIN by making an appointment at your local IRS Office's Taxpayer Assistance Center.

While representatives should be able to provide thorough assistance and answer most of your questions, you may still feel the need to speak with me regarding this incident. If so, please call me at 650-692-4177 from 9am to 5pm, Pacific Time, Monday through Friday.

I take my responsibilities to protect your personal information very seriously. I am deeply disturbed by this situation and apologize for any inconvenience.

Sincerely,

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts:

There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been or are about to be a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes:

You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports?

There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze?

A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

At AGI Publishing, Inc. (d/b/a Valley Yellow Pages) (AGI), we value transparency and respect the privacy of your information. We are writing to let you know about a data breach that may involve your personal information, what we did in response, and steps you can take to protect yourself against possible misuse of your personal information.

What Happened

On September 11, 2021, we discovered that we were the victim of a sophisticated ransomware attack that impacted our networks and servers. After discovering the incident, we quickly took steps to secure and safely restore our systems and operations via viable backups. Further, we immediately engaged outside counsel and third-party forensic experts to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident's nature and scope, assist in remediation efforts, and contacted and filed a report with the FBI. We concluded our investigation on October 19, 2021, and determined that the unauthorized individual gained access to and potentially obtained information from our systems.

Concurrent to our investigation, we began a comprehensive review of the impacted data and believe that your personal and/or protected health information was potentially involved in the incident. However, as of now, we have no evidence indicating misuse of any information, but we wanted to notify you of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

What Information Was Involved

The types of information potentially involved are your first and last name, address, social security number, and date of birth. If you were on the health plan between 2016 and 2018, the impacted information may also include your health plan number and monthly premium amount. If you were on the Ameritas dental plan any time since 2007, the impacted information may also include your payment amounts for dental claims.

What We Are Doing

As explained above, we took immediate steps to secure our systems, contacted the FBI, and engaged third-party forensic experts to assist in the investigation. Further, in response to this incident, we are implementing additional cybersecurity safeguards, enhancing our employee cybersecurity training, and working to improve our cybersecurity policies, procedures, and protocols to help minimize the likelihood of this type of incident from occurring again.

What You Can Do

The security and privacy of the information contained within our systems are a top priority for us. Therefore, while we have no evidence indicating your information was misused, we strongly recommend you remain vigilant, monitor and review all of your financial and account statements, and report any unusual activity to the institution that issued the record and law enforcement.

Dear <<Borrower>>

We are contacting you to make you aware of a data breach incident that recently occurred in connection with a ransomware attempt by unknown individuals. As set forth below, although Goldwater Bank, N.A. (Goldwater Bank) personnel were able to prevent the ransomware attack from being completed, hackers were able to gain access to sensitive consumer information. At this time, there is no indication that your information has been misused, but we recommend that you take precautions, including those outlined below, to mitigate the risk of identity theft or other misuse of your information.

Below, we provide more detailed information for you and respond to questions you may have regarding this matter.

What Happened?

Goldwater Bank believes that it was the subject of what appears to be an attempted ransomware attack on May 21, 2021. On that date, Goldwater Bank's IT vendor received alerts of unusual network activity and was able to quickly respond and stop the unauthorized access in process and prevent further infiltration. Goldwater Bank reported the event to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and has worked to investigate the event to determine what happened, what data was impacted, and who was responsible. Through our investigatory efforts, we identified a location where some of the impacted data was being stored and worked quickly to secure its removal. We have not received any evidence to date that any of the accessed data has been otherwise misused.

What Information Was Involved?

The files that were accessed included customer names and contact information as well as account information. The impacted information may include names, addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, account numbers, and tax identification numbers. At this time, we do not believe the passwords or log-in credentials for financial accounts were compromised.

What We Are Doing

Keeping your information confidential is one of our most important responsibilities. We are notifying you so that we may work together to protect your information. We have taken the following precautions:

- We conducted our own internal investigation to protect and minimize any financial impact to you.
- In addition to notifying individuals whose personal information may have been involved, we have thoroughly evaluated our existing cybersecurity infrastructure and processes.
- While we have a number of safeguards in place to protect information from unauthorized access, we are also always working to strengthen them so we can stay ahead of this type of threat activity.
- We are working with law enforcement to identify and pursue the responsible parties.
- As an additional measure of protection, Goldwater Bank has arranged for a complimentary one-year membership in an identity privacy protection service provided by IdentityForce. You will not be billed for this service. This product provides you with, among other things, advanced fraud monitoring, dark web monitoring, identity restoration services, and identity theft insurance. This service will expire at the conclusion of the complimentary period and will not automatically renew. Any renewal of service elected by the consumer is paid for by the customer and done directly through IdentityForce. To learn more about the complimentary membership and enroll, go to https://secure.identityforce.com/benefit/goldwater and enter the verification code provided below to complete enrollment.

Verification Code: <<VCode>>

What You Can Do

We recommend you take the following additional precautions to protect your personal and account information:

- Get your free credit reports from annualcreditreport.com. Check for any accounts or charges you don't recognize. You can order a free report from each of the three credit reporting companies once a year.
- Please promptly review your credit reports and account statements over the next 12 to 24 months and notify us of any unauthorized transactions or incidents of suspected identity theft related to your accounts with Goldwater Bank.
- If you ever suspect that you are the victim of identity theft or fraud, you can contact your local police.
- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you place a free fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. Contact any one of the three major credit bureaus. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. The initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You can renew it after one year.

- Equifax: equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services or 1-800-685-1111
- Experian: experian.com/help or 1-888-397-3742
- TransUnion: transunion.com/credit-help or 1-888-909-8872

- Ask each credit bureau to send you a free credit report after it places a fraud alert on your file. Review your credit reports for accounts and inquiries you don't recognize. These can be signs of identity theft.
- If your personal information has been misused, visit the FTC's site at IdentityTheft.gov to report the identity theft and get recovery steps. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the FTC recommends that you check your credit reports periodically so you can spot problems and address them quickly.
- You may also want to consider placing a free credit freeze. A credit freeze means potential creditors cannot get your credit report. That makes it less likely that an identity thief can open new accounts in your name. To place a freeze, contact each of the major credit bureaus at the links or phone numbers above. A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it.
- Try to file your taxes early before a scammer can. Tax identity theft happens when someone uses your Social Security number to get a tax refund or a job. Respond right away to letters from the IRS.
- If you wish to close your existing account and replace it with a new account number, please contact the Bank to do so.

If you have any questions regarding this incident or your accounts, please contact Goldwater Bank's dedicated response professionals toll-free at 800-476-5031.

This letter contains information about the incident and steps you can take to further protect your information.

What Happened:

On December 21, 2020, GMGS discovered that an employee's email account had been accessed by an unknown individual. After learning of the incident, GMGS engaged outside forensic experts to determine whether the incident resulted in the exposure of sensitive information. The forensic experts completed their investigation in February of 2021. GMGS then engaged a data review team to determine which individuals it needed to notify. At the end of June 2021, the data mining project confirmed that Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Heath Information (PHI) may have been exposed as a result of the unauthorized email compromise. GMGS then engaged in an extensive review of its files to locate contact information for the impacted population.

What Information Was Involved:

Personal data such as your name, Social Security Number, Drivers License number, date of birth, medical information, and health insurance information may have been viewed by an unauthorized individual. At this time, GMGS has no reason to believe that any patient PII has been misused as a result of this incident.

What We Are Doing:

GMGS takes the security of your personal information very seriously and has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future, including implementing multifactor authentication. In order to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have arranged for certain impacted individuals to enroll in complimentary credit monitoring.

This notice provides information about the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On or about December 4, 2020, Maxim Healthcare became aware of unusual activity related to several employees' email accounts. We immediately began to investigate to better understand the nature and scope of this activity. The preliminary investigation revealed that a limited number of employees' email accounts were accessed without authorization between October 1, 2020, and December 4, 2020. We worked with outside forensic specialists to determine the full scope and impact of this event. Unfortunately, the investigation was not able to determine exactly which email messages or attachments may have been accessed or viewed without authorization. In an abundance of caution, a detailed and thorough programmatic and manual review of the contents of the email accounts was performed to determine whether sensitive information was contained in the email messages or attachments at the time of the incident. Upon receiving the initial results of the review on August 24, 2021, Maxim Healthcare worked diligently to locate address information for the affected individuals and completed that effort on September 21, 2021.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation in this matter was unable to confirm whether information related to you was actually accessed or viewed by an unauthorized actor during this event. However, Maxim Healthcare is notifying you out of an abundance of caution. The information related to you that was potentially accessible within the impacted email accounts includes your name, address, and other data elements.

What We Are Doing

We take this incident and the security of personal information in our care seriously. Upon learning of the suspicious activity, Maxim Healthcare worked quickly to investigate and respond to this event, assess the security of relevant systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. As an immediate response, Maxim Healthcare instituted additional security protocols, including implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts and transitioned to a new Security Operations Center with advanced detection and response capabilities. Maxim is further committed to integrating additional cybersecurity infrastructure and security measures without negatively impacting the healthcare populations we serve.

Maxim Healthcare is notifying relevant state and federal regulators. We are also offering you access to complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services for 12 months through Experian. These services include fraud consultation and identity theft restoration services.

Monitor Your Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your credit reports/account statements and explanation of benefits forms for suspicious activity and to detect errors. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. Once you receive your credit report, review it for discrepancies and identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting bureau.

You have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a one-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any of the three credit reporting bureaus listed below. As an alternative to a fraud alert, you have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without your express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a credit freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Address for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (e.g., state driver's license or identification card); and

Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://response.idx.us/umgc and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your IDX identity protection membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, IDX will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact IDX at [TFN] to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in IDX identity protection, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the IDX website and filing a request for help.

If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly.

You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

VMRC immediately removed the phishing email from its server and began an investigation to determine whether any email boxes might have been compromised. VMRC's investigation revealed that 14 email boxes were compromised. After searching all emails contained within the compromised accounts, VMRC was able to determine whose personal health information may have been accessed or acquired by the unknown attacker/s.

VMRC has no evidence that the unknown attacker/s actually accessed, acquired, or misused the information. However, out of an abundance of caution, they are informing individuals whose personal health information may have been compromised so that they may take steps to protect their information and monitor their credit for any unusual activity.

The types of information potentially compromised include name, address, date of birth, unique state-issued client identifier number (UCI number), telephone number, personal email address, medical information such as diagnosis, medications, and other reports, and other potential unique identifier or dates related to services.

VMRC immediately removed the malicious phishing email from its server to prevent other email accounts from being compromised and prevent the application of malicious software. In addition, VMRC searched the impacted email boxes both manually and electronically to identify all emails that contained confidential personal health information.

VMRC is providing information on how individuals may protect their confidential information and monitor their credit. They recommend keeping a copy of the notice for future reference in case of any unusual activity involving the information. They also recommend visiting the privacy protection steps outlined in the Breach Help Consumer Tips from the California Attorney General and placing a fraud alert on credit files.

Individuals should review their account statements and credit reports closely and notify law enforcement of suspicious activity.

On July 12, 2021, Vitreo-Retinal Medical Group, Inc. d/b/a Retinal Consultants Medical Group and Northern California Advanced Surgery Center, LP (collectively Vitreo) experienced a service disruption that was determined to be caused by a sophisticated cyberattack. We immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this incident, working with outside cybersecurity specialists to securely restore our systems and to determine the full scope and impact of this event.

Unfortunately, the investigation was not able to determine exactly which files and folders stored on our network may have been accessed or viewed without authorization during the incident. In an abundance of caution, we performed a detailed and thorough review of the contents of the potentially accessed data to determine what, if any, sensitive information may have been accessible to the unauthorized actor at the time of the incident. Upon receiving the initial results of the review on October 19, 2021, Vitreo worked diligently to locate address information and assess notification obligations, and just recently completed that effort on October 25, 2021.

The investigation into this matter was unable to confirm whether information related to you was actually accessed or viewed by an unauthorized actor during this event. However, Vitreo is notifying you out of an abundance of caution.

On August 13, 2021, Cambro Manufacturing discovered suspicious activity involving certain company computer systems. We promptly took steps to secure the network and, with the assistance of third-party computer forensic specialists, conducted an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the event. The investigation revealed that an unauthorized actor had access to certain internal computer systems and acquired certain internal Cambro data around August 11, 2021. We identified these files and conducted a thorough review of each file to identify whether personal information was contained therein and to whom that information related. On or around October 15, 2021, after a thorough review, we determined that certain personal information related to you may have been contained in one or more of the involved files.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation determined that the following types of personal information related to you may have been contained in the involved files: your name and potentially your <<b2b_text_1(ImpactedData)>>.

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

Dear Full_Name:

We are writing to notify you that our recent data security incident may have had an impact on some of your personal information. This letter is being sent to provide you with additional information and to advise you of services Olympus Corporation of the Americas (OCA) is offering at no charge to you to help protect your continued privacy.

It is important to note that we have no evidence that your personal information has been used inappropriately, but we are sending this letter to tell you what happened, what information was potentially involved, what we have done and what you can do to protect your continued privacy.

Unfortunately, these types of incidents are becoming common. They are frustrating and disruptive to organizations like ours and our employees. Despite our regular monitoring, vigilance, and prevention measures, this incident occurred, and we are working hard to ensure this does not happen again.

What Happened?
On October 10, 2021, OCA discovered suspicious activity on its network system that we have since confirmed to be a data security incident. Our investigation revealed that an unauthorized third-party gained access to OCA systems, and certain files that contained confidential company and employee information were corrupted and rendered unavailable in an attempt to disrupt our systems. There is no evidence that any unauthorized person viewed or accessed the employee data. Nor is there any evidence that the employee data was taken from our system, is in the possession of any unauthorized person, or has been disclosed publicly or on the Internet. We will continue to monitor for any such disclosure and will promptly notify you if any of your personal information is disclosed or published in that way.

What Information Was Involved?
The corrupted files likely included personal information, such as your name, address, social security number/social insurance number, and details of your participation in OCAs retirement programs. While there is no evidence that the data has been accessed by an unauthorized person or used in an unauthorized way, we did want to make you aware of the situation out of an abundance of caution given the nature of this information.

What We Are Doing
Immediately upon learning of this incident, we launched an investigation and recovery effort with the assistance of cyber experts and law enforcement. Determining whether information was compromised in any way was one of the top priorities of this effort so that we could notify potentially affected individuals. Rest assured, we are also making increased efforts to improve our information security to prevent incidents like this from occurring in the future.

To help protect your identity, we have arranged to offer a complimentary two-year subscription to Experian IdentityWorksSM credit monitoring and identity theft protection. To activate your membership and start monitoring your credit and the use of your personal information:

RE: Notice of Data Privacy Matter

Dear Valued Patient,

We are writing to inform you of a recent matter involving your personal information. We take the privacy of personal information seriously, which is why we want to make you aware of this matter and the steps we are taking in response. There is no evidence that anyone has taken or misused your information as a result of this matter, and neither your financial information nor Social Security number were involved.

What Happened?

On October 5, 2021, Alcon sent an email to healthcare providers that, due to a technical error, included limited information about patients who recently received an Alcon intraocular lens implant. The email, which we sent to facilitate billing, should have only contained information about each healthcare provider's own patients. Instead, the communication inadvertently contained limited information about a broader set of patients who received an Alcon intraocular lens implant.

We are informing you of this matter because you recently received an Alcon intraocular lens implant, and your information was included in the communication sent to healthcare providers.

What Information Was Involved?

The information disclosed to healthcare providers was your first and last name, device serial number, date of implant, and treating physician. The communication did not include any other health or medical information or your financial information or Social Security number.

What We Are Doing.

Once we discovered that this email disclosure had occurred, we took immediate steps to correct the issue. We notified all of the healthcare providers who received the communication that they should delete the information that was inadvertently sent to them. We also immediately began reviewing our internal processes and procedures to determine the sources of the technical error and correct it.

What You Can Do.

We do not have reason to believe your personal information will be used inappropriately because of this matter. However, should you have any questions about this matter, please contact us using the information below.

For More Information.

Alcon is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. We deeply regret any inconvenience or concern this matter may have caused. If you have questions, please contact us at unbilled.implants@alcon.com.

Sincerely,

Sara Kelly

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear [INDIVIDUAL NAME]:

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know about a data security incident that may involve your personal information.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On or about September 26, 2020, bad actors injected a piece of malicious code into Diode Dynamics databases, exploiting a vulnerability in the e-commerce platform used by Diode Dynamics to process credit card transactions. Our investigation indicates that the malicious code was capable of reading information that customers entered in data fields in the payment processing area of our website and transmitting that information to the bad actors. The sophisticated nature of the malicious code allowed it to operate undetected, even though Diode Dynamics regularly runs security scans of its software using two separate, sophisticated scanning tools. Once Diode Dynamics became aware of this exploit, it moved quickly to have it removed from its website software, and the malicious code was completely removed on October 27, 2021.

This vulnerability did not affect purchases made by our customers using PayPal.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

The data accessed may have included personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and credit card numbers, expiration dates and security (CVV) codes.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

Diode Dynamics values your privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. Diode Dynamics is conducting a thorough review of the potentially affected systems and will notify you if there are any further significant developments. Diode Dynamics has implemented additional security measures designed to prevent a recurrence of such an attack and to protect the privacy of Diode Dynamics's valued customers.

Diode Dynamics also is working closely with major credit card suppliers and law enforcement to ensure the incident is properly addressed.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

Please also review the attachment to this letter (Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information) for further information on steps you can take to protect your information, and how to receive free [credit monitoring/identity theft protection] services for one year.

FOR MORE INFORMATION

For further information and assistance, please contact Diode Dynamics at (314) 205-3033 between 10:00 a.m.- 5:00 p.m. CST daily or visit http://www.diodedynamics.com.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Security Freeze

In some US states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. A security freeze (also known as a credit freeze) makes it harder for someone to open a new account in your name. It is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to apply for a new credit card, wireless phone, or any service that requires a credit check. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. To place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement. [There is no charge to request a security freeze or to remove a security freeze. /There is a charge of [$] to request or remove a security freeze.]

We are writing to inform you of an inadvertent and limited incident involving the unauthorized disclosure of a spreadsheet containing some personal information of a group of current and former employees that was emailed to certain internal company distribution lists. The spreadsheet included some of your personal information. We want you to understand what happened and the steps we have taken to address the inadvertent disclosure. Although we have no reason to believe that any misuse of the information included on the spreadsheet has or will occur, we have set forth ways for you to protect your personal information. We regret this mistake and have included in this letter instructions on how to enroll in complimentary credit and identity monitoring services.

What Happened

On October 29, 2021, an employee inadvertently sent an email to certain internal distribution lists which attached a spreadsheet that included personal information of a group of current and former Quest Diagnostics employees. Upon realizing the email had been sent in error, the employee promptly took steps to recall the email and notified the IT team, who immediately took steps to contain the issue, administratively removing the email and spreadsheet from recipients' email systems and computers. The IT, HR, Legal, and Compliance teams also took steps to track and confirm permanent deletion of any emails that may have been forwarded by recipients.

What Information Was Involved

Based on the investigation, we determined that some of your personal information was included in the spreadsheet, including your first and last name, Social Security Number, and employee ID number. For some individuals, a personal email address may have appeared on the spreadsheet as well.

What We Are Doing

We are writing to inform you that Statewide Safety System (Statewide), which includes Statewide Traffic Safety and Signs, Inc, Safety Systems and Signs Hawaii, Inc., Maneri Sign Co., Inc., Altus Traffic Management, LLC, and Traffic Solutions Corporation, experienced a cybersecurity incident that affected some of your personal information. We engaged leading outside security experts to assist with our investigation and have implemented additional information security measures to enhance our safeguards. We also notified law enforcement of the incident.

On April 14, 2021, Statewide discovered it was the victim of a ransomware attack. Cyber criminals were able to acquire certain files from our systems that contained personal information about our current and former employees, business contacts, and others. In limited cases, the files contained information about our employees' beneficiaries and dependents. Statewide took immediate efforts to contain and mitigate the cyberattack. We also launched an extensive investigation to determine what personal information was impacted as a result of the incident.

If you are receiving this letter, Statewide has determined that you are part of the group of individuals whose personal information was impacted. The impacted records contained certain personal information such as name, contact information, date of birth, government-issued ID (such as Social Security number, tax ID, and drivers license, and passport numbers), financial account numbers, and medical information. Not all of this information was affected for each impacted individual.

Statewide is committed to ensuring the security of all personal information in its control. As mentioned above, upon discovery of this incident Statewide took immediate steps to contain the incident, conducted a thorough forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident, and made efforts to mitigate all potential harms. We are alerting you about this incident so you can take steps to help protect your information.

Statewide encourages you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review account statements, and to monitor credit reports for suspicious or unauthorized activity. Additionally, security experts suggest individuals to contact his/her financial institution and major credit bureaus to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on credit files. Statewide also cautions you to never assume an email message requesting that you provide account credentials via a link in an email is legitimate.

As a precautionary measure, Statewide is providing each potentially impacted employee with a complimentary 12-month membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM. To activate your membership and start monitoring your personal information, please follow the steps below:

Ensure that you enroll by: <<b2b_text_6(Activation deadline)>> (Your code will not work after this date.)

What You Should Do To Protect Your Personal Information

We recommend you remain vigilant and consider taking one or more of the following steps to protect your personal information:

1. We recommend you closely monitor your financial accounts and access resources concerning identity theft, such as information the Internal Revenue Services has published at: http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Identity-Protection, and well as https://www.irs.gov/uac/Taxpayer-Guide-to-Identity-Theft.

2. Contact the nationwide credit-reporting agencies as soon as possible to:

Add a fraud alert statement or security freeze to your credit file at all three national credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You only need to contact one of the three agencies listed below; your request will be shared with the other two agencies. This fraud alert will remain on your credit file for 90 days.

Remove your name from mailing lists of pre-approved offers of credit for approximately six months.

Obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.annualcreditreport.com.

3. We also recommend that you review or change all email and bank account login information that may have been affected. Please review all bills and credit card statements closely to determine whether you have been charged for items you did not contract for or purchase. Review all of your bank account statements frequently for checks, purchases, or deductions not made by you. Note that even if you do not find suspicious activity initially, you should continue to check this information periodically since identity thieves sometimes delay their use of stolen personal information.

4. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers consumer assistance and educational materials relating to identity theft, privacy issues, and how to avoid identity theft. You can also obtain information from the FTC about fraud alerts and security freezes. You may contact the FTC by visiting www.ftc.gov or www.consumer.gov/idtheft, calling (877) 438-4338, or writing to the FTC at the address below.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<Name 1>>,

We are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have affected the security of your personal information. On January 26, 2021, we became aware of suspicious activity related to email accounts. We worked with third-party forensic investigators to investigate the nature and scope of the activity and determined that an unauthorized actor downloaded information from some PUC email accounts. After conducting a thorough assessment of the information contained within the accounts, we confirmed on September 10, 2021, that your name and <<Breached Elements>> were subject to unauthorized access.

Although we are unaware of any actual or attempted malicious use of your information as a result of this incident, we take the security of data we hold very seriously, and are notifying you out of an abundance of caution. We have secured the compromised accounts and taken additional steps to improve security and better protect against similar incidents in the future. In an abundance of caution, we are also notifying potentially affected individuals, including you, so that you may take further steps to best protect your personal information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors over the next 12 to 24 months. We have arranged to have Equifax protect your identity for 12 months at no cost to you as an added precaution.

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)
2. Social Security number
3. Date of birth
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, etc.)
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

Re: Notice of data breach

Dear <<First Name>><<Last Name>> ,

Utah Imaging Associates, Inc. (UIA) is writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have resulted in an unauthorized access to your sensitive personal information. At this time, we are unaware of any fraudulent misuse of your personal information. However, we take the security of your personal information seriously and wanted to provide you with details about the incident, steps we are taking in response, and resources available to help you protect against the potential misuse of your information.

What Happened and What Information was Involved?

On September 4, 2021, UIA detected and stopped a network security incident. Upon discovery of this incident, UIA promptly secured and began remediating our network. UIA also engaged a specialized third-party cybersecurity firm to conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. The forensic investigation has found evidence that some UIA files containing sensitive data were available to the unauthorized actor during the incident.

This letter serves to notify you that it is possible the following information related to you, if provided to UIA, may have been exposed to the unauthorized party: first and last name; mailing address; date of birth; Social Security number; health insurance policy number; medical information, including, but not limited to, medical treatment, diagnosis, and prescription information. We maintained this information for patient care and administrative purposes. Notably, the types of information affected varied by individual, and not every individual had every element exposed.

As of this writing, UIA has not received any reports of related identity theft since the date of the incident (September 4, 2021 to present).

What We Are Doing

To [Insert Customer First & Last Name or Company Name]:

We write to inform you about a recent data security incident that involves some of your personal and/or business information. You are receiving this letter as a customer of ACE Surgical Supply Company, Inc. We take the protection of your information very seriously, and we are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident, the steps we are taking in response, and the resources we will make available to you.

What Happened?

On Tuesday, June 29, 2021, we discovered that certain company files were accessed without authorization in a cyberattack. Upon discovering this incident, we began an investigation to understand the scope of the incident, secured the Company's information technology systems, and contacted law enforcement. More recently, in or about September 2021, as part of our continuing investigation, we discovered that certain files related to you and/or your business may have been obtained without authorization. While we know the files were compromised, as of this time, we do not have any evidence that the information in those files has been made public or that any identity theft fraud has been committed to date.

What Information Was Involved?

Protecting your personal and business information is of utmost concern to us. As of now, we believe the affected customer information that may have been obtained without authorization included Assessment Questionnaire Practitioner Forms, which contained individual and/or business names, contact information, and DEA and physician state license numbers.

What We Are Doing To Protect Your Information:

Please be assured that we have taken numerous steps to address the incident. Upon discovery of the breach, our cybersecurity team immediately took a series of actions, including a forensic investigation to confirm that no other company systems were impacted and to better understand the nature of the event.

Dear <<Name 1>>,

We value our customers and respect the privacy of your information. As a precautionary measure, we are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may involve your personal information.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On September 28th, 2021, we experienced outages and discovered that our company was the victim of a ransomware attack. Some of our computer systems were compromised and encrypted. A forensic investigation revealed that a cybercriminal gained access to portions of our computer system and deployed various network reconnaissance and ransomware tools to gain access to portions of the system, rendering them inaccessible to us. We have since restored our data from separate backup servers. The cybercriminal also informed us that they retained copies of much of the data and threatened to leak the information, which could make it available to other cybercriminals.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

Subsequent analysis of the incident indicates that the data accessed by the unauthorized third party included contact information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Additionally, drivers license numbers, social security numbers, passport numbers, or other identification numbers were also accessed.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

Pawn America values your privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. We have conducted a review of the potentially affected records and computer system, which is ongoing. We will notify you if there are any significant developments. We are working with cybersecurity experts to remove any remnants of this incident from our systems and improve our security.

Monitor Your Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your credit reports/account statements and explanation of benefits forms for suspicious activity and to detect errors. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. Once you receive your credit report, review it for discrepancies and identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting bureau.

You have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a one-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any of the three credit reporting bureaus listed below. As an alternative to a fraud alert, you have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without your express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a credit freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Address for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (e.g., state driver's license or identification card); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft, if you are a victim of identity theft.

Subject Line: Important Security Notification

Dear [Insert First Name, Last Name],

Astoria Company (Astoria) investigated a cyber attack and found that a third party may have obtained personal information about you. We are therefore providing notice to you of this event.

Who is Astoria?
Astoria Company operates a lead exchange, connecting consumers with the products and services they seek in near real-time across multiple industries. This includes processing customer information in connection with expressed interest in obtaining an auto loan, mortgage, or other financial service. As a result, we maintain contact details and other personal information about individuals even if they have no direct relationships with us.

What happened?
The following description is based on Astoria's investigation to date: In late January 2021, an alleged security researcher, along with an associate, gained unauthorized access to an Astoria system which had a database of individuals' personal information. The two individuals were able to obtain a portion of personal information maintained by the system, although the system prevented attempts to obtain further data. Astoria became aware of the intrusion on Feb 8, 2021, and took immediate steps to secure its systems and conduct an internal forensic investigation to determine what information was accessed during the intrusion. After many months of work, Astoria was able to obtain a copy of the data obtained by the security researcher and compare it with Astoria's records. In an abundance of caution, Astoria is now notifying all individuals who were identified as potentially having sensitive data obtained during the incident. Additional technical details about the cyber attack are currently posted at https://astoriacompany.com/cyberupdate/.

Who was affected by this incident?
The impacted information included first and last name, mailing address, email address, phone number, date of birth, social security number and/or driver's license number and state, and in some instances employment information.

What are we doing to protect your information?
Astoria is implementing additional security measures to enhance the continued security of information in its care, and the incident has been reported to the FBI.

Additional resources for protecting your personal information.
(1) Getting a credit report. Under U.S. law, individuals over the age of 18 are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. To order a free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of their credit report.
(2) Placing a fraud alert. If you believe you are at risk of identity theft, you can have the credit bureaus place a fraud alert on their credit file that alerts creditors to take additional steps prior to granting credit in your name. Note, however, that this may delay your ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies your identity. As soon as one credit bureau confirms the fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts as well.

You cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report.

What Happened?

ON24 experienced a security incident in June 2021, which impacted some internal systems and data. Upon detecting the incident, ON24 immediately launched an investigation.

What Information Was Involved?

The information impacted varies by individual and may have exposed your name, address, date of birth, Social Security Number, health insurance and benefits enrollment information, as well as beneficiary and dependent names and information.

What We Are Doing

Protecting your personal information is of paramount importance to ON24. Upon detecting the incident, we notified law enforcement. The monitoring and security systems we had in place enabled us to quickly identify and respond to the incident. We quickly took steps to contain and mitigate any impact by taking certain systems offline and engaging outside cybersecurity experts to help remediate and ensure the ongoing security of our systems. Further, since identifying the incident, ON24 has also deployed additional security, monitoring, and management solutions.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Subject: Notice of Security Incident Affecting Your GoDaddy Managed WordPress Service

Dear [Name],

We regret to inform you that a security incident has occurred that affects your GoDaddy Managed WordPress hosting service. On November 17, we detected suspicious activity in our WordPress hosting environment and immediately launched an investigation with the assistance of a third-party IT forensics firm. We have also contacted law enforcement. Our investigation is ongoing, but we have determined that an unauthorized third party gained access to certain authentication information for administrative services on or about September 6, 2021. Specifically, this includes your customer number, email address associated with your account, WordPress Admin login set at inception, and your sFTP and database usernames and passwords.

This means that the unauthorized party could have accessed your Managed WordPress service and made changes to it, including altering your website and the content stored on it. The exposure of your email address may also present a heightened risk of phishing attacks. We are taking several steps to protect you and your data. First, we have blocked the unauthorized third party from our systems. Second, we have rotated your WordPress Admin login credentials, sFTP password, and your database password. Your website is still up and running, but you won't be able to edit content until you reset your passwords.

Here are the instructions on how to reset each password:

- WordPress Admin Login: https://www.godaddy.com/help/a-26916
- sFTP or data password: https://www.godaddy.com/help/a-40804
- WordPress database password: https://www.godaddy.com/help/a-24573

If you use the same password for other accounts, we recommend that you change your password to those accounts and adopt data security best practices, such as choosing a strong unique password, regularly changing it, and enabling multi-factor authentication where available. We also recommend that you remain vigilant for potentially fraudulent communications sent to your email address purporting to be from GoDaddy or other third parties.

Finally, because the private key of your existing Managed WordPress SSL certificate was exposed, the certificate will need to be revoked. We are in the process of installing a free DV SSL certificate on your website for one year to minimize potential site downtime. If you would like to continue using your existing SSL certificate product, please follow the directions below to rekey a new certificate: https://www.godaddy.com/help/rekey-my-certificate-4976.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please call 480-505-8870. For residents living in California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming, please visit https://www.godaddy.com/help/a-41004 for additional resources that describe additional steps you can take to help protect your information, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.

Thank you,

Demetrius Comes
Chief Information Security Officer	The explanation provides clear indication of a suspicious party gaining unauthorized access to login credentials on GoDaddy's WordPress hosting environment.

RE: Notice of Security Incident

Dear First Name Middle Name Last Name,

Lincare Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary companies (collectively, Lincare) value and respect the privacy and security of patient personal information, which is why it is notifying you of a recent security incident that may have involved the disclosure of certain personal information. This letter contains information regarding the incident, the measures Lincare has taken since the incident, and steps you can take to further protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On September 26, 2021, Lincare identified unusual activity on certain systems within its network. Lincare took immediate action after learning of the incident to secure its network and launched an investigation, including working with outside cybersecurity experts to determine the source of the activity and potential impact on Lincare's network. The investigation confirmed that certain systems may have first been accessed on September 10, 2021. The unauthorized access was blocked by September 29, 2021. A comprehensive review of all potentially impacted data has commenced and remains ongoing. This review includes a manual review of the data to identify any potential personal information.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation determined that the incident may have resulted in unauthorized access to your personal information including <<Data Elements>>. We are also not aware of any misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

What We Are Doing.

We are committed to protecting your information. Although we are not aware of any misuse of your information as a result of this incident, out of an abundance of caution, we are offering you complimentary credit monitoring through Kroll. These services will be available to you for one year at no cost to you in order to give you peace of mind. This letter contains additional information regarding these services and instructions on how you may enroll. You must complete the enrollment steps listed in this letter.

We take the protection and proper use of personal information very seriously. We took steps to launch an investigation immediately after identifying the incident, enlisted outside cybersecurity experts to assist in the investigation, and notified law enforcement of the incident. We also promptly reset all user passwords to block any unauthorized access and are implementing additional technological safeguards on our systems that contain personal information to minimize the possibility of an incident like this from occurring in the future. This letter also includes additional information and resources to assist you in protecting your personal information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What You Can Do.

We are aware of how important personal information is to patients and their loved ones. We recommend that you activate your complimentary credit monitoring services with Kroll. As a best practice, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review all claims information from your health insurance provider, and to monitor your credit reports and financial statements for suspicious activity. You can also report any suspicious activity to the credit bureaus at the numbers listed below in this letter. We also recommend that you review the information we are enclosing in this letter about steps you can take to help protect your personal information as you deem appropriate.

We will keep this page updated with actions we are taking, including free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for those whose personal information was potentially accessed.

What happened?

On August 6, 2021, DNA Diagnostics Center, Inc. (DDC) detected potential unauthorized access to its network, during which there was unauthorized access and acquisition of an archived database that contained personal information collected between 2004 and 2012. The impacted database was associated with a national genetic testing organization system that DDC acquired in 2012. This system has never been used in DDC's operations and has not been active since 2012.

Therefore, impacts from this incident are not associated with DDC. However, impacted individuals may have had their information, such as Social Security number or payment information, impacted as a result.

Upon learning of this issue, DDC proactively contained and secured the threat and executed a prompt and thorough investigation in consultation with third-party cybersecurity professionals. DDC has also coordinated closely with law enforcement following the discovery of this incident.

Our investigation determined that the unauthorized individual(s) potentially removed certain files and folders from portions of our database between May 24, 2021 and July 28, 2021. DDC has been and remains fully operational, and the systems and databases that are actively used by DDC were not infiltrated.

The in-depth investigation concluded on October 29, 2021, and DDC has begun notifying individuals potentially affected by this incident.

How will you know if you were impacted?

If you know you have received a relationship test from DDC directly, this incident did not affect that test, as the information was acquired from an archived system that was never used by DDC.

Individuals whose personal information was potentially accessed are being notified in accordance with state regulations, and out of an abundance of caution to protect against identity fraud, DDC is providing a complimentary membership of Experian credit monitoring to eligible individuals.

If you received a relationship test as a part of court proceedings or independent, individual testing between 2004 and 2012 but have not received a mailed letter from DDC regarding this incident, please contact 1-855-604-1656 as you may be eligible for complimentary credit monitoring services through Experian.

What is DDC doing?

DDC has taken steps, in coordination with its third-party cybersecurity experts, to regain possession of this personal information and ensure its safekeeping. DDC is not aware of any reports of identity fraud or improper use of the information.

Additionally, out of an abundance of caution, we are offering free credit monitoring for impacted individuals to protect against identity fraud. Ensuring the safety and security of the personal information entrusted to us remains our primary responsibility, and we will continue to work with third-party experts to harden our cybersecurity defenses.

If you have any further questions regarding this incident, please call our dedicated and confidential toll-free response line that we have set up to respond to questions at 1-855-604-1656. The response line is available Monday through Friday 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time, excluding U.S. Holidays.

STEPS INDIVIDUALS CAN TAKE TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION:

1. Placing a Fraud Alert	The unauthorized individual(s) potentially removed certain files and folders from portions of the database between May 24, 2021 and July 28, 2021, demonstrating that this incident was a hack involving an outside party.

What Happened?

On December 10, 2020, we identified a data security incident that resulted in the encryption of certain systems within our environment. We addressed the incident, made upgrades to certain aspects of our computer security, restored the impacted systems from recent backups, and resumed normal operation. We believed at the time that the incident was fully contained and did not find any evidence that information had been exfiltrated from our environment. On May 24, 2021, we were made aware that certain information had been exfiltrated from our environment by an unauthorized person. We immediately launched an investigation, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist.

What Information Was Involved?

We cannot confirm specifically what information, if any, was viewed by the unauthorized person. However, on August 24, 2021, the investigation confirmed that the information present on our systems at the time of the incident (i.e., information that was accessed by the unauthorized person) included your full name and Social Security number.

What We Are Doing?

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. We have strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon learning of the incident, and to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we have taken steps to confirm and further strengthen the security of our systems, including deploying SentinelOne Endpoint Detection & Response software on the computers in our environment, upgrading our filtering capabilities to block traffic from malicious sources, establishing and reviewing permissions for secure file share portals, resetting user passwords, and transferring sensitive data to cloud storage. We also continue to educate our employees on cybersecurity best practices.

We are notifying individuals whose information was involved, including you, so that you may take further steps to protect your personal information should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Can You Do?

As a precautionary measure, we also secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring services at no cost to you for one (1) year.

We are writing to inform you of an incident involving some of your information. This letter explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you may consider taking in response.

What Happened
On October 17, 2021, we identified suspicious activity on our computer network. We immediately took our systems offline, notified law enforcement, and a third-party cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist in our investigation. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to our network between October 9, 2021, and October 17, 2021, and exfiltrated some files from our systems during that time.

What Information Was Involved
As soon as we determined what files were involved, we began a review to determine what they contained. On November 4, 2021, we identified files that contained your name and one or more of the following: address, insurance information, date of birth, and clinical information, such as diagnosis, procedure, and/or prescription information.

What You Can Do

However, in an abundance of caution, we wanted to notify you of this incident and assure you that we take this very seriously. It is always a good idea to review statements you receive from your health insurer and healthcare providers.

We regret to inform you that some of your personal information stored by Keolis Transit America (KTA), a subsidiary of Keolis North America (KNA), may have been accessed without authorization. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and are taking swift action to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. We take the protection of your information very seriously.

On or around May 23, 2021, two individuals not affiliated with Keolis found a thumb drive labeled with Keolis in a laundromat. They viewed several files on the thumb drive, noticed human resources information, and promptly contacted Keolis. The company collected the thumb drive. The files on the thumb drive included spreadsheets containing personal information for current and former employees, including name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, financial account information, and/or limited medical information (pregnancy status, as reflected in requests for leave under the Family Medical Leave Act, or COVID test results). While we believe that there is a low likelihood of misuse of your personal information under these circumstances, we are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution.

To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228.

Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. Once you receive your credit report, review it for discrepancies and identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting bureau.

You have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a one-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert lasting seven years.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, you have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without your express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a credit freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Address for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility or telephone bill;

Re: Notice of a Data Security Incident

(Please read this letter in its entirety)

Dear [NAME]:

We are writing to notify you that an unauthorized third-party accessed our computer network, which contained your personal information. With the help of professional security experts, we are doing everything we can to limit the potential adverse consequences of this security incident. We would like to provide you with one year of complimentary credit and fraud monitoring services, as well as identity theft insurance at no cost. Enrollment instructions are provided with this letter.

What Happened

On or around the end of April 2021, we were alerted that malware had been downloaded to a computer that contained your personal information for the purpose of filing tax returns. As a result, we immediately took steps to remediate the situation and remove the malware. A thorough investigation of what happened was then conducted. Based on the review of the situation and an examination of the affected data, personal data belonging to you was potentially exposed to the unauthorized intruder. We are therefore taking appropriate precautionary measures to ensure your financial security and help alleviate concerns you may have.

What Information Was Involved

The affected data included personal information, including but not limited to names, account numbers, associated contact information, and Social Security numbers.

What We Are Doing

We have made immediate enhancements to my systems, security, and practices. Additionally, we have engaged appropriate experts to assist in conducting a full review of my security practices and systems to ensure that appropriate security protocols are in place going forward. We are committed to helping those people who may have been impacted by this unfortunate situation.

In addition, we are providing you with access to the following services:

Access to Triple Bureau Credit Monitoring/Triple Bureau Credit Report/Triple Bureau Credit Score/Cyber Monitoring * services at no charge. These services provide you with alerts for twelve months from the date of enrollment when changes occur to any of one of your Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion credit files. This notification is sent to you the same day that the change or update takes place with the bureau. The cyber monitoring will review the dark web and alert you if your personally identifiable information is found online.

In addition, we are providing you with proactive fraud assistance to help with any questions that you might have.

* Services marked with an * require an internet connection and email account and may not be available to minors under the age of 18 years of age. Please note that when signing up for monitoring services, you may be asked to verify personal information for your own protection to confirm your identity.

Error! Unknown document property name.

To enroll in Credit Monitoring * services at no charge, please log on to https://www.myidmanager.com and follow the instructions provided. When prompted please provide the following unique code to receive services: < CODE HERE.> In order for you to receive the monitoring services described above, you must enroll within 90 days from the date of this letter.

To extend these services, enrollment in the monitoring services described below is required.

What You Can Do

You are encouraged to remain vigilant against fraud and identity theft, including over the next twelve to twenty-four months, by regularly reviewing your financial account statements and monitoring credit reports for suspicious activity, and to immediately report any unauthorized charges to the card issuer. The phone number to call is usually on the back of the credit or debit card. Any incidents of suspected identity theft may be reported to financial institutions and law enforcement, including the Federal Trade Commission. Under U.S. law you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus.

You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report at no cost or charge, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who may access the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or to lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, or to obtain a free copy of your credit report, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies.

If you choose to place a fraud alert on your own, you will need to contact one of the three major credit agencies directly at:

What Happened?
On July 16, 2021, we identified a disruption within our network and learned that an unknown third party had accessed our computer network. Upon identifying the issue, we promptly initiated an internal investigation and hired a leading computer forensics firm to examine our network and to confirm the security of our computer systems.

However, we identified that they were able to access and acquire certain files on our network for the time period between July 13 and July 16. Although we are not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft resulting from the incident, we conducted an internal review to determine the contents of the documents accessible to the unknown third party.

What Information Was Involved?
On September 7, 2021, we determined that the impacted information included your name, address, social security number, and financial account number.

What We Are Doing?
In addition to restoring the affected systems and conducting an investigation into how the incident occurred, we have taken steps to reduce the risk of this type of incident occurring in the future, including implementing additional technical controls.

Allergy Partners, PLLC takes the confidentiality and security of the information we maintain seriously. Unfortunately, we are writing to inform you of an incident involving some of that information.

On February 23, 2021, we identified unusual network activity. We immediately took steps to secure the network and began an investigation with the assistance of a computer forensic firm. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to our network between January 12, 2021, and February 23, 2021, and, during that time, deployed malware and acquired copies of some of the documents on our systems.

Over the past several months, we have been working diligently to complete an extensive review of the documents involved; we received the final results on October 1, 2021. The review determined that one or more files reflected your name, Social Security number, and/or driver's license number.

We have no indication that any of your information has been misused. However, in an abundance of caution, we wanted to notify you of this incident to assure you that we take this matter very seriously.

Please note that the information contained herein is deemed to be confidential, non-public, and privileged. By sharing this information with your Office, SG does not intend to waive any such confidentiality or privilege that may attach. SG respectfully requests that your Office designate and treat this information as confidential and refrain from sharing this information with any third parties. SG trusts the confidential information contained in this response demonstrates that SG has taken prompt and effective action to address this incident.

1. Nature of the Incident

On July 18, 2021, SG became aware of a ransomware incident that impacted all of its systems and created a substantial disruption of SG's operations. With the assistance of a specialized cybersecurity firm, SG began working to resume business activities and conducted a forensic investigation to attempt to determine the full nature and scope of this incident. While in the process of investigating, SG experienced another ransomware incident on September 18, 2021, carried out by a different threat actor. In both instances, SG terminated the unauthorized access and promptly commenced an investigation to determine the scope of the incidents. In order to resume business and to mitigate any further issues, SG wiped its systems. The result of doing so was that many digital artifacts were lost and unavailable for analysis. A forensics investigation was conducted.

Due to lack of artifacts to analyze, the investigation was inconclusive as to whether the threat groups accessed or exfiltrated any data stored on SG's systems. SG worked to determine what type of data was stored on its systems and who this data belonged to. SG reviewed the records for all of its programs to determine anyone whose sensitive information could have been stored on any of its systems. It was determined that data was stored for SG's clients, employees, vendors, donors, and volunteers. Given the significant notice population, SG has worked to obtain names and addresses in order to provide direct written notice for as many potentially impacted individuals as possible. The investigation concluded on November 9, 2021. Out of an abundance of caution, SG notified all individuals potentially impacted by the incident.

The type of information potentially impacted varies by the individual's relationship with SG. For each subset of the population, they have received individualized letters to explain what information may have been in scope. For SG clients, the information potentially impacted includes name, address, phone number, email, date of birth, whether or not its clients have health insurance, health insurance number, and for clients who provided the information to SG, health history or condition. For SG employees, the information potentially impacted includes name, phone number, address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license and/or state-issued identification card number, passport number, military identification number, medical information, health insurance information, health insurance policy numbers, digitized or electronic signature, financial aid information, and financial account numbers. For SG volunteers, the information potentially impacted includes name, address, phone number, email, date of birth, and driver's license number. For SG donors, the information potentially impacted includes name, address, phone number, email, date of birth, and donation history. For SG vendors, the information potentially impacted includes name, phone number, address, Social Security number, or Tax Identification number. As of this writing, SG has not received any reports of related identity theft since following the above-referenced events.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

SG identified and notified 600,605 individuals potentially affected by this Incident. Of those, 669 were residents of Iowa. Notification letters to these individuals were mailed between	Insufficient information has been presented about the breach to classify it as any of the breach types listed. The information provided only mentions that Sound Generations, a non-profit organization that provides services to older adults and adults with disabilities in King County, Washington, experienced two ransomware incidents in July and September 2021. An investigation was conducted to determine the scope of the incidents and the type of data stored on its systems, but it was inconclusive due to the lack of artifacts. The investigation concluded on November 9, 2021, and SG notified potentially impacted individuals, including 669 residents of Iowa. The type of information potentially impacted varies by the individual's relationship with SG. However, no information was provided on how the data was breached or lost, so a breach type cannot be determined with the available information.

What Happened?

On July 17, 2021, MGRC discovered unauthorized activity on its systems by an unknown actor. In response, we took the systems offline to stop the unauthorized access and worked with our cybersecurity experts to further examine the incident. All services have since been restored, and the incident caused minimal disruption to our customer operations. Since then, we have been working diligently to assess what information may have been impacted. On November 15, 2021, MGRC determined that the data involved included information relating to you. We have no indication that any information has been misused as a result of this incident. Nevertheless, we wanted to inform you of the incident and provide steps you can take to help protect your information.

What Information Was Involved?

The files that may have been accessed by the unauthorized individual generally contained the following information: names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security or individual tax identification numbers, drivers license or other government issued identification card numbers, health-related information, health insurance policy or member numbers, financial account information, and fingerprints. Please note that the information affected varied from person-to-person.

What Are We Doing?

As soon as we discovered the incident, we took the steps described above. We also reported the incident to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and will provide whatever cooperation is necessary to help identify and prosecute the perpetrators. In addition, we have secured the services of IDX to provide identity protection services at no cost to you. IDX is a risk mitigation and response vendor and has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Personal Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity: As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Copy of Credit Report: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print this form at www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf. You also can contact one of the following three national credit reporting agencies:

Fraud Alert: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze: You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security Number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources: You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have involved your personal information on MyTopo.com.

What you can do?

We are notifying you so you can take immediate action to protect your personal information. If you use a common password between MyTopo.com and other websites, please change your password on those websites immediately. Once the MyTopo systems are restored and secured, you will be prompted to create a new password on the MyTopo site. As a best practice, we recommend that you remain vigilant and promptly report to us and to the proper law enforcement authorities any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft.

What Happened?

On or about November 1, 2021, we became aware that our network may have been subject to unauthorized access. We immediately began an investigation, which included working with third-party specialists to determine the full nature and scope of the activity. Our investigation is ongoing; however, we were able to determine that certain segments of our network may have been accessed during the incident. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we conducted a review of the contents of the potentially impacted network locations to determine the type of information contained therein and to whom the information related.

On December 10, 2021, we determined that files containing certain current and former employee information were present in the potentially impacted network locations. To date, the investigation has not revealed any evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information as a result of this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation revealed that the information potentially impacted included your first and last name, as well as your Social Security number, medical information, and financial account information.

What We Are Doing.

In response to this incident, we changed account passwords and enhanced security protocols. We are working with third-party specialists to harden our network and are reviewing our policies and procedures related to data protection. Our investigation into this incident remains ongoing.

What You Can Do.

As previously stated, to date, we have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information as a result of this incident. However, in an abundance of caution, we are providing you access to 12 months of credit monitoring and identity protection services through Cyberscout at no cost to you. Instructions about how to enroll in these services and additional resources available to you are included in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information.

Monitor Your Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your credit reports/account statements for suspicious activity and to detect errors. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. Once you receive your credit report, review it for discrepancies and identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting bureau.

You have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a one-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any of the three credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, you have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without your express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a credit freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Address for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (e.g., state driver's license or identification card); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft, if you are a victim of identity theft.

We are writing to inform you of an incident that involves some of your information. The City of Sebastopol recognizes the importance of protecting the information we maintain. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken in response, and some additional steps you may consider taking in response.

What Happened?

We recently completed an investigation that involved unauthorized access to an employee's email account. Upon discovery of the incident, we immediately took steps to secure the account and launched an investigation. A cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with the investigation and determined that an unauthorized party was able to access the employee's email account between April 28, 2021, and May 11, 2021. The investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized party. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive review of the contents of the email account to determine the specific individuals whose information was contained within the email and attachments. We analyzed the results and determined that an email or attachment in the account included some of your information.

What Information Was Involved?

The information that may have been accessed includes your name, Social Security number, driver's license number, financial account information, and/or health information.

What We Are Doing:

To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we have implemented additional measures to enhance our existing security protocols. As a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership in Experian's IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B. This product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorks Credit 3B is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on IdentityWorks Credit 3B, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided with this letter.

What You Can Do:

We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

For More Information:

We regret this incident occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. If you have any questions, please call 855-604-1698 Monday through Friday from 9 am to 9 pm Eastern Time.

Additional Steps You Can Take:

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity over the next 12 to 24 months. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com

TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com

Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	The unauthorized access to an employee's email account by an outside party constitutes a hacking data breach.
Insufficient information	There is no information available on the type of breach, only the name of the organization and a missing description.
Insufficient information	There is not enough information provided to determine the type of breach.
Insufficient information	Insufficient information provided to make a determination about the type of breach.

Information on Security Freezes

In addition to a fraud alert, you may place a security freeze on your credit file. A security freeze will block a credit bureau from releasing information from your credit report without your prior written authorization. Please be aware that it may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. The fees for placing a security freeze vary by state, and a consumer reporting agency may charge a fee of up to $10.00 to place a freeze or lift or remove a freeze.

To place a security freeze on your credit report, you may send a written request to each of the major consumer reporting agencies by regular, certified, or overnight mail. You can also place security freezes online by visiting each consumer reporting agency online.

UpHealth, Inc.	The breach involved an unauthorized third party accessing personal information and protected health information (PHI) by hacking into Innovations Group, Inc.'s (IGIs) servers. There was a forensic investigation that confirmed the breach started on October 27, 2021, and that IGIs servers were only secured on October 30, 2021.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Cyber Incident

Anderson McPharlin & Conners LLP (AMC) experienced a cybersecurity incident on June 24, 2021, that may have resulted in the disclosure of certain individuals' personal information. This notice is intended to alert those individuals of the Incident and steps they can take to protect themselves.

What Happened?

On June 24, 2021, AMC experienced a network intrusion that resulted in the encryption of information stored on its computer systems. Upon discovery of the Incident, AMC immediately terminated access to its environment and took steps to secure its systems before bringing them back online.

AMC also engaged a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensics investigation of the Incident to determine the nature and scope of the attack and the potential compromise of sensitive information stored on AMC's systems. The investigation concluded on August 26, 2021, and determined that an unauthorized party had access to data stored on AMC's information systems.

Thereafter, AMC conducted an internal investigation in an attempt to identify those individuals whose personally identifiable information (PII) may have been compromised as a result of the Incident. However, due to the number of affected files potentially containing PII and lack of complete contact information for all individuals, AMC is providing substitute notice of the Incident pursuant to applicable law.

What Information Was Impacted?

While AMC does not have any evidence of misuse of PII, AMC is nonetheless notifying individuals of the Incident out of an abundance of caution and for purposes of full transparency. Based on the investigation, the unauthorized party may have had access to one or more of the following data elements: name, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, financial account information, and/or limited health information. Please note that not every data element was present for every individual.

What Steps Have We Taken to Protect Your Information?

Following the Incident, AMC has continued to strengthen its security posture by adding the following security controls: strengthening password complexity requirements; updating intrusion detection and intrusion prevention policies; and updating security awareness and training for our employees.

Additionally, we have also obtained complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection for all potentially affected individuals. We encourage you to take advantage of the complimentary credit monitoring services and identity theft protection.

What Steps Can You Take to Protect Your Information?

If you believe that AMC may have had your PII in connection with any cases handled by AMC in which you were a party, please call 1-800-405-6108 to obtain a code to register for complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. Please note that you may be required to provide the case information.

AMC encourages individuals to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review account statements, and explanation of benefits forms, and to monitor free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors.

Additional steps you can take to protect yourself are outlined below.

Credit Reports: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. To order your free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com, or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. You can also order your annual free credit report by mailing a completed Annual Credit Report Request Form (available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA, 30348-5281.

Fraud Alerts: You can place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus by phone and online with Equifax (https://assets.equifax.com/assets/personal/Fraud_Alert_Request_Form.pdf); TransUnion (https://www.transunion.com/fraud-alerts); or Experian (https://www.experian.com/fraud/center.html). A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. As of September 21, 2018, initial fraud alerts last for one year. Victims of identity theft can also get an extended fraud alert for seven years. The phone numbers for all three credit bureaus are at the bottom of this page.

Monitoring: You should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.

Security Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency. You may make that request by certified mail, overnight mail, regular stamped mail, or by following the instructions found at the websites listed below.

The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse or a minor under the age of 16, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. As of September 21, 2018, it is free to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. You may also place a security freeze for children under the age of 16. You may obtain a free security freeze by contacting any one or more of the following national consumer reporting agencies:

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

Hoya Optical Labs of America, Inc. provides prescription lenses to eyecare providers, including [yours/name of ECP where instructed]. On behalf of [your eyecare provider/name of ECP where instructed] we are contacting you about a recent ransomware attack that is further described below. This incident compromised the security of your name and prescription information. Although we do not believe this information could be misused to commit identity theft or fraud, we are notifying you of this incident and providing you with guidance and services to help you protect yourself against these risks.

What Happened

On April 5, 2021, we discovered that files on some of our servers and workstations in the U.S. had been encrypted in an apparent ransomware attack. Our team worked diligently to minimize the impact on our servers and operations, and to restore functionality. We reported the incident to law enforcement. We engaged an outside law firm and forensics experts to investigate the scope and impact of the incident, including investigating whether any data was taken by the attackers, and to identify any such data and the affected individuals. Our investigation into this incident included a programmatic and manual review of the data.

What Information Was Involved

Our investigation recently concluded that the attackers acquired your name and your eyecare provider. In some cases, the data may have also included your eyewear prescription information. In providing services to your employer, we do not collect other personal information such as your Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers, financial account information, or addresses, and therefore none of this information was compromised in this incident.

What We Are Doing

Although we do not believe that your name, identity of your eyecare provider and/or your eyewear prescription information could be misused for identity theft or fraud, Hoya has notified your eyecare provider, and is notifying you of this incident on behalf of your eyecare provider. We are also reviewing and enhancing our system security, governance practices and ongoing monitoring to help prevent a recurrence of an incident like this in the future.

What You Can Do

We recommend that you remain vigilant and review your account statements and credit reports regularly, and report any concerning transactions to your financial services provider. We also provide the enclosed guidance, which you may use to protect yourself, even though we do not believe this incident exposes you to a risk of identity theft or fraud.

For More Information

Please call [insert VENDOR toll-free number] or go to [VENDOR WEBSITE] for assistance or for any additional questions you may have.

Sincerely,

Eduardo Martins
President, North America at Hoya Vision Care

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228.

Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney Generals office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That’s because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can’t see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Re: Notification of Breach Involving Personal Medical Information

At Broward Health, protecting the personal and medical information of our patients is one of our top priorities. In this regard, I am writing to inform you of a recent isolated incident involving your personal medical information. Although we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we are writing to make you aware of the security incident so that you may take any necessary precautions and to offer identity monitoring services at no cost to you to further protect your information.

What Happened?

On October 15, 2021, an intruder who gained unauthorized access to the Broward Health network may have accessed some of your personal information. Broward Health discovered the intrusion on October 19, 2021. Broward Health promptly contained the incident upon discovery, notified the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), required all employees to update their passwords and engaged an independent cybersecurity firm to conduct an extensive investigation into the incident. The investigation determined the intrusion occurred through the office of a third-party medical provider who is permitted access to the system to provide healthcare services. Broward Health also engaged an experienced data review specialist to conduct an extensive review of the data, which determined that your personal medical information was included in data accessed by the intruder. We are alerting you to this situation now that the involvement of your personal medical information has been confirmed. The DOJ requested that Broward Health briefly delay this notification to ensure that the notification does not compromise the ongoing law enforcement investigation.

What Information Was Involved?

The personal medical information that was accessed may have included your name, date of birth, address, phone number, financial or bank account information, Social Security number, insurance information and account number, medical information including history, condition, treatment and diagnosis, medical record number, driver's license number, and email address. This personal information was exfiltrated, or removed, from Broward Health's systems, however, there is no evidence the information was actually misused by the intruder.

What We Are Doing

Broward Health takes the protection of your personal and medical information very seriously. We regularly review our systems as well as our privacy and security practices to enhance those protections. In response to this incident, Broward Health is taking steps to prevent recurrence of similar incidents, which include the ongoing investigation, a password reset with enhanced security measures across the enterprise, and the implementation of multifactor authentication for all users of its systems. We have also begun implementation of additional minimum-security requirements for devices that are not managed by Broward Health Information Technology that access our network, which will become effective in January 2022.

To help protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary two-year membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM. This product provides you with superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft. The attachment to this letter provides detailed instructions on how you can activate your membership to begin monitoring your personal information.

What You Can Do

Although we have no evidence that your information has been misused, we want to make you aware of resources you may access to help safeguard your personal information. Even though we have no indication that your personal information has been used to commit fraud, we recommend that you consider steps to protect yourself from medical identity theft. Medical identity theft occurs when someone uses an individual's name, and sometimes other identifying information, without the individual's knowledge to obtain medical services or products, or to fraudulently bill for medical services that have not been provided. We suggest that you regularly review the explanation of benefits statements that you receive from your health plan. If you see any service that you did not receive, contact the health plan at the number on the statement.

We also recommend that you monitor your financial accounts and if you see any unauthorized activity, promptly contact your financial institution.

Notice of Data Breach

Ravkoo is a digital SaaS platform for prescription fulfillment providing prescription delivery to patients doorsteps. We recently discovered that a data security incident on Ravkoo's AWS portal may have resulted in the unintentional exposure of your personal information. This letter contains additional information about the incident, our response to this incident, and steps you can take to protect yourself. Please be assured that Ravkoo takes the protection and proper use of personal information very seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

What Happened

Ravkoo utilizes AWS cloud services for online hosting of its prescription portal. On September 27, 2021, Ravkoo detected that this portal was the target of a cybersecurity attack. An unauthorized third party attempted to infiltrate the portal. On October 27, 2021, Ravkoo's responsive forensic investigation revealed that certain prescription and health information could have been compromised. Notably, we have found no evidence that your Social Security Number was accessed or compromised as Ravkoo does not maintain this information within the impacted portal.

Although we have found no evidence that your information has been specifically accessed for misuse, it is possible that your full name, mail address, phone number, and prescription/limited medical information could have been exposed.

At this time, Ravkoo does not have any evidence to indicate that any of your personal information has been or will be misused as a result of this incident. Nevertheless, Ravkoo decided to notify you of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

What We Are Doing

In light of this incident, Ravkoo is actively assessing ways we can further improve our cybersecurity posture.

A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. As of September 21, 2018, initial fraud alerts last for one year.

The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. As of September 21, 2018, it is free to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. You may also place a security freeze for children under the age of 16. You may obtain a free security freeze by contacting any one or more of the following national consumer reporting agencies:

What Happened:

On or about November 10, 2021, Ebara Technologies Inc. (ETI) experienced a network security incident, which resulted in the potential compromise of a portion of ETIs IT environment. The incident was first discovered on November 10, 2021, when employees of ETI were locked out of the ETI IT network environment. In response, among other things, ETI immediately retained an IT firm to conduct a thorough forensic investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident. While our investigation is still ongoing, there is no forensic evidence to confirm that your PII was compromised. Because we are committed to protecting your personal data, we are proactively providing you this notice, in an abundance of caution, so that you may diligently monitor your accounts.

What Information Was Involved:

The third-party forensic and cyber security IT firm we retained also assisted in the remediation of our system, including eliminating the vulnerability that was used by the unauthorized actor and implementing additional security measures. As such, we have already strengthened our system, and will continue to do so throughout this response process and beyond.

On August 6, 2021, we observed some suspicious activity involving some employee email accounts.

Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we conducted a review of the contents of the email accounts to identify any individuals whose personal information may have been contained within the emails and attachments. After a thorough review, it was determined on December 8, 2021, that some of your information was contained in the accounts.

What Information Was Involved?

An email or attachment in the accounts included your <<insert variable text>>.

Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

Nature

On November 9, 2021, MRIoA discovered that it was the victim of a sophisticated cyber incident that resulted in unauthorized access to its network. At that time, MRIoA took immediate steps to stop the threat and understand the full scope of the situation. This included hiring third-party forensic experts to conduct a thorough investigation, technological remediation efforts, and contacting the FBI to seek assistance with the incident. The forensic investigation recently concluded and found that the unauthorized individual gained access to its systems via a SonicWall vulnerability on November 2, 2021, that has been removed, and MRIoAs environment has been secured.

On November 16, 2021, to the best of its ability and knowledge, MRIoA retrieved and subsequently confirmed the deletion of the obtained information. Subsequently, MRIoA began a comprehensive search of the data to determine what information was involved and the individuals the incident impacted. MRIoA recently concluded its review and determined that the incident involved personal information related to 1,846 Iowa residents.

January 14, 2022

What Happened?

On or about November 16, 2021, one of our employees received an email that appeared to be from a voicemail service. That email was from a criminal, however, and when the employee clicked on the link, he was redirected to a website that purported to store his voicemail. The employee entered their email and password, which the criminals used to access some information, generally related to our internal financial processes. We discovered the intrusion on November 16, 2021. We immediately began an investigation and containment measures, including password resets. During the course of our investigation, we determined that limited client information was in some emails accessed by the criminals. While we have no evidence that the criminals have misused this information, or even were seeking the names of our clients, we have decided to notify you so that you can take the steps to protect yourself, if you so desire.

What Information Was Involved?

The vast majority of records were limited to first name and last name. While in most cases this is not sufficient information to trigger notification, given the sensitive nature of our work, we decided to notify you out of an abundance of caution. Some records did include COVID vaccination status. No payment card information, social security numbers, or treatment records were implicated.

What We Are Doing.

When we discovered the intrusion, we took immediate steps to halt the criminals' access. We have no evidence of continued access at this time. In addition, we have retained outside experts to help us understand the full scope of any criminal activity and to validate our containment measures. We have enhanced our security to help prevent this type of incident in the future, although no security is perfect. We are currently developing plans to enhance our security further.

What You Can Do.

At this time, we have no evidence that any client information implicated by this incident has been used for fraudulent purposes. However, it is always a good idea to review statements that you receive from financial institutions to ensure the accuracy of all charges. In addition, clients may contact their treatment centers to sign up for credit monitoring services or additional information.

For Additional Information.

Please contact us at 1 (619) 398-4594.

Annual Credit Report Request Service
P.O. Box 105281
Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

Security Freeze.

Security freezes, also known as credit freezes, restrict access to your credit file, making it harder for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. You can freeze and unfreeze your credit file for free. You also can get a free freeze for your children who are under 16. And if you are someone's guardian, conservator, or have a valid power of attorney, you can get a free freeze for that person, too.

How will these freezes work? Contact all three of the nationwide credit reporting agencies Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. If you request a freeze online or by phone, the agency must place the freeze within one business day. If you request a lift of the freeze, the agency must lift it within one hour. If you make your request by mail, the agency must place or lift the freeze within three business days after it gets your request. You also can lift the freeze temporarily without a fee.

Don't confuse freezes with locks. They work in a similar way, but locks may have monthly fees. If you want a free freeze guaranteed by federal law, then opt for a freeze, not a lock. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well):

(1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes;
(2) Social Security number;
(3) date of birth;
(4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and
(5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles.

The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue.

You may further educate yourself regarding identity theft, fraud alerts, credit freezes, and the steps you can take to protect your personal information by contacting the consumer reporting bureaus, the Federal Trade Commission, or your state Attorney General. The Federal Trade Commission may be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580; www.identitytheft.gov; 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); and TTY: 1-866-653-4261. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. You can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. Please note that in order to file a report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some proof that you have been a victim. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should also be reported to law enforcement and your state Attorney General.	An employee was phished through an email and clicked on a link that redirected them to a fake voicemail service, which then allowed the criminals to access some financial information. Limited client information was also accessed, including first and last names, and COVID vaccination status.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

We are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident involving an online life insurance quoting platform of American Family Life Insurance Company (AFLIC). You may have been affected by an unauthorized attempt to obtain your personal data through this quoting platform. This letter will provide you with information about the incident and a no-cost service that AFLIC is making available to you to help monitor potential misuse of your personal data.

What Happened

If you suspect that your data has been used to fraudulently apply for unemployment benefits, you should contact the relevant state unemployment agency immediately.

What We Are Doing

We identified the unauthorized activity and immediately took action to address it. We blocked the activity and worked to notify potentially affected consumers. If you did not previously have a relationship with AFLIC, we will delete your information once our investigation is complete and we have met our legal and regulatory obligations. We take our responsibility to safeguard personal information seriously and we have enhanced our security controls to help prevent this type of incident from reoccurring.

Notice of Data Incident

Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>>:

We are contacting you to inform you of a data incident experienced by a third-party vendor for Caring Communities Shared Services, Ltd. (Caring Communities). As this relates to you, Caring Communities is a member-owned liability insurance company that exclusively serves not-for-profit senior housing and care organizations. The third-party vendor is Netgain Technology, Inc. (Netgain), which offers hosting and cloud IT solutions to various industries. This letter contains additional information about the incident, our response to the incident, and steps you can take to protect yourself. Please be assured that Caring Communities takes the protection and proper use of personal information very seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

What Happened

Netgain was recently the target of a cybersecurity incident. Upon discovery, we worked with our information technology (IT) support team and engaged a law firm specializing in cybersecurity and data privacy to investigate further. We have also stayed in close communication with Netgain and its breach counsel regarding Netgain's incident response and forensic investigation.

Based on the results of this investigation, we have determined that information, including your name, address, social security number, and limited medical history, were potentially accessed by an unknown party that is not authorized to handle or view such information. At this time, Caring Communities does not have any evidence to indicate that any of your personal information has been or will be misused as a result of this incident. Nevertheless, Caring Communities decided to notify you of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

What We Are Doing

In light of this incident, Caring Communities replaced Netgain as its hosting vendor and migrated our environment and data to another service provider that has assured us the data will be hosted in such a way that it cannot be exposed in a similar attack. Additionally, we are working to improve security and mitigate risk by reviewing and altering our policies and procedures relating to the security of our systems and servers, as well as our information life cycle management.

As a safeguard, we have arranged for you to enroll in a complementary, online credit monitoring service for <<12/24>> months provided by ID Experts Corp. (IDX).

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

At the Medical Review Institute of America (MRIoA), we value transparency and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know about a data security incident that involves your protected personal information, what we did in response, and steps you can take to protect yourself against possible misuse of the information. Please note that you are receiving this letter because <<b2b_text_1 (Covered Entity)>> provided us information to facilitate a clinical peer review of a health care service you requested or received.

What Happened

On November 9, 2021, we learned that we were the victim of a sophisticated cyber-attack. Once we found out, we quickly took steps to secure and safely restore our systems and operations. Further, we immediately engaged third-party forensic and incident response experts to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident's nature and scope and assist in the remediation efforts. We also contacted the FBI to inform them of the incident and seek guidance. On November 12, 2021, we discovered that the incident involved the unauthorized acquisition of information. On November 16, 2021, to the best of our ability and knowledge, we retrieved and subsequently confirmed the deletion of the obtained information. Our investigation into the cause of the incident is ongoing. However, once we retrieved the information, we began determining the individuals impacted in the incident. Further, based on a comprehensive review, we discovered that your protected health information was included in the incident. However, as of now, we have no evidence indicating misuse of any of your information.

What Information Was Involved

The types of protected health information potentially involved (only if this information was provided to MRIoA by the organization named above) are your demographic information (i.e., first and last name, gender, home address, phone number, email address, date of birth, and social security number); clinical information (i.e., medical history/diagnosis/treatment, dates of service, lab test results, prescription information, provider name, medical account number, or anything similar in your medical file and/or record); and financial information (i.e., health insurance policy and group plan number, group plan provider, claim information).

Monitor Your Accounts
Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you may need to provide some or all of the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

We are writing to inform you of an incident involving unauthorized access to some LendUS employee email accounts. We immediately secured the email accounts and began an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person accessed certain accounts between February 2, 2021, and March 22, 2021. Although we were unable to determine if any emails or attachments were accessed or downloaded, we reviewed the emails and attachments that could have been accessed or downloaded.

We discovered that an email or attachment contained your <<Data Elements>> on December 21, 2021. We take this incident seriously and have implemented additional safeguards and technical security measures to enhance the security of our computer systems. We are also providing additional security awareness training for our staff.

We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity. If you notice any unauthorized charges or activity, please contact the relevant financial institution or credit bureau immediately. As an added precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership with Equifax Complete Premier, including credit monitoring and fraud alerts.

If you have any questions, please call 855-604-1753, Monday through Friday from 6:00 A.M. through 6:00 P.M. Pacific Time.

Sincerely,
LendUS, LLC

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE:

We recommend that you review your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity over the next twelve to twenty-four months. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report.

If your health insurance or medical information was involved, it is advisable to review the billing statements you receive from your health insurer or healthcare provider. If you see charges for services you did not receive, please contact the insurer or provider immediately.

If your username and password to an online account was involved, it is advisable to change your password to the account as well as any other accounts that use the same or a similar password.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. To place a freeze on your credit reports, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	The breach involving unauthorized access to employee email accounts suggests that this was a hacking incident.

Monitor Your Accounts
Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.

Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;

PulseTV is writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that involved some of the information we use to process orders, including information potentially related to you. We take this matter very seriously and are providing this notice to you as a precautionary measure to explain steps that you can take to protect your information.

On March 8, 2021, VISA informed us that our website (www.pulsetv.com) was a common point of purchase for some unauthorized credit card transactions and that the website may have a possible compromise. We conducted malware scans, checked our security settings, and cooperated with VISA's requests for information. We did not find any ongoing compromise involving customer credit cards, nor were we aware of any customer complaints regarding credit card use on our website prior to hearing from VISA.

The next time we heard from VISA was in July 2021. We provided additional information at that time and did not have any follow-up from VISA or any other card brand. A few months later, law enforcement contacted us regarding additional payment card compromises that appeared to have originated from our website. We then started working with legal counsel with expertise in cybersecurity. Legal counsel also hired nationally-recognized cybersecurity experts to assist with the investigation.

On November 18, 2021, our investigator learned that the website had been identified as a common point of purchase for a number of unauthorized credit card transactions for MasterCard. Based upon communications with the card brands, it is believed that only customers who purchased products on the website with a credit card between November 1, 2019, and August 31, 2021, may have been affected. The investigation was unable to verify that the website was the cause of the unauthorized transactions. However, in an abundance of caution, PulseTV is notifying customers, including you, who purchased products on our website during that time period so that they can take steps to protect and secure their credit card information.

The affected information may have included your name, address, email address, payment card number, expiration date, and card security code (CVV) provided during checkout.

We are continuously working to identify and mitigate threats and evaluate our IT security protocols to make sure that sensitive data is protected. In addition, to further improve our website security and help prevent similar occurrences in the future, we have taken, or will be taking, the following steps:

1. Adding two-factor authentication requirements for all internal devices;
2. Utilizing end-point detection and response tools to provide greater network visibility and threat mitigation; and
3. Migrating to a different payment system.

We are also working with the payment card networks to keep them informed and cooperating with the ongoing investigation of the incident by law enforcement. Finally, we are providing notice of this incident to appropriate state regulators, consistent with our compliance obligations and responsibilities.

We recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. If you believe your payment card information may have been compromised, we strongly encourage you to contact your payment card company and/or financial institution and request that the card be canceled.

If you have any further questions, please contact us at 1-855-618-3212, Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Eastern Time (excluding some U.S. holidays).

Sincerely,

Based on the information provided, it appears that unauthorized credit card transactions had taken place on the website of Penn LLC doing business as Pulse TV. VISA informed the company that their website may have been compromised and that it was a common point of purchase for some unauthorized credit card transactions. The affected information includes payment card number, expiration date, and card security code (CVV) provided during checkout. Customers who purchased products on the website with a credit card between November 1, 2019, and August 31, 2021, may have been affected. PulseTV has taken steps to prevent similar occurrences in the future, such as migrating to a different payment system and adding two-factor authentication for all internal devices.

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a credit freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)
Social Security number
Date of birth
Addresses for the prior two to five years
Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill

We then worked with third-party specialists to perform a comprehensive review of the affected files to determine what information was impacted and to whom the information related. Upon completion of the review, we then conducted a time-intensive manual review of our records to determine the identities and contact information for potentially affected individuals. On or around December 22, 2021, we confirmed address information for affected individuals to provide notifications.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Midland University (Midland) located at 900 North Clarkson Street, Fremont, NE 68025, and are writing to notify your office of an event that may affect the security of certain personal information relating to approximately six hundred forty-five (645) Iowa residents. This notice may be supplemented if new significant facts are learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Midland does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On January 18, 2021, Midland discovered that its network had been impacted by a sophisticated malware attack that encrypted certain computer files. Midland immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of third-party computer forensic specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the event and notified federal law enforcement. Midland also worked quickly to: (1) secure its systems; (2) restore access to the information so Midland could continue to operate without disruption, and (3) investigate what happened and whether the event resulted in any unauthorized access to, or theft of, information by the unknown actor. Through the investigation, Midland determined that the unknown actor gained access to certain files on January 18, 2021 and downloaded a subset of those files.

Midland then worked with third-party data review specialists to perform a comprehensive programmatic and manual review of the affected files to determine what information was impacted and to whom the information related. Upon completion of the third-party review, Midland then conducted a time-intensive manual review of its records to determine the identities and contact information for potentially affected individuals. On or around December 22, 2021, Midland concluded its review. The information that could have been subject to unauthorized access for Iowa residents includes name, address, Social Security number, drivers license or state identification number, and financial account information.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On or about January 25, 2022, Midland provided written notice of this event to affected individuals, which includes approximately six hundred forty-five (645) Iowa residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, Midland moved quickly to investigate and respond, assess the security of its systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. Midland has also implemented additional technical and administrative safeguards and training to its employees. Midland has also engaged third-party cybersecurity specialists to provide ongoing information technology and security services. To date, Midland has not received any indication of identity theft or fraud as a result of this event.

What Happened?

On or about October 3, 2021, we experienced a network disruption that impacted our ability to access certain District files and systems. We immediately began an investigation, which included working with third-party specialists to determine the full nature and scope of the activity. Our investigation is ongoing; however, it was able to determine that certain segments of our network were accessed during the incident. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we conducted a review of the contents of the potentially impacted network locations to determine the type of information contained therein and to whom the information related. On October 13, 2021, we determined that files containing certain current and former employee information were present in the potentially impacted network locations. To date, the investigation has not revealed any evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information as a result of this incident. On January 10, 2022, we discovered additional contact information for a limited group of people. We are therefore sending follow-up communications to that limited group to ensure all potentially impacted individuals are made aware of this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation revealed that the information potentially impacted included your first and last name as well as your Social Security number, and may have also included your medical information.

What We Are Doing.

In response to this incident, we changed account passwords and enhanced security protocols. We are working with third-party specialists to harden our network and are reviewing our policies and procedures related to data protection. Our investigation into this incident remains ongoing.

What You Can Do.

As previously stated, to date, we have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information as a result of this incident. However, in an abundance of caution, we are providing you access to <<12/24>> months of credit monitoring and identity protection services through Equifax at no cost to you. If you received a previous letter and have already enrolled in the credit monitoring, there is nothing additional you need to do. However, if you did not receive a previous letter or have not yet enrolled, instructions about how to enroll in these services and additional resources available to you are included in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information.

This letter explains the incident and offers you assistance for safeguarding your information, including complimentary identity monitoring services.

What Happened

On August 8, 2021, an unauthorized party accessed the ReproSource network. We discovered ransomware on the morning of August 10, and in less than an hour we severed all network connection activity and contained the incident. We immediately launched a comprehensive investigation to determine the cause and scope of the incident. We retained leading cybersecurity experts to assist with our investigation, confirmed containment of the ransomware, and quickly and securely recovered operations. Additionally, we promptly notified law enforcement.

While our investigation did not confirm that the unauthorized party acquired data in the incident, out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying individuals whose personal information may have been accessed. We undertook an extensive analysis of our files to determine which individuals and data may have been affected and, on September 24, 2021, we identified individuals potentially affected. Although our data analysis is ongoing, in the interest of initiating notifications, we are sending you this notice and providing the services outlined in this letter.

As previously noted, since our data analysis is ongoing, we will follow up with you as appropriate if we identify other types of personal information that may have been accessed.

What We Are Doing

As discussed above, upon learning of the attack, we immediately severed all network connection activity and contained the incident. We also enhanced our cybersecurity by adding additional monitoring and detection tools as safeguards against ransomware and other cyber threats.

On June 14, 2021, Luttrell Staffing became aware that certain files on its computer system were encrypted with malware by an unknown actor. Luttrell Staffing promptly took steps to secure the impacted systems and its network and launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the event. The investigation determined that an unauthorized actor gained access to certain Luttrell Staffing systems between June 10, 2021, and June 23, 2021. As a result, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain files within these systems and certain current and former employee and associate information may have been accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor.

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com

Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place.

February 1, 2022

Dear First Name Last Name,

Pellissippi State Community College (PSCC) is informing individuals of a recent data security incident that may have resulted in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, some personal information of our former and current students, faculty, and staff and participants in Tennessee Consortium for International Studies (TNCIS) programs.

What Happened?

PSCC was the victim of a ransomware cyberattack overnight on December 5-6, 2021. We have confirmed unauthorized access to one system, but it is possible that others may have been accessed. While PSCC was also a victim, we apologize for any stress and concern this has caused.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation confirmed that the attacker had access to our Active Directory database, which includes first and last name; PSCC username; PSCC email address; office location and phone number; job title and department (if an employee); P number (a unique number assigned to each student and employee used only at PSCC and not used to sign documents); General user ID number (a long random string of numbers used only by PSCC in its Banner system); and PSCC account password (hashed). This was the only database to which access was confirmed. It is possible, however, that other personal data in our system could have been accessed.

What We Are Doing

Since the incident, we have notified local law enforcement, including the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and appropriate state and federal authorities, scanned every computer, and enhanced security measures.

What You Can Do

While we do not know if your data was viewed, we generally recommend you remain vigilant, monitor and review your financial and account statements, and report any unusual activity. More specifically, we recommend you:

- Reset passwords for any accounts that used the same password as was in our system (and use different passwords for different accounts);
- Notify your financial institution if you detect suspicious activity on your accounts;
- Report incidents of fraudulent activity or suspected identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, the Federal Trade Commission, and/or your state attorney general;
- Monitor your free credit reports;
- Consider placing a freeze on your credit files and/or a fraud alert on your credit report;
- File a police report if you experience identity fraud;
- Take advantage of the Federal Trade Commission's information at: IdentityTheft.gov and Identity Theft | FTC Consumer Information; and
- Review the attached State-Specific and Other Important Information.

What You Can Do.

Under U.S. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, (877) 322-8228. You may also directly contact the three major credit-reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

Consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

As an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. The credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. Addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and
7. A copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

This letter explains the incident, outlines the measures we have taken, and provides steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

On October 14, 2021, JSF launched an investigation into suspicious activity originating from an employee's email account. As soon as we became aware of the activity, we took immediate steps to secure the email account, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist in a forensic analysis of the incident. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized individual accessed a JSF employee's email account.

Therefore, we conducted a thorough review of the entire contents of the account to determine the specific individuals whose information was contained within the emails and attachments. On a positive note, it has been determined that this incident did not affect SAI or Advisor Group Inc. computer systems, and there is no impact to these associated systems or data. Furthermore, your advisor has experienced no disruptions in servicing your account.

If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a security freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by sending a request in writing or by mail, to all three nationwide credit reporting companies. To find out more about how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information:

Equifax Security Freeze
P.O. Box 105788
Atlanta, GA 30348
https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/
(800) 349-9960

Experian Security Freeze
P.O. Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013
http://experian.com/freeze
(888) 397-3742

TransUnion Security Freeze
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19016
http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze
(888) 909-8872

In order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit monitoring company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

3. Obtaining a Free Credit Report.
Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

4. Additional Helpful Resources.
Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many creditors will want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint with the FTC by contacting them on the web at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338), or by mail at Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. In addition, you may obtain information from the FTC about fraud alerts and security freezes.

If this notice letter states that your financial account information and/or credit or debit card information was impacted, we recommend that you contact your financial institution to inquire about steps to take to protect your account, including whether you should close your account or obtain a new account number.

If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the city in which you currently reside.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

At Faneuil, we value the trust that individuals place in us with their information, and we understand the importance of protecting information that we maintain. For these reasons, we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that involved your personal information. This notice explains the incident, measures that we have taken in response, and steps that you may consider taking as well.

WHAT HAPPENED?

We learned on August 18, 2021, that we were the target of a ransomware attack. In response, we immediately isolated all impacted systems to disrupt the attack and prevent further access by the attackers, and, working with independent cybersecurity experts, we launched a forensic investigation into the causes and impacts of the incident, as we also sought to rebuild systems and recover from the attack. In the course of our investigation, we learned that, prior to launching the attack, the attackers accessed and copied certain company records, including records of past and present Faneuil employees. Because we value protecting individuals' information, we engaged with the ransomware group and ultimately paid them, and we received confirmation from the attackers that they destroyed all copied information. In addition, during our investigation and response to the incident, we engaged a digital risk protection firm to perform internet and dark web monitoring for indications of Faneuil data. At this time, we have no reason to believe that any of the data went beyond the attackers, or was misused or made publicly available.

To help protect your information, we are offering a 24-month membership in Experian IdentityWorks. Directions for how to enroll in this service are provided below.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

The employment records accessed by the ransomware attackers included names, addresses at the time of employment, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, and email addresses.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

When we learned of this incident, we immediately isolated all systems to disrupt the attack and prevent further access by the attackers, and we engaged independent cybersecurity experts to investigate the causes and impacts of the incident. We also engaged an independent data risk protection firm to facilitate communications with the attackers. To protect individuals' personal information, we ultimately paid the attackers and received confirmation that they destroyed all copied information. In addition, we reported the incident to and cooperated with law enforcement. As part of our response to the incident, we implemented additional information security measures and rebuilt systems, to prevent any persistence of these attackers, to prevent similar future incidents, and to enhance the protection of information that we hold. We are confident that our efforts to contain the attack and additional security measures will prevent similar attacks in the future.

indicated on the pertinent DRP(s) that the Case Number(s) contained personal infonnation, until
recently the Registration Systems' software did not suppress case numbers that may have
included this indication. The IPU requested for the Reports to exclude social security numbers
and other personal infonnation, and the Reports did exclude or mask social security numbers and
other personal infonnation entered in fields specifically soliciting that infonnation. The IPU was
unaware that personal infonnation remained embedded in the case/docket field.

What Happened? On October 12, 2016, we discovered that Luther College had become the target of a phishing
email campaign and that a few Luther College employees bad clicked on the phishing emails and entered their
credentials. We immediately took steps to secure these employees' computers and email accounts and launched
an in-depth investigation to determine whether any sensitive information was accessed or acquired. On
November I, 2016, we determined, with the help of outside computer forensic investigators, that an unknown
individual or individuals bad gained access to the workstation computer files and email accounts of Luther
College employees. These workstation computer files and email accounts contained, among other things,
personally identifiable information of certain individuals related to Luther College. While we have no evidence

As we have reported over the past several months, unfortunately, some Wendy's restaurants have been
the victim of malicious cyber activity targeting customers' payment card information. We sincerely
apologize to anyone who has been inconvenienced as a result of these highly sophisticated, criminal
cyberattacks. We have conducted a rigorous investigation to understand what has happened and we are
committed to protecting our customers and keeping you informed.
Wendy's first reported unusual payment card activity affecting some restaurants in February 2016. In
May, we confirmed that we had found evidence of malware being installed on some restaurants' pointof-
sale systems, and had worked with our investigator to disable it. On June 91h, we reported that we had
discovered additional malicious cyber activity involving other restaurants. That malware has also been
disabled in all franchisee restaurants where it has been discovered. We believe that both criminal
cyberattacks resulted from service providers' remote access credentials being compromised, allowing
access - and the ability to deploy malware - to some franchisees' point-of-sale systems. & We believe that both criminal

Wendy's recently reported additional malicious cyber activity involving some franchisee-operated
restaurants. The Company believes this criminal cyberattack resulted from a service provider's remote
access credentials being compromised, allowing access - and the ability to deploy malware - to some
franchisees' POS systems. Soon after detecting the malware, Wendy's identified a method of disabling
it and thereafter has disabled the malware in all franchisee restaurants where it has been discovered. The
investigation has confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on
some Wendy's franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015. & Based on the facts known to Wendy's at this time, the additional malware targeted the following
payment card data: cardholder name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, cardholder
verification value, and service code. Please note that the cardholder verification value that may have
been put at risk is not the three or four digit value that is printed on the back or front of cards, which is
sometimes used in online transactions.	The breach was a result of a service provider's remote access credentials being compromised, allowing access to franchisee-operated restaurants' POS systems and ability to deploy malware. Wendy's identified and disabled the malware in all franchisee restaurants where it was discovered. Investigation confirmed malware was deployed on some Wendy's franchisee systems in late fall 2015. Payment card data including cardholder name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, cardholder verification value, and service code was targeted.
On behalf of my client, Schwan's Horne Service, Inc. ("Schwan' s" ), please allow this
correspondence to serve as written notification that CARDSource, a third-party vendor which
produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the Schwan 'sPayÂ® accounts of my
client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation that the records of 323 IA Schwan 's customers, as of August I, 2016 may
have been exposed to a hacker of fore ign origin as far back as October 9, 2015. While there is no
record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the CARDSource
systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively
considered by Schwan's to be compromised.
These records were held by CARDSource in a contracted data center, and contained the following
information for those 323 c ustomers: name, address, phone number, ema il address and
Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number. The Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number ties directly to each customer's
Schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on
file with Schwan's. All 323 affected Schwan'sPayÂ® cards on file with CARDSource have been
disabled by Schwan's out of an abundance of caution, and upon thorough review, no fraudulent
or even questionable activity has been detected in those customers' accounts. The like lihood of
actual harm, financ ial or otherwise, is by my client's reasonable calculation to be extremely low
or non-existent due to the fact that the card can only be used for purchases with Schwan's and
alignment of a ll three accounts is necessary for a debit transaction; however, the possibility of
phishing or social engineering scams cannot be entirely ruled out. & name, address, phone number, ema il address and
Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number.	The breach involves unauthorized access to the payment card information of Schwan's Horne Service, Inc's customers that was held by a third-party vendor, CARDSource. The compromised information of the affected 323 customers included their names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses as well as Schwan'sPay® card numbers which ties directly to each customer's Schwan's account thereby enabling debiting of their bank accounts. All the affected Schwan'sPay® cards have been disabled to prevent any potential fraudulent activity.
On March 4, 2016, the investigators released their Final Incident Response Report,
which indicated that there was evidence that Schwaab's system had been accessed and
malicious code had been uploaded.
We recently learned that sometime between January 22, 2014 and January 26, 2016,
our computer system was accessed without our authorization. During this time, it is
possible that our customer credit card information may have been compromised. We have
no evidence that any specific information was accessed or stolen. Out of an abundance of
caution, we are letting you know about the incident so you can take steps to protect
yourself.
approximately 829 individuals in Iowa transacted business with Schwaab using a credit

On behalf of my client, Schwan's Horne Service, Inc. ("Schwan's"), please allow this
correspondence to serve as written notification that CARDSource, a third-party vendor which
produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the Schwan 'sPayâ€‚ accounts of my
client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation that the records of 323 IA Schwan 's customers, as of August I, 2016 may
have been exposed to a hacker of foreign origin as far back as October 9, 2015. While there is no
record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the CARDSource
systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively
considered by Schwan's to be compromised.
These records were held by CARDSource in a contracted data center, and contained the following
information for those 323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and
Schwan 'sPayâ€‚ card number. The Schwan 'sPayâ€‚ card number ties directly to each customer's
Schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on
file with Schwan's.&323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and
Schwan 'sPayâ€‚ card number. The Schwan 'sPayâ€‚ card number ties directly to each customer's

file with Schwan's.	The breach involved the exposure of Schwan's Home Service Corporation's customers' debit card information through a third-party vendor, CARDSource, which produces numbered plastic payment cards uniquely for Schwan's.
Earlier this summer, our mailing vendor mailed corrected 1099 forms for tax years 2012 and 2013 on our

your older address rather than to the current mailing address we have on file. As with all 1099 forms, that
document contained your name, address, eight-digit Scottrade account number and the last four digits of
your Social Security number.

unable to verify that you had mail forwarding in place at the time of the mailing, we are proactively
notifying you and providing you with information to help you protect your credit and identity.

What Happened
Earlier this summer, our mailing vendor mailed corrected 1099 forms for tax years 2012 and 2013 on our
behalf. Your corrected tax form(s) were included in that mailing. Your information inadvertently went to
your older address rather than to the current mailing address we have on file. As with all 1099 forms, that
document contained your name, address, eight-digit Scottrade account number and the last four digits of
your Social Security number. & contained your name, address, eight-digit Scottrade account number and the last four digits of
your Social Security number.	The breach was caused by unintended disclosure due to the mailing vendor sending corrected tax forms to the wrong address, which contained customer's personal information including name, address, account number, and SSN.
As part of a normal reconciliation process, in July 2015, Scottrade provided revised 1099 forms for the tax years 2012 and 2013 to approximately 18,000 clients. These forms were mailed by a vendor, Wall Street Concepts (WSC). WSC inadvertently mailed 1258 of these forms using addresses that Scottrade clients had provided for the 2012 and/or 2013 tax years, and which had not been updated to reflect changes of address. As a result these mailings were sent to old and outdated addresses. 428 of those have now been returned to our offices as undeliverable, leaving 812 with unknown outcomes. Those 1099 forms contained the client's name, address, eight-digit Scottrade account number and the last four digits of their Social Security Number. Scottrade became aware of the situation when contacted by clients who had become aware of mail being sent to their old addresses. Our investigation has determined that the address problem was limited to the 1240 client accounts which have been identified. The cause of the discrepancy has been located and Scottrade is taking corrective action.	The breach was an unintended disclosure, as personal information was sent to the wrong addresses due to outdated information provided by clients.

This incident first came to Gyft's attention on December 3, 2015, when it learned that a file available on the Internet appeared to contain Gyft user records. It was not immediately apparent how the file had been created, and Gyft did not discover that its cloud providers had been accessed without authorization until approximately December 28, 2015. The unknown individual(s) that accessed the cloud providers used valid Gyft credentials. As of the date of this letter, Gyft has not determined how the credentials were obtained or who obtained them. 
When Gyft became aware of this incident, it appeared that log files, including usernames and passwords, dating as far back as March 19, 2015 had been compromised. Accordingly, Gyft immediately reset user passwords for all users who had logged in during that time period. Upon identifying unauthorized logins to its cloud providers, Gyft reviewed all files stored with the cloud providers that were potentially accessed without authorization, and is notifying all Gyft users whose sensitive personal information was available in the potentially accessed files. Gyft has also forced password resets and/or logouts for additional affected users as those users were identified.& names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and gift card numbers	Access to cloud providers was gained without authorization, using valid Gyft credentials. It is unknown how the credentials were obtained, making this a case of hacking.
What Happened? The Resort began investigating unusual activity after receiving reports from its credit card processor. The Resort immediately began working with third-party forensic 
experts to investigate these reports and to identify any signs of compromise on its computer

input their payment information to purchase products from JB Autosports was the target of a cyberattack
originating from a Russian lP address. The breach affected customers who used Visa, MasterCard, Discover,
and American Express branded cards to pay for their purchases from the websites. The breach allowed
cyberanackers to intercept customer names, addresses, credit card numbers. credit card expiration dates, CID
numbers, CA V2 numbers, CVC2 numbers, and CVV2 n_umbers ("Customer Information"). The Customer
lnfomiation was intercepted after it was entered on the checkout page as it was being transmitted to PayPal for
processing. JB Autosports' policy is to not sLore customer credit card information.
Since detecting the breach, JB Autosports has made every effort to mitigate the damage by contracting with a
Lhird-party vendor to identify the source of the breach and implement security solutions Lo prevent a recurrence
of the breach. J B Autosporls has also improved its cybersecurity defenses to prevent future breaches of

("Schwan's"), please allow this correspondence to serve as written notification that CARDSource, a third-party vendor which produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the Schwan 'sPayÂ® accounts of my client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the records of 323 IA Schwan 's customers, as of August I, 2016 may have been exposed to a hacker of foreign origin as far back as October 9, 2015. While there is no record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the CARDSource systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively considered by Schwan's to be compromised. 
These records were held by CARDSource in a contracted data center, and contained the following information for those 323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number. The Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number ties directly to each customer's Schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on file with Schwan's. All 323 affected Schwan'sPayÂ® cards on file with CARDSource have been disabled by Schwan's out of an abundance of caution, and upon thorough review, no fraudulent or even questionable activity has been detected in those customers' accounts. The likelihood of actual harm, financial or otherwise, is by my client's reasonable calculation to be extremely low or non-existent due to the fact that the card can only be used for purchases with Schwan's and alignment of all three accounts is necessary for a debit transaction; however, the possibility of phishing or social engineering scams cannot be entirely ruled out.& name, address, phone number, email address and Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number	The breach involved the compromise of the Schwan’sPay® card number of 323 IA Schwan's customers, tied solely to Schwan’s accounts, which can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on file with Schwan's. All 323 affected Schwan'sPay® cards have been disabled as a precaution, but no fraudulent activity has been detected.

Choice recently learned of a technical issue that only occurred in a specific circumstance. The cause of
the issue has been addressed. The issue involved information entered by a visitor to Choiceâ€™s website
being inadvertently accessible to third parties, with whom Choice has a business relationship, when the
visitorâ€™s web browser crashed while on the site. Choice uses technology to track activities that occur on
its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to Choice.
For visitors to Choiceâ€™s website who used the Safari web browser, if Safari crashed and restarted, Safari
would put information that had been typed by the visitor on the page into the website address for that
page. Tracking technology reads the website address of pages on Choiceâ€™s website and sends the data
to third parties. Except in a Safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information
entered by visitors. We believe this occurred because of how the code for Safari was written. This
specific issue occurred approximately 88,000 times from June 2015 through November 12, 2019. & f a visitor to Choiceâ€™s website was using Safari and on the reservation page, the information that had
been typed in fields on that page that could have been put in the website address when the browser
restarted after a crash may include the name of the person making the reservation, email address, state,
zip code, country code, and the number and expiration date of the payment card used to make the
reservation. We are notifying you because this scenario occurred when you were making a reservation.
If you were making a reservation using a mixture of points and payment, the external verification value
on the card may have also been in the website address. The last four digits of the card you used were
[wxyz].	The technical issue that occurred in this specific circumstance involved inadvertent access to information entered by a visitor to Choice's website when the visitor's web browser crashed. The cause of the issue has been addressed.

What Happened? Ascension provides data analytics in connection with residential mortgage loans which are or may 
have been held by Stanwich. As part of its services, Ascension has custody of certain data related to the Stanwich 
loans and contracts with a third-party vendor, PairPrep, Inc., d/b/a OpticsML (â€œOpticsMLâ€) to process that data using 
certain technology. 
On January 15, 2019, Ascension and Stanwich were informed of a potential incident involving OpticsML. An investigation, 
supported by third-party forensic experts, was immediately commenced to determine the nature and scope of the event. 
Beginning on January 25, 2019, Ascension and Stanwich confirmed that two cloud-servers belonging to OpticsML were 
subject to unauthorized access by foreign IP addresses, and that the data hosted on those servers could have been 
acquired as early as February 2018 until January 2019.& Although the investigation is ongoing, Ascension and Stanwich determined that

We informed the Plan that on December 31, 2019, we received a technical alert concerning an email address of an IMS employee which indicated that the employeeâ€™s email user account was restricted from sending messages.At that time, we suspected that the account had been compromised due to a phishing email.We immediately took steps to secure the userâ€™s email account and, though there was no indication other accounts were affected, all other email accounts within our company.We initiated an investigation to assess the incidentâ€™s scope, including a review of all emails and attachments in the userâ€™s account during the compromised period and engaging a third-party cybersecurity firm to perform a comprehensive forensics investigation. There was no indication that your employerâ€™s systems or servers were involved. Our investigation has confirmed that emails within the affected userâ€™s email account between July 19 and December 31, 2019 were exposed to an unauthorized third party as a result of a sophisticated phishing attack. A â€œphishingâ€ email is a malicious email that appears to be legitimate to entice the user into giving up login information. An example would be an email appearing to come from your own email system claiming that â€œYour mailbox is almost out of space and requires immediate attention to avoid disconnection.â€ There would be a link in the email that appears to lead to your own email system login page, but instead takes you to an identical looking page hosted on a malicious server. By logging in, you are handing over your credentials to the malicious actor. Typically, the malicious login page would then redirect you to the legitimate login page in an effort to make you think you simply mistyped your password, avoiding suspicion.An automatic forwarding rule had been placed on the IMS employee email account which was immediately removed on discovery. & First and Last Name, Last Four Digits of Social Security Number, Transaction Date and Amount, Plan Sponsor/Employer Name, Address	The breach was caused by a sophisticated phishing attack on an employee's email account, which was then compromised and emails between July 19 and December 31, 2019 were exposed to an unauthorized third party.

While performing routine maintenance and backups on December 8, 2018, USR became aware of unusual
activity (i. e., missing data) within one server that stored an internally-facing application and database that
contained protected health information, some of which was personal information. On December 8, 2018,
the database server was taken offline for investigation. During the investigation, USR and a forensic
specialist discovered that on August 23, 2018, a USR employee made a configuration change to a firewall
rule, which inadvertently allowed the internally-facing database to be available externally from August 23,
2018 until December 8, 2018. This resulted in the database as well as the protected health information and
personal information stored in the database being accessed by unauthorized, unknown third parties. The
third parties were able to delete the data in the database.
In response to the breach , USR disabled access to the database server and engaged a national digital
forensics firm to assist with the investigation. In addition, USR is providing additional staff training and is
revisiting its security measures to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident in the future. Also, as discussed

On Friday, February 15, 2019, while trying to resolve an email failure with our email host, 
Suddenlink, I was directed to a website that gave a phone number to call for immediate assistance.
When I called this number, the technician stated he could certainly help.He requested access to 
my computer to understand the issue with the email.After I installed the software necessary to 
give him remote access to my computer, he pulled up some IP addresses on my computer screen and 
stated that this was the reason for the email failure.He then insisted that in order to fix the 
problem and prevent viruses from attacking, I would need to allow him to install a program on our 
officeâ€™s network server. I told him no and that our local computer technician would be contacted 
to deal with this. At that point, he stated that only a Microsoft Tech such as himself would be 
able to do this. This was a red flag as I thought I was dealing with a Suddenlink technician. 
At that point, I quickly disconnected my computer from the internet and from our office network.I 
then uninstalled the remote access software I had just allowed him to install, and turned the 
computer off. This entire interaction lasted less than eight minutes.

Our local computer technician was contacted immediately.They indicated that this was a known scam 
and that they try to copy information that exists on the computer they are given access to and, to 
their knowledge, are not
able to move beyond that initial local hard drive quickly, if at all.
& The information that was most at risk of being breached were those documents in the â€œMy Documentsâ€ 
folder on my computer as well as those saved on my computer.On my desktop, I kept a folder of 
items that had been emailed.If I have emailed a copy of your tax returns or other document, which 
contains your personal data, in the recent past, your data was most at risk of being compromised.
We also discovered that older years of our tax program saved on my computer were not encrypted. At 
this time, it is unknown what, if anything, was taken from
my computer in the short amount of time that the breach occured.
	The breach occurred when a technician, posing to be a Suddenlink technician, accessed the organization's computer remotely and asked to install a program on the office's network server claiming that it was necessary to fix the email failure issue and prevent viruses from attacking. The technician's request was denied, and the computer was quickly disconnected from the internet and the office network. It is unknown what data was taken, making this a likely hacking incident.

This ransomware attack locked the server that stored some of our patient information.
Immediately upon detecting the incident, we launched an investigation and engaged an independent forensics firm
to assist in determining what happened and whether any individualsâ€™ protected health information (â€œPHIâ€) had been
accessed or acquired without authorization. While there is no evidence that any sensitive or personal information
has been misused, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution. & The information potentially involved may include patient names, addresses, and
prescription information. The impacted server did not and does not store patient Social Security numbers or credit
card information.	The information describes a cyberattack that utilized ransomware to encrypt or lock a server containing patient records, which is consistent with a hacking incident.

Upon initial discovery of the incident, Capital took immediate action to secure the employee's email account and launched an investigation, with the assistance of a leading forensics firm. The investigation determined that the employee's email account had been accessed by an unauthorized party between February 8, 2018 and September 7, 2018. Further, the investigation could not rule out the possibility that the unauthorized party may have accessed some of Capital's systems, which contain client information. Capital then began the extensive process of searching the employee's inbox and the systems that may have been subject to unauthorized access to identify the contents. Capital determined that the email account and systems that may have been accessed by the unauthorized party may have contained information pertaining to current and former clients and their beneficiaries. The information involved varied per individual, but included names along with dates of birth and Social Security numbers. To date, Capital is not aware of any misuse of the information. 
Beginning on February 26, 2019, Capital will mail notification letters via United States Postal Service First-Class mail to four (4) New Hampshire residents in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. Â§ 359-C:20. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed.1 Capital is offering the New Hampshire residents complimentary one-year memberships in credit monitoring and identity theft protection services from ExperianÂ®.

Capital is also providing additional training to its employees regarding phishing emails and other cybersecurity issues. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter. 
Sincerely,

On December 9, 2019, we learned that unidentified third parties obtained the login credentials of one Overlake email
account. The third parties acquired the credentials by sending a deceptive email to Overlakeâ€™s staff members asking
them to enter the username and password of their Overlake account on a web page that was linked in the emails. This
type of cybersecurity incident is commonly known as a â€œphishingâ€ scam. The third parties then used the credentials of
the one email account to send a second series of phishing emails to Overlake staff members in another attempt to obtain
additional account usernames and passwords.
Within hours, we secured the accounts and immediately began an investigation. The investigation determined that the
third parties had access to the initially affected account from December 6â€“9, 2019, and the subsequently affected email
accounts for just a few hours on December 9, 2019. Our investigation cannot rule out that the third parties accessed
specific information stored in the email accounts, which may have included one or more of the following: your demographic
information (such as full name, date of birth, phone number, address), health insurance information (such as name of
insurer or insurance ID number), and certain health information (such as diagnosis and treatment information) related to

An attachment to the email included a list of names, addresses, social security numbers, and 2018 earnings. Our investigation included interviews with employees and inspection of all pertinent electronic records. 
After the investigation was completed, we determined that the personal information of 82 insurance agents who are residents of your state was provided via an unencrypted electronic communication 
(email) to the four individuals. We have concluded that this incident was not a systemic issue, but rather a result of human error. The employees who sent the email in error have been coached. We have also contacted the third party recipients and requested that the email be deleted. At the present time we have no evidence that this data has been used in an unauthorized manner by the recipients who received the information.	The breach was caused by an email with sensitive and personal information being sent to the wrong recipients, but not due to intentional unauthorized access or hacking.

employee email accounts. We immediately began an investigation to determine what happened and what information
may have been affected. With the assistance of third-party forensic investigators, we determined that certain employee
email accounts were subject to unauthorized access between August 28, 2018 and October 5, 2018. These email
accounts were then reviewed to determine whether they contained any protected health or personal information.
This was a resource heavy review that took several months to complete. On February 26, 2019, Episcopal Health
Services determined that the accounts subject to unauthorized access contained protected health information of
certain individuals, including you. However, the list of potentially affected individuals provided by the vendor did not
include addresses for a large number of individuals and included many potential duplicates. Therefore, Episcopal
Health Services was required to review its records to attempt to locate the missing addresses and remove potential
duplicates. This process was completed on March 19, 2019.& What Information Was Involved? The email accounts subject to unauthorized access contained the following types
of information relating to you: your <<ClientDef1(name and [data elements])>><<ClientDef2([data elements])>>. Based

I write on behalf of my client, Earl Enterprises, to inform you of a data security incident potentially affecting
payment card information of a limited number of guests that dined at certain of Earl Enterprisesâ€™
restaurants. Potentially affected restaurants include the following brands: Buca di Beppo, Earl of
Sandwich, Planet Hollywood, Chicken Guy!, Mixology and Tequila Taqueria. While we cannot confirm the
residency of the individuals potentially affected by the incident, some Washington residents may have
been affected. Earl Enterprises will be providing a notice for Washington residents potentially affected by
this incident, which will include some steps affected individuals may take to help protect themselves.
Upon learning of potential unauthorized access to certain payment cards, Earl Enterprises promptly
launched an investigation and engaged two leading cyber security firms to assist in the companyâ€™s review.
As part of the investigation, Earl Enterprises has been in contact with federal law enforcement officials and
is cooperating with them. Based on the investigation, it appears that unauthorized individuals installed
malicious software on some point-of-sale systems at a certain number of Earl Enterprisesâ€™ restaurants.
The software was designed to capture payment card data, which could have included credit and debit
card numbers, expiration dates and, in some cases, cardholder names. Although the dates of potentially
affected transactions vary by location, guests that used their payment cards at potentially affected
locations between May 23, 2018 and March 18, 2019 may have been affected by this incident. A full list
of potentially affected restaurant locations is available at www.earlenterprise.com/incident.

further remediation efforts & credit and debit card numbers, expiration dates and in some cases card holder names	Malicious software was installed on some point-of-sale systems at a certain number of Earl Enterprises' restaurants to capture payment card data, indicating an outside party was responsible for the breach through hacking.

On February 13, 2019, BambooHR became aware of unauthorized access by an unidentified thirdÂ­party to the TraxPayroll system. We determined that the unauthorized party was trying to change employee direct deposit information, which we quickly isolated and fixed. We also shut-down the means by which the unauthorized access occurred.

BambooHR then conducted a comprehensive review of all unauthorized activity and determined that a report was accessed that may have allowed the third party to view personal information of certain employees. It appears that the unauthorized party's purpose in accessing the TraxPayroll system was to divert payroll deposits into its own accounts, not to collect personal information.
The information contained in the report accessed by the unauthorized third party included the names, social security numbers, states of residence, states of employment, wage types, and applicable tax type codes of certain employees.& names, social security numbers, states of residence, states of employment, wage types, and applicable tax type codes	The unauthorized access to the TraxPayroll system by an unidentified third-party indicates that this was a hack.

On March 4, 2019, a computer server used by our warehouse became infected with ransomware. Upon discovery, we
immediately disabled network access and began an investigation to determine what occurred and what information may
have been affected. We also alerted law enforcement and we are cooperating with their investigation. Our investigation
was unable to determine if any information was removed from our server. Information related to our consultants,
employees and their dependents was stored on the affected server, which included your <<variable data>>.& Information related to
its consultants, employees and their dependents was stored on the affected server, which included
the names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and/or direct deposit and salary information of
seven New Hampshire residents.	The breach was caused by ransomware infecting the computer server used by the warehouse. Hence, an external party hacked into the server, causing the breach.
WHAT HAPPENED
We learned in late August 2018 that an unauthorized third-party may have gained access to one of our servers on
or around May 8, 2018. We conducted a comprehensive investigation of the incident, and determined that the
unauthorized third party was able to gain access to a single server used to process job application information,
including information you likely submitted when you applied for a position with Jobscience or a Jobscience
customer. Law enforcement is aware of the incident, but this notification was not delayed as a result of a law
enforcement investigation.
WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED
The affected data generally includes information submitted by or on behalf of job applicants, such as names and
contact information, and in some instances information such as Social Security Number, Driver's License Number,
Alien Registration Number, username, password or security question. The information may have been submitted
by or through your employer or a recruiter or staffing service who utilized the TalentPath service. & information submitted by or on behalf of job applicants, such as names and

On February 23, 2020, our office attempted to e-file a tax return for a client, but the filing was rejected multiple times. We contacted the IRS to investigate the error. Subsequently, our office experienced another e-filed tax return rejection. Suspecting a possible data breach, Weber and Company, Inc. had their IT consultants conduct a full scan and analysis of our systems. No positive breaches were detected. 
On March 18, 2020, we were contacted by the IRS who advised that hackers filed 2019 tax returns for some of our clients in order to obtain large refunds. After sheltering in place, we have continued the communication with the IRS criminal investigation. The IRS criminal investigators are actively investigating this issue. The FBI is now involved and conducting an investigation as well. 
Weber and Company, Inc. immediately instituted corrective measures to ensure that any access to the firm's electronic systems was terminated. Although we are unaware of any acquisition of your information or likelihood of harm to you, we are notifying you of this incident because your personal information was accessible to the perpetrator. Ifwe become aware that a false tax return was filed under your name or company, we will notify you under separate cover.& name, date of birth, telephone number(s), address, social security number, all employment (W-2) information, 1099 information, as well as direct deposit bank account information, including account number and routing information	The breach involved an outside party (hackers) who were able to access and file tax returns for the organization's clients, resulting in the theft of personal information such as name, date of birth, telephone number(s), address, social security number, all employment (W-2) information, 1099 information, as well as direct deposit bank account information, including account number and routing information.

Jobscience was informed by agents from the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation (FBI) in August 2018 that
the agents had observed certain data being exfiltrated from a Jobscience server. After the FBI provided
Jobscience a copy of the data on August 21, 2018, Jobscience confirmed that the data did, in fact, come
from a Jobscience server. Subsequent investigation determined that a legacy Jobscience TalentPath
server that housed information related to individuals who had applied for positions with Jobscience
customers was accessed by an unauthorized third party, who then exfiltrated the data housed on the
server (the "Attack"). While certain information in the server was encrypted at rest, the results of the
investigation suggest that the unauthorized party may have had sufficient access as to be able to exfiltrate
the decryption mechanism. No other elements of the Jobscience environment are believed to be involved
in the Attack.
Jobscience took prompt action upon confirming that the data came from its server. Specifically:
â€¢ Jobscience initiated an investigation to identify (i) the root cause of the Attack and (ii) the nature
and scope of the compromised data. To aid in its investigation, Jobscience retained outside

forensic auditors to conduct an independent review of the details surrounding the incident and
the data involved.
â€¢ Jobscience notified all customers that had information in the implicated server about the Attack
on August 28, 2018, via letter and telephone, and thereafter provided each customer with details
about their implicated data.
â€¢ After an initial investigation identified the potential vulnerability used in the Attack, Jobscience
took steps to resolve the vulnerability by (i) deploying a patched version of the server and
migrating all of its customers to the patched server, and (ii) updating user credentials by forcing
all administrators and users to update their passwords.
â€¢ Jobscience retained a database consultant to analyze the data exfiltrated in the Attack to identify
affected records and the customers to which those records belonged. In September 2018,
Jobscience provided to those customers detailed information regarding the affected records that
Jobscience had identified as belonging to the customer, to assist the customers with any
applicable notification obligations. 1 Further analysis of the database identified additional records
belonging to these customers that was implicated in the Attack, and Jobscience intends to
supplement our previous reports to those customers with this new information.
In addition, this further analysis of the database identified two new categories of implicated records:
(i) records that relate to Jobscience's historic use of the platform for its own hiring and applicant
management processes; and (ii) records that are not readily attributable to any particular Jobscience
customer. Jobscience is providing notice to individuals whose information falls into these two
categories, as well as to individuals whose records belong to a customer but who have not been
previously notified (unless the customer affirmatively tells Jobscience that it wants to perform the
notification). Jobscience is providing this notice to you because our records indicate that 501 individuals
that Jobscience intends to notify are residents of New Hampshire. & (i) records that relate to Jobscience's historic use of the platform for its own hiring and applicant
management processes; and (ii) records that are not readily attributable to any particular Jobscience
customer	Data was exfiltrated from a Jobscience server which housed information related to individuals who had applied for positions with Jobscience customers. The server was accessed by an unauthorized third party who exfiltrated the data. Investigation suggested that the unauthorized party may have had sufficient access to exfiltrate the decryption mechanism.

email activity. Mosaic's internal IT Department personnel immediately commenced an 
investigation of the activity, promptly secured the impacted email account to ensure that emailed 
information was no longer being compromised, and with the help of members of our Human 
Resources Department, researched the impacted email account to determine the information 
that the unauthorized person may have accessed or obtained without authorization. This 
process included an exhaustive review of user email logs, email traffic information from both 
internal and third-party email monitoring services, and a review of all emails that were contained 
in the account currently and recovered from archives of deleted emails. As a result of this 
investigation, we believe an unauthorized individual gained access to only one Mosaic email

We recently discovered that the email account of one of our employees was compromised. Although we
do not know the duration of the compromise, or with certainty what information may have been accessed,
we have reason to believe that an unauthorized individual gained access to an employeeâ€™s email account
and may have received copies of emails sent from the account from approximately 2/13/2009 through
4/18/2019. As soon as we became aware of this, we immediately secured the email account and engaged
a forensic IT firm to investigate the incident, and notified law enforcement. At this time, Aquionix and its
investigators believe that the relevant security vulnerability has been remediated. & What Information Was Involved?
The information potentially affected by this security incident varied depending on context, for example,
the content of the email and information provided by the individual, whether the individual sent or
received emails during the applicable time period, or underwent a background check or
employment/contractor onboarding during the applicable period. Information may include the content of
background check applications or reports, tax forms, health insurance, forms, or other documentation you
provided in connection with your application for employment, or in connection with the creation of your
employment or contractor relationship with Aquionix. Though additional information may have been
compromised, we have reason to believe that the following information may have been accessed or
acquired: your first and last name; email address; mailing address; phone number; social security number.
We do not have any way to determine whether the recipient of the emails actually opened or viewed the
information within any of the emails.	The breach was the result of an unauthorized individual accessing an employee's email account.
affected approximately 6 New Hampshire residents. It appears that between April 14, 2019, and
April 17, 2019, an unauthorized person or persons gained access to certain systems of the thirdparty
vendor that maintains and operates certain subscription pages for Conde Nast ("Vendor''}. The
unauthorized person(s} appear to have used this access to modify certain subscription pages to
acquire transaction information. This may have resulted In the compromise of names, postal
addresses, email addresses, and payment card information (including card number, expiration date,
and CVV} for individuals transacting on the affected subscription pages during the relevant period.
Conde Nast first learned of a potential incident on April 17, 2019, when a third-party provider of
advertising services informed Conde Nast that there was a policy violation/malvertising on a
subscription page. Conde Nast immediately began working with Vendor to assess the nature of the
potential incident. The vulnerabilities were removed on April 17, 2019. On April 24, 2019, Vendor
notified Conde Nast that it had a reasonable belief that the unauthorized code compromised
transaction information. Conde Nast does not believe that the unauthorized person(s} continue to
have access to Vendor's network or systems. Conde Nast is not aware of any evidence indicating
that the unauthorized person(s} had access to systems other than those operated by Vendor. & This may have resulted In the compromise of names, postal
addresses, email addresses, and payment card information (including card number, expiration date,
and CVV} for individuals transacting on the affected subscription pages during the relevant period.

unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, address, dob, dln, tax ID number, IRS PIN, financial account info, digital signature & On February 11, 2019, Aprio confirmed that a cyber attacker accessed an employee's Office 365 e-mail account on or about Februaiy 6, 2019, and February 11, 2019. Aprio first learned of the potential security incident on Februaiy 11 when an employee in its IT depaiiment observed an unusually large number of e-mails being sent from one specific Aprio employee's e-mail address. Through subsequent investigation, Aprio learned that this patiicular employee's mandatory multifactor authentication on his/her mobile device had been inadvetiently disabled. The disabled multifactor authentication on this employee's device enabled the cyber attacker to access this employee's Office 365 e-mail account. Consequently, the attacker was able to intrude upon Aprio's Office 365 environment.
Upon discove1y, Aprio immediately worked to successfully stop the attacker. Aprio also retained counsel and engaged multiple forensic investigators to research the origin of the security incident as well as to determine the scope of the incident. Aprio's investigation has been ongoing since it first discovered the incident in February and continues today. 
In the early phases of its investigation, Aprio sought to definitively state what e-mails and/or accounts the attacker was able to view or access while intruding on Aprio's Office 365 environment. To this end, between Februaiy 18 and 19, Aprio preserved Unified Audit Logs containing records of activity across all accounts in Aprio's Office 365 environment. Although the Unified Audit Logs are helpful for detecting unauthorized activity in a user's account during specific timeframes, they do not contain enough detail to understand what the attacker did during the timeframe or to what data the attacker had access.& Although Aprio's investigation is ongoing, the investigation thus far has revealed that the following categories of unencrypted personal information were accessed and/or acquired: 
â€¢ first and last name;
â€¢ social security number;
â€¢ street address and/or phone number;
â€¢ date of bitth;
â€¢ driver's license number;
â€¢ taxpayer identification number;
â€¢ IRS PIN number;
â€¢ financial account information (such as a checking account number, routing number, and/or PIN number);
â€¢ digital signature.	The breach was caused by a cyber attack that allowed unauthorized access to an employee's email account, resulting in the exposure of a large amount of personal information.
unauthorized access to email account; full name, birth date, Social Security number, home address, drivers license number, and the name, address, and Social Security number of employee life insurance beneficiaries & On approximately April 12, 2019, we learned that an unauthorized individual gained access to and
sent emails from one (1) employeeâ€™s email mailbox. While the unauthorized access appears to be
financially motivated, the employeeâ€™s email account did contain personally identifiable
information from emails related to employment and benefits. Although Flamboyan has no
evidence to suggest that private information was misused, it is possible. We believe that the
unauthorized individual may have accessed the employeeâ€™s email mailbox between approximately
March 18, 2019 and approximately April 12, 2019.& The personal information that could have been accessed by the unauthorized individual may have
included your:
ï‚· full name,
ï‚· birth date,
ï‚· Social Security number,
ï‚· home address,
ï‚· driverâ€™s license number, and
ï‚· the names, addresses, and social security numbers of employee life insurance beneficiaries,
each of whom will receive this notice under separate cover.	The unauthorized individual gained access to an employee's email mailbox, indicating a hack of the organization's email system.

I am writing to provide notification of an incident at Franklin Johnston that may affect the security of personal information of six (6) Maryland residents. Franklin Johnston's investigation is ongoing and this notification will be supplemented with any new or significant facts or findings subsequent to this submission, if any. By providing this notice, Franklin Johnston does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law or personal jurisdiction. Franklin Johnston recently learned that, as a result of a phishing attack, an unauthorized third-party obtained access to a few employee email accounts from November 13, 2018 through January 22, 2019. Upon learning of the issue, Franklin Johnston commenced a prompt and thorough investigation. As part of its investigation, it worked closely with external cybersecurity professionals.

On March 26, 2019, St. Vincent Medical Center ("SVMC" or "Hospital") discovered that the web email account of one of its hospital-based pathologists had been compromised. Within hours of discovering the incident on March 26, 2019, the VHS I information security team promptly terminated the unauthorized access, disabled the email account, and disconnected the device from the network. Upon further investigation, the Hospital has determined that this email account was initially compromised on March 15, 2019. During this time, a third party obtained access to the physician's email account without authorization and from this account, sent emails to various internal and external email accounts containing malicious links and attachments. It appears that this was an attempt to obtain user names and passwords from the recipients of these emails. During the window when the physician's email account was accessed by the unauthorized third party, the intruder had the ability to access any emails or attachments present in any of email folders at that time. We have confirmed that the third party did not 
gain access to the email accounts of any other Verity employee or to the VHS servers or network more generally. 
We reviewed the physician's email folders and have determined that one or more of the email attachments included some of your health information. We have not been able to conclude whether the third party actually accessed, viewed or read your health information. More importantly, your information does not appear to have been sent or forwarded and to date, we are not aware of any misuse of your information. Out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to let you know about this incident and notify you of options available to you to protect yourself.& The emails and attachments containing health information that may have been accessed without authorization included social security numbers, names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, health plan name, dates of service, treatment received, medical conditions, lab test information, phone numbers, and addresses.

Dear DQ and Orange Julius Customers, 
International Dairy Queen, Inc. recently learned of a possible malware intrusion that may have affected some payment cards at certain DQ@ locations and one Orange JuliusÂ® 
location in the U.S. Upon learning of the issue, wc launched an extensive investigation and retained external forensic experts to help determine the facts. Because nearly all DQ and Orange Julius locations are independently owned and operated, we worked closely with affected franchise owners, as well as law enforcement authorities and the payment card brands, to assess the nature and scope of the issue. As a result of our investigation, we discovered evidence that the systems of some DQ locations and one Orange Julius 
location were infected with the widely-reported Backoff malware that is targeting 
retailers across the country. The investigation revealed that a third-party vendor's 
compromised account credentials were used to access systems at those locations. 
Based on the investigation, we have established the following: 
â€¢ The Backoffmalware was present on systems at a small percentage of locations in the U.S.
â€¢ The time periods during which the Backoff malware was present on the affected systems vary by location. A list of impacted DQ locations and the one Orange
Julius location, as well as the relevant time periods, is available here.
â€¢ The affected systems contained customers' names, payment card numbers and
expiration dates. We have no evidence that other customer personal information, such as Social Security numbers, PINs or email addresses, were compromised as a result of this malware infection.
â€¢ Based on our investigation, we are confident that this malware has been
contained.
We deeply regret any inconvenience this incident may cause. Our customers are our top priority and we are committed to working with our franchise owners to address the issue. 
We are notifying DQ and Orange Julius customers about this incident so they can take steps to help protect their information. You are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. We

President and Chief Executive Officer & names, payment card numbers and expiration dates	The organization's investigation revealed that a third-party vendor's compromised account credentials were used to access the systems at certain DQ and Orange Julius locations in the U.S., infecting them with the widely-reported Backoff malware that is targeting retailers across the country. As a result, customers' names, payment card numbers, and expiration dates were compromised.
As part of a multi-step initiative to fully encrypt the servers at all of our locations, a
scheduled server replacement was performed on June 2, 2014 in our Visionworks
store at Jennifer Square, 169 Jennifer Road, Annapolis, Maryland. Following the
replacement, the partially encrypted decommissioned server was placed in a box and
stored temporarily in the in-store lab until it was recalled and shipped back to the
San Antonio home office. On October 27, 2014, the server was recalled, and it was
discovered that it was missing from the store.
An investigation immediately ensued which revealed that a remodel of the store
began on June 15, 2014, shortly after the server replacement. The investigation
further revealed that significant amounts of construction material and debris was
removed from the store and disposed of in construction dumpsters during that time.
Although we are unable to conclusively confirm, all of the facts of the investigation
suggest, and we strongly suspect, that the server was placed into the dumpster used
for construction waste by either an employee or contractor. We have every reason
to conclude that the server is now buried in a local landfill.
Our investigation further revealed that the server's hard drive contained fewer than
100 records of encrypted credit card holder data ("CHO") which was stored for three
(3) days from the time of the transaction (i.e., the encrypted, unreadable CHO
impacted includes data from May 31, 2014, through June 2, 2014, when the server
was decommissioned). The server's hard drive also contained unencrypted Pl and
PHI from the store's opening in 1997 through June 2, 2014. There was no customer
data on this server after June 2, 2014. & As part of the investigation, we have attempted to identify the types of unencrypted
data on the server. The missing data included the following data elements: name;
address; home and work telephone numbers; health insurance information, including
group name, group number, vision care expiration date and a member ID with up to
13 digits; date of birth; gender; occupation; referral source; service type and purpose
of the visit; date of last visit; current balance; patient status; work order information,
including examination information, comments and several eye glass frame, optical
prescription and production related fields; and encrypted CHO.

There were also two Social Security Number ("SSN") fields available in the database;
however, those fields were not populated. In some very limited cases, the member
ID field may contain a SSN embedded within the full member ID; however, the field
was not labeled as a SSN, and there is no reason to believe that anyone would
identify this number as containing a SSN.	The breach involved the loss of a partially encrypted server that was stored in a box in-store and later went missing after store remodeling. The server contained unencrypted personal health information (PHI) and protected credit card holder data (CHO). Although we are unable to conclusively confirm, all of the facts of the investigation suggest, and we strongly suspect, that the server was placed into the dumpster used for construction waste by either an employee or contractor.
At this time, it appears that an unauthorized third person or
persons obtained access to that system between November 2013 and March 2014, although that is still being confirmed.
We do want to make you aware of what personal data of yours was in the payroll data system and may have been accessed by the unauthorized person:

Protecting customer information is critically important to Hyatt. We have been working tirelessly
to complete our previously announced investigation regarding malware that targeted payment
card data used at Hyatt-managed locations. We now have more complete information we want to
share so that you can take steps to protect yourself.
The investigation identified signs of unauthorized access to payment card data from cards used
onsite at certain Hyatt-managed locations, primarily at restaurants, between August 13, 2015 and
December 8, 2015. A small percentage of the at-risk cards were used at spas, golf shops, parking,
and a limited number of front desks, or provided to a sales office during this time period. The atrisk
window for a limited number of locations began on or shortly after July 30, 2015.
The ma I ware was designed to collect payment card data - cardholder name, card number,
expiration date and internal verification code - from cards used onsite as the data was being
routed through affected payment processing systems. There is no indication that other customer
infomrntion was affected. The list of affected Hyatt locations and respective at-risk dates is
available at www.hvatt.com/protectingourcustomers.
We worked quickly with leading third-party cyber security experts to resolve the issue and
strengthen the security of our systems in order to help prevent this from happening in the future.
We also notified law enforcement and the payment card networks. Please be assured that you can
confidently use payment cards at Hyatt hotels worldwide. & The ma I ware was designed to collect payment card data - cardholder name, card number,

Our clients, Landry's, Inc., Golden Nugget Atlantic City, LLC, Golden Nugget Lake
Charles, LLC, GNL Corp., GNLV Corp., and Riverboat Corporation of Mississippi (collectively
"the Companies"), understand the importance of protecting payment card information. On
December 3, 2015, the Companies received a report from their payment card processor of
suspicious activity regarding payment cards that had been used legitimately at some of their
locations. The Companies immediately began an investigation and hired a leading cyber security
firm to examine their payment card system. The Companies also contacted the payment card
networks and law enforcement about the incident.
Findings from the investigation show that criminal attackers were able to install a
program on payment card processing devices at certain of the Companies' restaurants, food and
beverage outlets, spas, entertainment destinations, and managed properties. The program was
designed to search for data from the magnetic stripe of payment cards that had been swiped
(cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code) as the data was
being routed through affected systems. Locations were affected at different times during one or
both of the following periods: from May 4, 2014 through March 15, 2015 and from May 5, 2015
through December 3, 2015. In addition, the at-risk timeframe for a small percentage of locations
includes the period from March 16, 2015 through May 4, 2015. & The program was
designed to search for data from the magnetic stripe of payment cards that had been swiped
(cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code) as the data was
being routed through affected systems.

may have been compromised in the incident, specifying the elements of that individual's personally
identifiable information that may have been accessed.	The information states that there was "computer intrusion" against a "vendor-supplied external system" which suggests that the breach was caused by an outside party hacking into Western Union's system.
This incident first came to Gyft's attention on December 3, 2015, when it learned that a file available on the Internet appeared to contain Gyft user records. It was not immediately apparent how the file had been created, and Gyft did not discover that its cloud providers had been accessed without authorization until approximately December 28, 2015. The unknown individual(s) that accessed the cloud providers used valid Gyft credentials. As of the date of this letter, Gyft has not determined how the credentials were obtained or who obtained them. 
When Gyft became aware of this incident, it appeared that log files, including usernames and passwords, dating as far back as March 19, 2015 had been compromised. Accordingly, Gyft immediately reset user passwords for all users who had logged in during that time period. Upon identifying unauthorized logins to its cloud providers, Gyft reviewed all files stored with the cloud providers that were potentially accessed without authorization, and is notifying all Gyft users whose sensitive personal information was available in the potentially accessed files. Gyft has also forced password resets and/or logouts for additional affected users as those users were identified.& names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and gift card numbers	The breach involved unauthorized access to the organization's cloud providers without authorization.
Specifically, on March 7, 2016, a third party obtained unauthorized access to employee information. This access was through a phishing-type attack in which an outside party posing as an Advance employee convinced an 
employee to provide a file containing information about certain individuals who worked for Advance during 2015. The employee believed the email request for this file was a legitimate internal data request. Through our 
investigation, we have determined that the third party had access to an employee's name and Social Security 
number, 2015 gross wages and the state(s) in which the employee files income taxes.& name and Social Security 
number, 2015 gross wages and the state(s) in which the employee files income taxes	The breach was caused by an outside party who obtained unauthorized access through a phishing-type attack.
What Happened? The Resort began investigating unusual activity after receiving reports from its credit card processor. The Resort immediately began working with third-party forensic 
experts to investigate these reports and to identify any signs of compromise on its computer 
systems. On October 21, 2016, the Resort discovered suspicious files on its computer systems that indicated a potential compromise of customers' credit and debit card data for some credit and debit cards used at food and beverage and retail locations at the resort. 
Since that time, the Resort has been working with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and what information was affected. The Resort has confirmed that malware may have captured data from some credit and debit cards used at food and beverage and retail 
locations at the Resort. The Resort has removed the malware at issue to contain this incident and implemented additional procedures in an effort to prevent any further unauthorized access to 
customers' credit and debit card information. This incident did not affect credit and debit cards used to make or pay for hotel reservations or purchases made by guests who charged their food and beverage or retail purchases back to their room.& Wltat /11formatio11 Was Involved? Through the ongoing third-party forensic investigations, the Resort confirmed that malware may have captured credit and debit card data from some credit and debit cards used at food and beverage and retai 1 locations between March 9, 2016 and 
October 22, 2016. The information at risk as a result of this event for credit or debit cards used at the impacted locations includes the card number, expiration date, CYV and in some instances, cardholder name. This incident did not involve customers' Social Security numbers as this 
information is never collected by the Resort. This incident did not involve customers' PIN 
numbers, either.	The breach involved fraud involving credit and debit cards used at food and beverage and retail locations at the resort, captured by malware on the Resort's computer systems between March 9, 2016 and October 22, 2016.
From approximately August I, 2015 through November 9, 2015, the websites' checkout page where customers
input their payment information to purchase products from JB Autosports was the target of a cyberattack
originating from a Russian lP address. The breach affected customers who used Visa, MasterCard, Discover,
and American Express branded cards to pay for their purchases from the websites. The breach allowed
cyberanackers to intercept customer names, addresses, credit card numbers. credit card expiration dates, CID
numbers, CA V2 numbers, CVC2 numbers, and CVV2 n_umbers ("Customer Information"). The Customer
lnfomiation was intercepted after it was entered on the checkout page as it was being transmitted to PayPal for
processing. JB Autosports' policy is to not sLore customer credit card information.
Since detecting the breach, JB Autosports has made every effort to mitigate the damage by contracting with a
Lhird-party vendor to identify the source of the breach and implement security solutions Lo prevent a recurrence
of the breach. J B Autosporls has also improved its cybersecurity defenses to prevent future breaches of
Customer Jnformation. In addition, JB Autospo1ts has had major credit card networks and Pay Pal notified of the

Olympia Hotel Management, manager of the Brunswick Hotel & Tavern located at 4 Noble Street,
Brunswick, Maine, recently discovered malware on the hotel's computer systems that may have
resulted in unauthorized access to name and payment card information. As a recent guest of the hotel,
we are writing to provide you with information about this incident, to share the steps that we are taking
in response, and to provide you with important information about the steps you can take to reduce the
risk of unauthorized use of your personal information. We regret any inconvenience this incident may
have caused.
What happened:
Based on our investigation to date, it appears that one of the front desk computers at the hotel was
infected with sophisticated malware designed to capture and permit remote access to name and
payment card information while avoiding detection by anti-virus software. On August 12, 2015, our
security consultants determined that the malware may have been active on that front desk system
between November 29, 2014 and July 21, 2015. As a result, your information may have been exposed.
Although we do not have conclusive evidence that your information was actually accessed remotely, we
have not been able to rule that out and encourage you to take advantage of the credit monitoring and
other resources we provide below. & name and payment card information	The malware on the hotel's computer systems that may have resulted in unauthorized access to name and payment card information is indicative of a hack.
Findings from the investigation show that an unauthorized person installed malware on certain servers that processed payment cards used at some of our hotels. The malware searched for track data read from the magnetic stripe of payment cards as it was being routed through the affected servers. The malware primarily found track data that contained the card number, expiration date, and internal verification code, but in some instances it found the track that also contains the cardholder name. & The malware primarily found track data that contained the card number, expiration date, and internal verification code, but in some instances it found the track that also contains the cardholder name.	The unauthorized person installed malware on certain servers at Kimpton Hotels, allowing them to collect payment card information including track data containing card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes as well as some cardholder names.
On behalf of my client, Schwan's Horne Service, Inc. ("Schwan's"), please allow this correspondence to serve as written notification that CARDSource, a third-party vendor which produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the Schwan 'sPayÂ® accounts of my client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the records of 323 IA Schwan 's customers, as of August I, 2016 may have been exposed to a hacker of foreign origin as far back as October 9, 2015. While there is no record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the CARDSource systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively considered by Schwan's to be compromised. 
These records were held by CARDSource in a contracted data center, and contained the following information for those 323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number. The Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number ties directly to each customer's Schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on file with Schwan's. All 323 affected Schwan'sPayÂ® cards on file with CARDSource have been disabled by Schwan's out of an abundance of caution, and upon thorough review, no fraudulent or even questionable activity has been detected in those customers' accounts. The likelihood of actual harm, financial or otherwise, is by my client's reasonable calculation to be extremely low or non-existent due to the fact that the card can only be used for purchases with Schwan's and alignment of all three accounts is necessary for a debit transaction; however, the possibility of phishing or social engineering scams cannot be entirely ruled out.& name, address, phone number, email address and Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number	The breach involved the compromise of 323 Schwan'sPay® card numbers and other personal information, held by a third-party vendor, CARDSource, that produces payment cards tied solely to the Schwan's account of the company's customers.

Dear DQ and Orange Julius Customers, 
International Dairy Queen, Inc. recently learned of a possible malware intrusion that may have affected some payment cards at certain DQ@ locations and one Orange JuliusÂ® 
location in the U.S. Upon learning of the issue, wc launched an extensive investigation and retained external forensic experts to help determine the facts. Because nearly all DQ and Orange Julius locations are independently owned and operated, we worked closely with affected franchise owners, as well as law enforcement authorities and the payment card brands, to assess the nature and scope of the issue. As a result of our investigation, we discovered evidence that the systems of some DQ locations and one Orange Julius 
location were infected with the widely-reported Backoff malware that is targeting 
retailers across the country. The investigation revealed that a third-party vendor's 
compromised account credentials were used to access systems at those locations. 
Based on the investigation, we have established the following: 
â€¢ The Backoffmalware was present on systems at a small percentage of locations in the U.S.
â€¢ The time periods during which the Backoff malware was present on the affected systems vary by location. A list of impacted DQ locations and the one Orange
Julius location, as well as the relevant time periods, is available here.
â€¢ The affected systems contained customers' names, payment card numbers and
expiration dates. We have no evidence that other customer personal information, such as Social Security numbers, PINs or email addresses, were compromised as a result of this malware infection.
â€¢ Based on our investigation, we are confident that this malware has been
contained.
We deeply regret any inconvenience this incident may cause. Our customers are our top priority and we are committed to working with our franchise owners to address the issue.

As part of a multi-step initiative to fully encrypt the servers at all of our locations, a
scheduled server replacement was performed on June 2, 2014 in our Visionworks
store at Jennifer Square, 169 Jennifer Road, Annapolis, Maryland. Following the
replacement, the partially encrypted decommissioned server was placed in a box and
stored temporarily in the in-store lab until it was recalled and shipped back to the
San Antonio home office. On October 27, 2014, the server was recalled, and it was
discovered that it was missing from the store.
An investigation immediately ensued which revealed that a remodel of the store
began on June 15, 2014, shortly after the server replacement. The investigation
further revealed that significant amounts of construction material and debris was
removed from the store and disposed of in construction dumpsters during that time.
Although we are unable to conclusively confirm, all of the facts of the investigation
suggest, and we strongly suspect, that the server was placed into the dumpster used
for construction waste by either an employee or contractor. We have every reason
to conclude that the server is now buried in a local landfill.
Our investigation further revealed that the server's hard drive contained fewer than
100 records of encrypted credit card holder data ("CHO") which was stored for three
(3) days from the time of the transaction (i.e., the encrypted, unreadable CHO
impacted includes data from May 31, 2014, through June 2, 2014, when the server
was decommissioned). The server's hard drive also contained unencrypted Pl and
PHI from the store's opening in 1997 through June 2, 2014. There was no customer
data on this server after June 2, 2014. & As part of the investigation, we have attempted to identify the types of unencrypted
data on the server. The missing data included the following data elements: name;
address; home and work telephone numbers; health insurance information, including
group name, group number, vision care expiration date and a member ID with up to
13 digits; date of birth; gender; occupation; referral source; service type and purpose
of the visit; date of last visit; current balance; patient status; work order information,
including examination information, comments and several eye glass frame, optical
prescription and production related fields; and encrypted CHO.

There were also two Social Security Number ("SSN") fields available in the database;
however, those fields were not populated. In some very limited cases, the member
ID field may contain a SSN embedded within the full member ID; however, the field
was not labeled as a SSN, and there is no reason to believe that anyone would
identify this number as containing a SSN.	The breach involved the physical loss of a partially encrypted decommissioned server that was temporarily stored in a box within the store and was later discovered missing.
At this time, it appears that an unauthorized third person or
persons obtained access to that system between November 2013 and March 2014, although that is still being confirmed.

Protecting customer information is critically important to Hyatt. We have been working tirelessly
to complete our previously announced investigation regarding malware that targeted payment
card data used at Hyatt-managed locations. We now have more complete information we want to
share so that you can take steps to protect yourself.
The investigation identified signs of unauthorized access to payment card data from cards used
onsite at certain Hyatt-managed locations, primarily at restaurants, between August 13, 2015 and
December 8, 2015. A small percentage of the at-risk cards were used at spas, golf shops, parking,
and a limited number of front desks, or provided to a sales office during this time period. The atrisk
window for a limited number of locations began on or shortly after July 30, 2015.
The ma I ware was designed to collect payment card data - cardholder name, card number,
expiration date and internal verification code - from cards used onsite as the data was being
routed through affected payment processing systems. There is no indication that other customer
infomrntion was affected. The list of affected Hyatt locations and respective at-risk dates is
available at www.hvatt.com/protectingourcustomers.
We worked quickly with leading third-party cyber security experts to resolve the issue and
strengthen the security of our systems in order to help prevent this from happening in the future.
We also notified law enforcement and the payment card networks. Please be assured that you can
confidently use payment cards at Hyatt hotels worldwide. & The ma I ware was designed to collect payment card data - cardholder name, card number,

Our clients, Landry's, Inc., Golden Nugget Atlantic City, LLC, Golden Nugget Lake
Charles, LLC, GNL Corp., GNLV Corp., and Riverboat Corporation of Mississippi (collectively
"the Companies"), understand the importance of protecting payment card information. On
December 3, 2015, the Companies received a report from their payment card processor of
suspicious activity regarding payment cards that had been used legitimately at some of their
locations. The Companies immediately began an investigation and hired a leading cyber security
firm to examine their payment card system. The Companies also contacted the payment card
networks and law enforcement about the incident.
Findings from the investigation show that criminal attackers were able to install a
program on payment card processing devices at certain of the Companies' restaurants, food and
beverage outlets, spas, entertainment destinations, and managed properties. The program was
designed to search for data from the magnetic stripe of payment cards that had been swiped
(cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code) as the data was
being routed through affected systems. Locations were affected at different times during one or
both of the following periods: from May 4, 2014 through March 15, 2015 and from May 5, 2015
through December 3, 2015. In addition, the at-risk timeframe for a small percentage of locations

This incident first came to Gyft's attention on December 3, 2015, when it learned that a file available on the Internet appeared to contain Gyft user records. It was not immediately apparent how the file had been created, and Gyft did not discover that its cloud providers had been accessed without authorization until approximately December 28, 2015. The unknown individual(s) that accessed the cloud providers used valid Gyft credentials. As of the date of this letter, Gyft has not determined how the credentials were obtained or who obtained them. 
When Gyft became aware of this incident, it appeared that log files, including usernames and passwords, dating as far back as March 19, 2015 had been compromised. Accordingly, Gyft immediately reset user passwords for all users who had logged in during that time period. Upon identifying unauthorized logins to its cloud providers, Gyft reviewed all files stored with the cloud providers that were potentially accessed without authorization, and is notifying all Gyft users whose sensitive personal information was available in the potentially accessed files. Gyft has also forced password resets and/or logouts for additional affected users as those users were identified.& names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and gift card numbers	The breach was caused by an outside party who gained unauthorized access to Gyft's cloud providers through valid Gyft credentials. The exact method of acquiring these credentials is unknown to Gyft as of the time of notification.
What Happened? The Resort began investigating unusual activity after receiving reports from its credit card processor. The Resort immediately began working with third-party forensic 
experts to investigate these reports and to identify any signs of compromise on its computer 
systems. On October 21, 2016, the Resort discovered suspicious files on its computer systems that indicated a potential compromise of customers' credit and debit card data for some credit and debit cards used at food and beverage and retail locations at the resort. 
Since that time, the Resort has been working with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and what information was affected. The Resort has confirmed that malware may have captured data from some credit and debit cards used at food and beverage and retail 
locations at the Resort. The Resort has removed the malware at issue to contain this incident and implemented additional procedures in an effort to prevent any further unauthorized access to

infected with sophisticated malware designed to capture and permit remote access to name and
payment card information while avoiding detection by anti-virus software. On August 12, 2015, our
security consultants determined that the malware may have been active on that front desk system
between November 29, 2014 and July 21, 2015. As a result, your information may have been exposed.

On behalf of my client, Schwan's Horne Service, Inc. ("Schwan's"), please allow this correspondence to serve as written notification that CARDSource, a third-party vendor which produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the Schwan 'sPayÂ® accounts of my client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the records of 323 IA Schwan 's customers, as of August I, 2016 may have been exposed to a hacker of foreign origin as far back as October 9, 2015. While there is no record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the CARDSource systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively considered by Schwan's to be compromised. 
These records were held by CARDSource in a contracted data center, and contained the following information for those 323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number. The Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number ties directly to each customer's Schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on file with Schwan's. All 323 affected Schwan'sPayÂ® cards on file with CARDSource have been disabled by Schwan's out of an abundance of caution, and upon thorough review, no fraudulent or even questionable activity has been detected in those customers' accounts. The likelihood of actual harm, financial or otherwise, is by my client's reasonable calculation to be extremely low or non-existent due to the fact that the card can only be used for purchases with Schwan's and alignment of all three accounts is necessary for a debit transaction; however, the possibility of phishing or social engineering scams cannot be entirely ruled out.& name, address, phone number, email address and Schwan 'sPayÂ® card number	The breach involved the compromise of payment card related information for customers of Schwan's Home Service Corporation due to a hack affecting a third-party vendor.

What Happened?
On July 26, 2019, StockX was alerted to suspicious activity potentially involving customer data. We immediately
launched a forensic investigation and engaged experienced third-party experts to assist. During this first week, while
our forensic investigation into the suspicious activity was underway, we took proactive and precautionary measures
to protect our customers. As described in greater detail in the â€œwhat are we doingâ€ section below, we deployed a
system-wide update, implemented a full password reset of all customer passwords for all StockX accounts, and on
the morning of August 1, 2019 sent customers an email alerting them to the systems update and password reset.

As part of our efforts to catch the perpetrator, we have contacted law enforcement and have been working with them
in their investigation of the incident. Our investigation into the nature, extent, and scope of the incident remains
ongoing, and we will update you with additional information as necessary. & What Information Was Involved?
From our investigation to date, the information affected may include your name, email address, address, username,
hashed password, and purchase history.
As indicated in our prior communications, there is no evidence to date to suggest that any of your financial or
payment information has been affected. That is because StockX does not store full payment card or financial data
of its customers on its network servers or platform. Instead, any StockX payment card data is processed, stored, and
hosted by a third-party payment processor, and not StockX. Based on our investigation to date, we have no evidence
to suggest that our third-party payment processing partners or our third-party platform has been affected by this
incident, nor do we have any evidence to suggest that any of the customer financial or payment information stored
by that third-party has been affected.	An unknown third party was able to gain unauthorized access to certain customer data from the cloud environment on or around May 14, 2019. The breach was discovered by the organization on July 26, 2019.

On April 22, 2019, three PINN servers were infected with ransomware, which was discovered on April 23, 2019. PINN immediately took those servers offline and was able to restore most of the data from back-ups. To ensure that PINN's systems were secure and determine if any data was compromised, PINN retained a computer forensics firm to analyze the servers. That firm did not find any evidence that personal information was accessed or exfiltrated by the attacker, but it also could not rule out the possibility of access or exfiltration. Because the servers at issue contained personal information for PINN patients through April 22, 2019, PINN is erring on the side of caution and concluding that all such infonnation could be at risk. Accordingly, we're providing trus notice to you. What Information Was Involved The information at issue could include your name, address, date of birth, driver's license number, and diagnosis information.& name, address, date of birth, driver's license number, and diagnosis information	The breach involves ransomware infestation on the organization's servers through which personal information of patients were potentially at risk.

unauthorized access by former agent; name, address, phone number, Social Security number, date of birth, drivers license number, employer information, bank account number, and responses to health questions & On July 22, 2019, AIL discovered that a former independent agent used
another agentâ€™s credentials to gain unauthorized access to a limited number of life insurance
applications submitted in the past. We believe the former agent may have had unauthorized
access to the life insurance applications dated April 2017 to July 2019. This is a local issue
limited to one AIL independent contractor agency office. Upon the discovery of this
information, we began an inquiry into the nature and scope of the incident and we brought in
outside assistance to conduct a more detailed review of the event. & As noted above, we donâ€™t have any information that your
specific information was viewed, but the former insurance agent possibly had access to your life
insurance application, including certain personal information from your application such as: your
name, address, phone number, Social Security number, date of birth, driverâ€™s license number,
employer information, bank account number, and your responses to health questions.	The breach was caused by unauthorized access gained through the use of a former agent's credentials, indicating an external party gained access. The sensitive personal information accessed, including social security numbers and bank account numbers, suggests that this was a hacking incident.

investigation to determine the full nature and scope of this incident. Through a detailed and exhaustive investigation,
we confirmed that an unknown actor(s) gained access to certain Federation employee email accounts as the result
of a phishing attack. The employeesâ€™ email credentials were changed, and the email accounts have been secured. A

information contained within the email accounts may have been affected. The investigation determined that an unknown
individual had accessed certain Federation employeesâ€™ email accounts as early as September 12, 2018.

was contained in the accounts. We conducted a review, confirming the identities of the individuals, impacted data
elements and relevant address information, which was completed on July 30, 2019.
