On or around June 14, 2018, ABM was alerted to suspicious activity related to certain employee email accounts.
ABM immediately launched an investigation into the incident to determine the full nature and scope of what occurred.
Through its detailed and exhaustive investigation, ABM confirmed that an unknown actor gained access to certain ABM
employee email accounts as the result of a phishing attack against the email accounts. Phishing is a type of electronic
attack where outside individuals impersonate a trusted person or company to obtain information, such as email
credentials. The affected employees' email credentials were changed, and the email accounts have been secured.
A leading forensic investigation firm was immediately retained to assist with ABM's investigation into what happened
and what information contained within the email accounts may be affected. The investigation determined that the
accounts at issue experienced unauthorized access between January 8, 2018 and August 7, 2018. The contents of
the accounts were reviewed through an in-depth manual and programmatic process to determine what sensitive data
may have been accessible. On December 26, 2018, we confirmed the identities of the individuals who may have had
information accessible as a result of the incident and promptly launched a review of our files to ascertain address
information for the impacted individuals.& While we currently have no evidence that your information was subject to actual or attempted misuse, we have confirmed
that your Â«ClientDef1(name and [Data Elements])Â»Â«ClientDef2[Data Elements)Â» were contained within the affected

third parties, simply that it was accessible to be opened and potentially reviewed by the unknown actor.	The breach appears to have been caused by a phishing attack against employee email accounts resulting in unauthorized access to those accounts.

What Happened?
Beginning on or about March 29, 2019 through and including May 6, 2019, Symmetry received ten email
communications that appeared to be from Carl Smith or CJS Financial containing fraudulent transaction
requests, regarding six of his customers. No other customers of Symmetry were involved in any way; only
customers of CJS Financial were involved. At the time, the requests appeared genuine because they came
from a CJS Financial email account and had correct account information as well as the correct E*Trade
custody information; along with an accurate copy of your signature; and so the requests were honored.
Subsequently, Symmetry was informed that these requests were fraudulent.
To help understand the situation, Symmetry hired a leading thirdâ€party computer forensic expert, Stroz
Friedberg, an Aon Company, to review its systems. On June 4, 2019, Stroz Friedberg issued a report
concluding that the fraudulent emails were likely sent from CJS Financialâ€™s system, and that Symmetry did
not suffer a breach of its email system. Based on this report, our understanding is that Symmetryâ€™s computer
system data have not been improperly accessed or compromised.
Unfortunately, we do not have insight into the computer environment at CJS Financial, and they have not
agreed to give us access to the relevant logs. Accordingly, your best source of further information about this
incident is by contacting CJS Financial by mail at 1 Tara Boulevard, Ste. 200, Nashua NH 03062 or by phone
at (954) 825â€0309. & What Information Was Involved?
Although the investigation is continuing, we currently believe that a third party may have accessed all of your
personal account data held at CJS Financial, including full account information, social security numbers,
name, and address. Because any potential compromise of your information did not occur at Symmetry and
we do not have access to the files of CJS Financial, we are unable to provide particular information about
what information was actually involved.	The fraudulent transaction requests were made by someone using information from a CJS Financial email account, suggesting that debit or credit card information may have been obtained fraudulently.
Breach occurred through a vendor website (PrismRBS) that manages our online bookstore sales.	The breach was caused by an outside party hacking the vendor website that managed the organization's online bookstore sales.

The data includes 140,000 Social Security numbers, 80,000 bank account numbers, and one million Social Insurance Numbers (SINs) for Canadian credit card customers. According to Capital One, no credit card account numbers or login credentials were exposed. The breach exposed data on customers and small businesses who applied for credit card products from 2005 to early 2019, revealing names, addresses, postal codes, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and self-reported income. Capital One became aware of the breach through a tip received on July 17 indicating that some of their data was made public on GitHub. On July 29, Paige Thompson was arrested for suspicion of downloading nearly 30 GB of Capital One data via a rented cloud data server. Capital One released a statement addressing the breach and additional information can be found in the KrebsOnSecurity post. Impacted customers are advised to monitor their credit profile for suspicious activity and consider placing credit freezes. & names, addresses, postal codes, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and self-reported income	The breach was caused by an outside party, who hacked into Capital One's systems and obtained sensitive information of millions of customers who had applied for credit card products from 2005 to early 2019. The hacker was able to obtain this data by exploiting a software vulnerability and then exfiltrated it via a rented cloud data server.
We detected a phishing email incident in April 2019 that involved an unauthorized person gaining access to certain Govia
employees' email accounts. As soon as we learned about the incident, we immediately secured the employees' email
accounts and began an investigation & Since receiving the initial results of that review on June 14, 2019, Covia has been
working to identify contact information for each of the individuals with personal information
involved.	The unauthorized access to certain Covia employees' email accounts in April 2019 suggests that this is a result of external hacking.
What Happened?
On or about May 22, 2019, one of our employees received an email that was carefully crafted to
appear to be from one of our recruiting vendors, Workable, with a link. The link led to a website
requesting the employee's Outlook login credentials. Unfortunately, this email was fraudulent
and did not actually come from within our company or Workable. Rather, it was a "phishing"
email from a person or entity outside the company that clearly made the email appear as if it
came from Workable, and caused our employee to provide her login credentials. We have
confirmed that this outside entity used the login credentials to gain access to our employee's
Outlook account.
On or about June 13, 2019, we discovered that the employee's Outlook account included a file
containing personal information of other employees. We have no reason to believe this file was
accessed by the outside entity or sent outside the company. We are sending this notice, however,
out of an abundance of caution. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or concern this
may cause. & What Information Was Involved?
The personal information in the file mentioned above contained your name and social security
number. Again, we have no indication to date that that file was taken or even accessed, and we
have not received any reports of improper use of any of this information.	The breach involved the physical loss of paper documents containing personal information.

Because a small percentage of customer reported identity theft beginning in June, TBIM took the following actions: launched an investigation to try to determine if a compromise of the TBIM system is responsible for the reported identity thefts; retained a nationally-recognized cybersecurity firm; and instituted measures to strengthen security controls throughout the system. TBIM also notified and is continuing to work closely with the vendor partners who provide cloud-based software, customer portal management, credit reports, and other discrete components of the loan application process. These third parties have advised TBIM that they have not identified any compromises in their systems. Although two cybersecurity investigation firms have not found any compromise of TBIMs computer systems, and the majority of TBIMs customers do not appear to have been affected; TBIM continues to receive reports of identity theft from loan applicants. Accordingly, notice to potentially affected residents is being provided while the investigation is continuing and additional security controls and system monitoring have been implemented.	It is unclear from the information provided what type of breach occurred as there is no clear indication of how the identity theft occurred or if it involved hacking, insider access, physical theft, or unintended disclosure. The investigation and measures taken suggest that it could have possibly been a hack, but without more information, it cannot be definitively classified.

Earlier this year, Adams 12 became aware of unusual activity from an outside source accessing an Adams 12
employeeâ€™s email account. We immediately began an investigation to determine what happened and what information
may have been affected. With the assistance of third-party forensic investigators, we determined that certain
employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized access from outside sources between February 15, and
February 19, 2019. Because the initial assessment was unable to identify what, if any, emails were viewed without
authorization, we began an extensive investigation to understand all information within the email accounts that
was potentially accessible. Following a thorough and resource-intensive review of the contents of the accounts, on
June 12, 2019, Adams 12 determined that the accounts subject to unauthorized access contained protected information
of certain individuals, including you.
Based upon available forensic evidence, Adams 12 was unable to confirm whether the email or document containing your
information was actually viewed by an unauthorized user. Our investigation was only able to determine your information was
present in emails and/or attachments in the email accounts subject to unauthorized access. & What Information Was Involved?
The email accounts subject to unauthorized access contained the following types of information relating to you: your
<<ClientDef1>><<ClientDef2>>. To date, we have not received any reports of actual or attempted misuse of personal
information potentially affected by this incident.	Based on the given information, it seems that the unauthorized access of the employee email account was not due to hacking or physical loss. Instead, it was an unintended disclosure of personal information through email attachments that were accessed without authorization by an outside party.

IMPORTANT NOTICE OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER
THE MASSACHUSETTS DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LAW IM.G.L. c. 93H, â€€3)
You have the right to obtain any police report filed in regard to this incident. If you are the victim of
identity theft, you also have the right to file a police report and obtain a copy of it.
You may place a security freeze on your credit reports. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting
agency from releasing any information from a consumer's credit report without written authorization.
You should be aware, however, that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere
with, or prevent the timely approval of any request for a new loan, credit, mortgage, employment,
housing or other services.
To place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written requestto each of the three
major consumer reporting agencies: Equifax (www.equifax.com), Experian (www.experian.com), and
Trans Union (www.transunion.com) by regular, certified or overnight mail at the addresses below:
Equifax Security Freeze
P.O. Box 105788

Experian Security Freeze
P.O. Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013
Trans Union Security Freeze
Fraud Victim Assistance Department
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022
In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:
1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, Ill, etc.);
2. Social Security Number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over
the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver's license or ID

report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft;
8. If you are not a victim of identity theft, include payment by check, money order, or credit card
(Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover only). Do not send cash through the mail.
The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a
security freeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to
you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number
(PIN) or password, or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the
security freeze.
To lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report,
you must call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper
identification (name, address, and social security number) and the PIN number or password
provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identities of those entities or
individuals youwould like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the
credit report available. The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving
your request to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time.
To remove the security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus
by mail and include proper identification (name, address, and social security number) and the PIN
number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze. The credit bureaus have
three (3) business days after receiving your request to remove the security freeze.
Alternatively, you may place a free fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any one of the

about your alert. The initial alert stays on your report for at least 90 days, but you can renew it after
90 days. When you have an alert on your report, a business must verify your identity before it issues
credit, so it may try to contact you. Be sure the credit reporting agencies have your current contact

On September 3, 2019, we discovered that an unknown and unauthorized third party had tried accessing user
accounts on August 19, August 27 and September 3, and had gained access to the mailbox of one of our
employees, which contained personal information.

security to the impacted account.

wide-ranging forensic review to determine the scope of the intrusion, including the data that may have been
compromised as a result of the incident. At all times, the priority of the investigation was to assess the risk to
individuals in order to notify those impacted as soon as possible and continue to protect the data that we hold.

information. The County's internal IT team immediately launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the
incident. On or around January 7, 2019, the County's investigation identified unauthorized access to numerous County
employee email accounts and County employee PeopleSoft accounts as a result of a credentials harvesting phishing
email. We immediately launched an investigation to determine what may have happened and what information may
have been affected. Working together with a leading computer forensics expert, our investigation determined that an
unauthorized individual or individuals accessed the email account between November 20, 2018 and January 2, 2019.

unauthorized actor, we reviewed the contents of the email accounts to identify what personal information was stored
within ii. On April 1, 2019, after a thorough review of the email accounts, we confirmed that the affected email accounts
contained sensitive information, and identified the individuals potentially impacted by this incident. Once we confirmed
the individuals who were potentially impacted, the County worked to identify the best possible contact information for
the impacted individuals and then began preparing an accurate written notice of this incident.

through Wednesday, August 21, 2019 the website had an active file allowing an unauthorized party to capture credit card
information as it was entered for order processing (we do not store credit card information). Within two hours of receiving
the information, the team removed the vulnerability from the site. & The compromised information included first names and last names, shipping and billing addresses, email, phone number,
and credit card information. It did not include your password, date of birth, or Social Security number (which we do not
collect). At this time, there is no evidence that your information has been misused.	The breach involved the unauthorized party capturing credit card information as it was being entered for order processing, but the organization does not store credit card information.

2019-05-07 00:00:00	There is no information provided on the type of breach.
What Happened? Calibre recently became aware of suspicious activity related to certain employee email accounts, as
well as one of our computer servers. We immediately launched an investigation to determine the full nature and scope
of the email activity and what information may have been affected. With the assistance of computer forensics experts,
we learned that one of our computer servers as well as certain Calibre employee email accounts were accessed without
authorization between March 11, 2019 and May 7, 2019.
Working with these third-party experts, we undertook a comprehensive review of the impacted email accounts and
impacted server to determine if they contained personal information and received confirmation on the number of
potentially impacted individuals on June 26, 2019. However, based on the information contained within the affected
data, we still lacked complete information related to the potentially affected individuals and were unable to adequately
identify the various organizations and/or businesses from whom the information originated. We subsequently undertook
a lengthy internal review of our systems and determined that information related to you was accessible during the period
of potential compromise. Unfortunately, however, we are unable to determine if your personal information was actually
accessed during the incident.
We are therefore notifying you in an abundance of caution because your information was present and potentially
accessible at the time of the incident.
What Information Was Involved? Calibre cannot confirm specifically what information, if any, was viewed by the
unauthorized individual. We learned that the impacted email accounts contained images of some of Calibre's employer
payroll compliance audit reports and or schedules for employers that contribute to the Fund. However, Calibre's
investigation confirmed the information present at the time of the incident may include your <<b2b_text_1>>. This
information was in Calibre's possession for the purpose of conducting payroll compliance reviews of the employers who
make contributions to the Fund on your behalf. These reviews are used to confirm that your employers reported the
correct number of hours, and paid the correct amount of contributions, to the Fund for your work. & your <<b2b_text_1>>	The unauthorized access of Calibre's computer server and employee email accounts suggests that this is a result of an outside party or malware infection. The statement "one of our computer servers as well as certain Calibre employee email accounts were accessed without authorization" confirms that this is a hack.

unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, dln, financial account info & On August 9, 2019, Northeastern concluded its investigation and analysis of a security incident.
Northeastern began its investigation after suspecting that unauthorized emails may have been sent from an
employeeâ€™s email account on May 1, 2019. Northeastern secured the employeeâ€™s email account and a
leading cyber security firm was engaged to assist with the investigation. Northeastern could not rule out
the possibility that unauthorized parties could have potentially accessed emails and attachments in the
employeeâ€™s email account between the dates of April 29, 2019 and May 1, 2019. Since this could not be
ruled out, Northeastern undertook a comprehensive review of the email account and determined that it may
have contained information pertaining to current and former clients and their beneficiaries. The information
varied by individual, but may have included names in combination with Social Security number, driverâ€™s
license number, and financial account information (bank account and routing numbers, and pin or security
codes). Significantly, and to date, there is no evidence that any of the personal information in the email
accounts was actually viewed or misused as a result of the incident. & The information

On August 8, 2019, PINN discovered that your personal information and PHI could potentially be at risk. On April 22,
2019, three PINN servers were infected with ransomware, which was discovered on April 23, 2019. PINN immediately
took those servers offline and was able to restore most of the data from back-ups. To ensure that PINN's systems were
secure and determine if any data was compromised, PINN retained a computer forensics firm to analyze the servers. That
firm did not find any evidence that personal information was accessed or exfiltrated by the attacker, but it also could not
rule out the possibility of access or exfiltration. Because the servers at issue contained personal information for PINN
patients through April 22, 2019, PINN is erring on the side of caution and concluding that all such information could be at
risk. Accordingly, we're providing this notice to you. & The information at issue could include your name, address, date of birth, driver's license number, and diagnosis information.	The breach was caused by a ransomware infection on three of PINN's servers. While PINN did not find evidence of personal information being accessed or stolen, it also could not rule out the possibility. Therefore, PINN is assuming that all such information could be at risk.

In August 2019, we detected unusual activity related to donor profiles within our
eDonor donor portal. A prompt investigation with our software vendor, Haemonetics
Software Solutions, revealed that between July 28th and 31st, 2019, and also
between August 14th and 22nd, a small number of blood donor profiles were
subject to unauthorized access on our donor portal website: bloodhero.com. It
appears that an unauthorized person gained access to the donor profiles and,
despite password protection, was able to log in and attempt to use donor reward
points. In some cases, donor loyalty program points were fraudulently redeemed to
order gift cards from Vitalant's Hero Rewards Store.
We notified impacted donors by email and asked them to change their password to
one that is more secure. For donors that did not respond to the email request, we
deactivated the current password in order to safeguard the donor's account and
information until a new password is created by the donor. In addition, we restored all
fraudulently redeemed loyalty program points to the affected donor accounts. & The information stored in your donor profile includes your name, date of birth, blood
type, donor ID number, gender, address, phone numbers (home, work and/or
mobile) and email address. The profile may also contain:
â€¢ Pending and past appointment information (date, time and location);
â€¢ Donation information, such as donation date, location and donation type (for
example, whole blood, platelets or plasma);
â€¢ Wellness information (blood pressure, pulse, cholesterol results, hemoglobin
level, temperature, height, weight and body mass index); and
â€¢ Loyalty program points you may have earned and/or redeemed.	The information suggests that a person gained access to the donor profiles through unauthorized access and attempted to use donor reward points. This label is chosen because the website was hacked and the information was accessed through unauthorized means.

A desktop computer and an external hard drive had been st len from an on-campus
office. At that time, based on available information, UVM was unable to verify whether the
devices contained any personal information. Monitoring triggers were put into place, which did
not indicate further activity on the devices; however, the investigation was closed.
Between November 12, 2018 and November 19, 2018, the desktop was located; however,
the external hard drive remains missing. At that time, UVM contracted with external forensics
experts to assist. On June 12, 2019, the forensics team confirmed that (i) the desktop had not
been powered on since it went missing; and (ii) the desktop contained some files that may
contain personally identifiable information and it is likely that these same files are on the
external hard drive. Most of the files that contained personally identifiable information were
emails or attachments to emails. On August 23, 2019, my office confirmed that a file on the
desktop contained your personally identifiable information. While the desktop had not been
accessed since it was stolen and while access to these emails requires a password, password
protection alone is not foolproof and someone with the right experience could likely gain access
to these :files. We are, therefore, providing you with this notice. & The file(s) that we identified as containing your personal information is/are:

had been accessed / acquired without authorization. Upon discovering this information, Lewes BPW immediately took 
steps to secure the data and launched an investigation. On May 29, 2019, I sent you an initial letter relating to this 
incident. Lewes BPW then engaged a leading, independent forensics firm to determine what happened and whether 
sensitive information was accessed or acquired without authorization as a result.& On August 6, 2019, that firm reported 
that an unauthorized actor acquired payment information stored within a Lewes BPW database for customers making 
recurring payments.	The breach involved unauthorized access to payment card information, as reported by the Maryland Attorney General.

Office 365 phishing campaign and subsequently used to access that employeeâ€™s e-mail to send a 
phishing email to the residentâ€™s emailbox.& Certain information belonging to that resident was 
embedded within that emailbox including the residentâ€™s name and social security number.	The breach was caused by an outside party using a phishing campaign to acquire employee credentials, ultimately leading to the compromise of certain resident information.
unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, dln, financial account number, payment card info & The investigation determined that the unauthorized 
access to the email account occurred for a few hours on May 2, 2019. Due to the nature of the 
unauthorized access, the investigation was unable to determine which specific emails or 
attachments, if any, may have been viewed by the unauthorized individual.& Because of this, GRF 
undertook a review of the emails and attachments and determined on July 12, 2019, that an 
attachment to an email contained the information of seven Maryland residents, including name, 
Social Security number, driver's license number, financial account number, and payment card 
number.	The unauthorized access to GRF's email account indicates that an outside party or malware was responsible for the data breach.

On Saturday, August 24, 2019, Paragon Marketing Group, LLC learned that an outside virus had infiltrated and was active on
their computer systems. Paragon promptly initiated standard remediation plans. Paragon successfully contained the virus and 
restored their systems, and they have also reported the matter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 
Concurrent with restoring Paragonâ€™s systems, they conducted an analysis to determine what data may have been lost or 
compromised. They were specifically concerned with the potential loss of personal data of current and former Paragon and 
GMP employees.& The analysis did not identify any such personal data was actually lost, but Paragon learned that the 
malicious actor at least had access for a period of time to Paragonâ€™s databases and reports that contained personal 
information of GMP and Paragon employees. Specifically, these reports contained the following types of data: name, address, 
phone number, date of birth, SSN, driverâ€™s license and bank details.	The breach was caused by an outside virus infiltration into the company's computer systems, indicating that it was hacked. The personal data of employees was accessed by the malicious actor, making it a clear case of a hacker attack.

reservations system from access by that individual and to prevent any further unauthorized charges to guest
payment cards. Passwords to the system were changed. The employee was promptly terminated and the matter
was reported to local law enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (â€œFBIâ€). Although the Hotel
believes that its actions have prevented further potential misuse of its reservations information, out of an
abundance of caution, the Hotel is now notifying all potentially affected individuals so that they may take
measures to protect themselves from any possible future misuse of the information. & What Information Was Involved

Choice recently learned of a technical issue that only occurred in a specific circumstance. The cause of
the issue has been addressed. The issue involved information entered by a visitor to Choice's website
being inadvertently accessible to third parties, with whom Choice has a business relationship, when the
visitor's web browser crashed while on the site. Choice uses technology to track activities that occur on
its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to Choice.
For visitors to Choice's website who used the Safari web browser, if Safari crashed and restarted, Safari
would put information that had been typed by the visitor on the page into the website address for that
page. Tracking technology reads the website address of pages on Choice's website and sends the data
to third parties. Except in a Safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information
entered by visitors. We believe this occurred because of how the code for Safari was written.
This specific issue occurred approximately 88,000 times from June 201S through November 12, 2019.
Choice identified the guest reservations involved that occurred since April 2016 and has sent emails to
those guests. We believe that this scenario occurred very infrequently from June 2015 - March 2016
(likely less than 25 times), but we do not have information available to identify the specific guests so we
are issuing a press release and posting this notice to notify those guests. & If a visitor to Choice's website was using Safari and on the reservation page, the information that had
been typed in fields on that page that could have been put in the website address when the browser
restarted after a crash may include the name of the person making the reservation, email address, state,
zip code, country code, and the number and expiration date of the payment card used to make the
reservation. We are notifying you because this scenario occurred when you were making a reservation.
If you were making a reservation using a mixture of points and payment, the external verification value
on the card may have also been in the website address.	The breach was due to a technical issue that made it possible for information typed by visitors of Choice's website to be accessible to third parties in the event of a Safari browser crash, with the information possibly including names, email addresses, state, zip codes, country codes, and credit card information with CVV numbers. The cause of the issue has already been addressed and Choice has already sent emails to guests affected by the breach. However, due to lack of information, Choice issued a press release and posted a notice for guests that they could not identify.

In July 2019, Magellan discovered that the email accounts of four Magellan employees were targeted by
an unauthorized third party, most likely using a phishing technique. Only one of those employees
worked on Horizon health plan member data. On July 5, we determined that the email account of that
Magellan employee had experienced unauthorized mailbox authentications and connections on or

protect all the employees' email accounts and ensure no further unauthorized access. Magellan then
undertook a thorough investigation of this incident in order to determine whether the unauthorized
third party accessed any of our employees' emails or the contents thereof.

access, the contents of any emails within the employee's email account. However, we cannot

As you know, Nelnet has been servicing your student loans since August 16, 2013. We are
writing to notify you that an unauthorized acquisition of your personal information occurred on
October 10, 2019. Our records indicate that on, April 17, 2019, a i;.tatement was sent to the

2019. On October 10, 2019, a third party advised Nelnet that they had received and opened the
correspondence intended for you, and they destroyed the document. The address was then
removed from your account.

The statement containing personal information was unintentionally sent to the wrong address, and then mistakenly opened by a third party. Therefore, this breach is categorized as "unintended disclosure not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss".

What happened? On August 29, 2019, we became aware that a Prisma Health team member's login credentials were
compromised. We promptly and extensively investigated and determined that the login credentials provided access
to patient pre-registration and volunteer registration information forms previously completed on Palmetto Health's

accessed by the former employee, the records that were potentially subject to unauthorized access included the following
information: patients' first and last name, Social Security number, date of birth, account number, mailing address and
diagnosis.	Based on the information provided, a former employee of Aegis Medical Group accessed certain patient account information with an intention to sell it to third parties for identity theft or financial fraud. Therefore, this is an insider breach.

We recently concluded an investigation into an error that caused your WSECU account number
to appear on the deed for your home equity loan or home equity line of credit. After these
loans are opened, the deeds are recorded with the county in which the property resides and
then become public records. This means that your account number may be visible to individuals
who access the recorded deed on the county system. You may have more than one impacted
loan, depending on your borrowing history. & Your WSECU account number ending in <<Last Four>> was printed on the deed. This number
does not include the full 12-digit account number associated with any check-writing privileges.
As a result, we believe the risk of fraud from this incident is very low; however, your account
number, in combination with other identifying information, could be used to initiate certain
account access.	The breach was caused by unintended disclosure of sensitive information not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss, as the account number was included on a public record by error.

We recently concluded an investigation into an error that caused your WSECU account number
to appear on the deed for your home equity loan or home equity line of credit. After these
loans are opened, the deeds are recorded with the county in which the property resides and
then become public records. This means that your account number may be visible to individuals
who access the recorded deed on the county system. You may have more than one impacted
loan, depending on your borrowing history. & Your WSECU account number ending in <<Last Four>> was printed on the deed. This number
does not include the full 12-digit account number associated with any check-writing privileges.
As a result, we believe the risk of fraud from this incident is very low; however, your account
number, in combination with other identifying information, could be used to initiate certain
account access.	The breach was an unintended disclosure that did not involve hacking, intentional breach, or physical loss. The error caused the WSECU account number to appear on the publicly accessible recorded deed for the home equity loan or line of credit, and therefore the number may be visible to the individuals who access the recorded deed on the county system.

page. Tracking technology reads the website address of pages on Choiceâ€™s website and sends the data
to third parties. Except in a Safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information

On July 12th, 2019, Magellan discovered that the email account of a Magellan employee had
experienced an unauthorized connection by some unknown third party on June 6th, 2019. Upon
discovery, Magellan's Information Security team immediately took steps to protect the employee's
email account and ensure no further unauthorized access. We undertook an extremely thorough

employee had in their email account were accessed. Thus, while we have no evidence or reason to
believe that the hacker accessed any emails at all, out of an abundance of caution we are notifying you
of this incident because you are one of the individuals whose information was contained in at least one
email within our employee's email account.

activity. As part of our internal investigation, we reviewed a sampling of email contents and determined on July 19, 2019, that
the account may contain personal information. With the assistance of leading computer forensics experts, we learned on
August 30, 2019, that the DIS employeeâ€™s email account was accessed without authorization on July 9, 2019. Unfortunately,
the investigation was not able to determine which emails, if any, were actually accessed or viewed.
Working with these third-party experts, DIS undertook a comprehensive review of the impacted email account to confirm its
earlier findings on the contents of the email account and identify those who may have personal information accessible within
the impacted account. Although, to date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information,
we are notifying you in an abundance of caution because your information was present in the impacted email account at
the time of the incident. & Our investigation confirmed the information present within the impacted email account
at the time of the incident includes your <<ClientDef1(Data Elements)>>.	The information only indicates that an email account was accessed without authorization, but it does not specify the cause of the breach or the nature of the information accessed. Therefore, it is unclear whether it was a phishing attack, an insider breach, or a hacking incident, so the breach is classified as unintended disclosure (DISC).
On November 18, 2019, we learned an unauthorized third party placed malicious computer code on our website
(https://www.glassybaby.com/). Upon learning of the incident, we promptly removed the malicious code and
conducted an investigation. The code was active November 15-18, 2019, and was designed to collect information
typed into the websiteâ€™s check-out page as customers made purchases and deliver that information to the
unauthorized third party.&As a result,
some of your information, including your name, email, address, and credit or debit card information, may have
been obtained by the third party. The incident did not impact your Social Security Number.	The statement indicates that an outside party placed malicious code on the company's website to collect customer information, which is indicative of a hacking breach.

The description shows that credit card information was accessed without the use of hacking, malware or other related means, thus indicating that it is a card fraud incident.
On August 11, 2019, Hartman became aware of a theft occurring at our office on August 11, 2019. The 
thieves triggered our alarm system; however, they did take a computer hard drive. The drive was in temporary use as we 
were scanning paper tax source documents (w-2, 1099s etc.) used to prepare tax returns onto the drive, to then be uploaded 
to our secure, encrypted server. Although the investigation is ongoing, we have determined the hard drive contained some 
of your old tax source documents which may contain your personal data. We have no definitive evidence that any of your 
information was accessed or misused, but because your information was present on the hard drive, we are notifying you out 
of an abundance of caution. Hartman is fully cooperating with law enforcement as their investigation continues.
	The paper tax source documents were lost via theft, thus this breach falls under the PHYS category. A computer hard drive was stolen that contained scanned copies of these documents for tax returns.

the new hire orientation process for benefits. Due to a technical issue with our normally used method a document was
sent to all ten employees that contained personally identifiable information for each of the ten employees. Some of your
personal information may have been potentially exposed to others as a result of this. This was not a normal part of our
process and was not intended to occur. Some of your personal information that may have been exposed includes, but is
not limited to: full name, address, phone number, email address and social security number. We do not have any
evidence that your information has been misused. & full name, address, phone number, email address and social security number	The information was inadvertently disclosed through an insecure email correspondence, and it wasn't the result of hacking, theft, or an intentional breach.

unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, dln, financial account info, clinical treatment info & On August 13, 2019, our ongoing investigation into an email incident determined that an unauthorized person had obtained 
access to an email account belonging to a TDC employee for an unknown period of time. Upon first learning of the incident 
on August 9, 2019, we secured the employeeâ€™s email account, launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope 
of the incident, and engaged a computer security firm to assist. Due to the nature of the unauthorized access to the account, 
we were unable to determine which specific emails or attachments, if any, may have been viewed by the unauthorized 
individual.& We, therefore, conducted a comprehensive review of the emails and attachments in the account and determined 
on September 30, 2019 that an email or an attachment contained your <<ClientDef1(Data Impacted)>>.	The breach involved unauthorized access by an outside party to an employee's email account for an unknown period of time, resulting in the acquisition of sensitive personal data such as name, social security number, driver's license number, financial account information, and clinical treatment information, and the inability to determine which specific emails or attachments may have been viewed.

The breach was caused by phishing and an outside party infiltrating the organization's system to obtain sensitive information such as tax ID number, Social Security number, bank account information, name, address, phone number, and/or email.
In October of this year we identified and eliminated a malicious script on the checkout page of our website. The script was
added to our website by an unauthorized third party, and went undetected despite our use of industry-standard malware
scanning and anti-virus technology. We began investigating this incident immediately after suspecting a problem, and
worked diligently to resolve it. We were able to locate and eliminate the unauthorized script and have fully restored our
systems. & We suspect that the malicious script may have been present on our website between January 16, 2019 and October 2, 2019,
and may have compromised the data captured on the checkout page of our website, including names, addresses, email
addresses, CoffeeAM account passwords, and payment card information, including the payment card numbers, expiration
dates, and card verification numbers of persons who placed orders on our site within this date range.	The unauthorized third-party adding a malicious script on the checkout page of the website suggests that this was a hack.

On or about May 8, 2019, we detected that the email account of an email administrator was accessed by
an unauthorized person. We immediately engaged leading data security firms to conduct a thorough
investigation, and we believe the unauthorized activity is attributable to phishing emails received in April
and May 2019. Our investigation concluded that the incident implicated no systems beyond certain of the
Company's email accounts and that the unauthorized person did not gain access to any account
management or online customer database or server or other INTL FCStone systems.
As noted above, we were unable to determine whether any information about you was actually accessed ,
but we have also not been able to rule out that your information was affected by this incident. Information
that might have been implicated includes your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's
license number, passport number, INTL FCStone account number, and other information we collect or use
in the ordinary course of our business. & name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, INTL FCStone account number	The breach was caused by unauthorized access to an email account that was compromised after a phishing email in April and May of 2019.
phishing; name, address, dob, ssn, dln, passport number & On May 8, 2019, INTL FCStone detected that the email account of an email administrator was accessed by an unauthorized person. We immediately engaged leading data security finns to conduct a thorough investigation, and we believe the unauthorized activity is attributable to phishing emails received in April and May 2019. Working with these consultants, we successfully tenninated the unauthorized person's access to our system on May 14. The consultants concluded that the incident implicated no systems beyond certain of INTL FCStone's email accounts and that the unauthorized person did not gain access to any account management or online customer database or server or other INTL FCStone system. The investigation could not, however, conclusively rule out that information was accessed or removed from the affected email accounts. We thus immediately began working with a leading forensic film to analyze the scope of any implicated info1mation. This review and analysis took a substantial amount of time due to the unstructured nature and combined volume of items in the affected email accounts. Given this, the forensic finn did not provide us their rep01i until late October, at which point we i1mnediately began our analysis of the forensic firm's findings, which included supplementing their analysis with residency information. We completed this analysis on December 6th, 2019. While, as noted above, we are unable to conclusively detennine whether any infonnation about the potentially implicated individuals was actually accessed or removed from the affected email accounts, we nonetheless decided, out of an abundance of caution, that it was approp1iate to notify them that their personal information may have been implicated by the incident. This personal infonnation may have included an individual's name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, INTL FCStone account number, and other infonnation we collect or use in the ordinary course of our business. At this time, all indications are that the unauthorized person has no fu1iher access to our email system. As always, we've been working with leading experts to enhance our security. We continue to monitor our systems for unauthorized access and have introduced additional security measures since the incident including, among other things, implementing multi-factor authentication for our email system. We have also coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the incident.& an individual's name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, INTL FCStone account number, and other infonnation	The breach involved unauthorized access of an email account due to phishing emails, and potentially exposed personal information including an individual's name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, INTL FCStone account number, and other information. The investigation could not conclusively determine if information was accessed or removed from the affected email accounts.
We recently learned that the email account of a single NHC employee was compromised by an
outside attacker at times between September 11, 2019 and September 18, 2019. We retained legal counsel
and a computer forensics firm to investigate this matter. As a result of that investigation, we located no
evidence that your information was extracted from our systems or misused in any way. Certain emails
within that email account contain sensitive or personal identifying information, but we cannot confirm
with certainly which emails within that email account were accessed or reviewed by the outside attacker,
if any. We are therefore providing notice to you of this attack out of an abundance of caution.& name, financial account number, date of birth, Social Security number, address, driverâ€™s license number,

It has come to our attention that, on rare occasions, users of ShopRunner Express Checkout who were adding new payment card information and experienced some error (e.g., loss of internet connection) may have had their credit or debit card information appended to and transferred to the relevant retailer in URL logs. When this did occur, the information in the URLs was transmitted with encryption, which means it was not accessible to any third parties. However, our retail partners in some cases captured plain text URls of that information, which was then available in turn to their website vendors, such as ad technology and analytics companies.

& The information that could have been accessed as a result of that transmission consisted solely of your name, address, and credit or debit card information (number, expiration date and possibly CVV code, which is the three or four-digit number typically printed on the back of your card). We are not aware of and have no reason to believe there to have been improper use of any of this information.	The breach was an unintended disclosure of credit or debit card information that was captured in plain text URLs and inadvertently transmitted to website vendors of ShopRunner Corporation's retail partners. The breach did not involve hacking or physical loss of data, and there is no evidence of any improper use of the information.
WCW is a third-party service provider of learning management system products and services to AANA. AANA 
has the relationship to the individuals potentially affected by this incident. To our knowledge, an unauthorized 
individual â€” not associated with WCW or AANA â€” modified a piece of computer code used on a WCW-hosted 
website that services AANA customers. This modified computer code was designed to capture payment card data 
and limited other information entered on certain pages on the website. The modified code was active on the website

loss of internet connection) may have had their credit or debit card information appended to and
transferred to the relevant retailer in URL logs. When this did occur, the information in the URLs was
transmitted with encryption, which means it was not accessible to any third parties. However, in some
cases, ShopRunner's retail partners captured plain text URLs of that information, which was then
available in turn to their website vendors, such as ad technology and analytics companies.	The breach involved a software error that resulted in the accidental transfer of users' payment card information to the relevant retailer in URL logs during the checkout process. Although the information was transmitted with encryption, in some cases, the plain text URLs of the information were captured by the retailer's website vendors, such as ad technology and analytics companies.

page of SmokingPipes.com. We immediately removed the malicious code and launched an investigation to 
determine how it was placed on the checkout page and what information may have been affected as a result. 
Our investigation determined that the malicious code gathered certain payment card information as it was 
manually entered on the checkout page and sent that information to an external site where it could be 
retrieved by the bad actor. This incident impacted only those customers who entered their payment card 
information manually on our checkout page, and did not affect customers who used saved card information.
& The investigation determined that the malicious code may have captured 
your name, payment card number, expiration date, and security code or CVV number	The presence of a malicious code suggests that an outside party may have gained unauthorized access to SmokingPipes.com's checkout page and intercepted payment card information.
unauthorized access to email account; names, Social Security numbers, medical or health information, and health insurance information. & On June 17, 2019, Millennium discovered unusual activity in its email system. Millennium
immediately took measures to secure its system and launched an investigation with the assistance
of a digital forensics firm to help determine what occurred and whether personal information was
accessed or acquired without authorization as a result. The forensics investigation thereafter
determined that one Millennium employee email account was accessed without authorization
between June 14, 2019 and June 17, 2019. Upon learning this information, Millennium launched a
data review project to analyze the impacted mailbox and determine whether that account contained
personal information, which subsequently identified individuals whose personal information may
have been impacted. Millennium then worked diligently to identify up-to-date address information
required to notify potentially impacted individuals. On December 15, 2019, Millennium confirmed
that the personal information of the above-referenced Maryland residents was contained in the
impacted mailbox and therefore may have been accessed without authorization. & The incident may have involved unauthorized access
to Maryland residentsâ€™ names, Social Security numbers, medical or health information, and health
insurance information.	There was unauthorized access to an employee email account which contained personal information such as names, Social Security numbers, medical or health information, and health insurance information. A digital forensics firm was involved in the investigation and it was determined that the email account was accessed without authorization.
On June 17, 2019, we detected unusual activity in a Millennium employee email account. We 
immediately took steps to secure the account and launched an investigation. In connection therewith, we engaged a 
leading, independent forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information was accessed or 
acquired without authorization. On September 4, 2019, our investigation determined that the impacted Millennium email 
account contained some of your personal information which may have been accessed by the unauthorized individual.

unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, tax ID number, claim info & On July 5, 2019, our Information Security team discovered that the Microsoft Office 365 email account of a Magellan employee had been sending out large volumes of spam email. An investigation revealed that several unauthorized mailbox authentications and connections originating from outside the country had been occurring on this employeeâ€™s email account since May 28, 2019. It is believed that the hacker(s) were able to obtain the employeeâ€™s email log-in credentials through a phishing attack or other fraudulent means.

On July 12, 2019, Magellan discovered that another email account of a Magellan employee had experienced an unauthorized connection by some unknown third party on June 6, 2019. Upon discovery, Magellanâ€™s Information Security team immediately took steps to protect the employeeâ€™s email account and ensure no further unauthorized access. The employee whose email account was impacted interacted with health care providers serving Presbyterian Health Plan (â€œPHPâ€) members in New Mexico to resolve issues with claims for their patients, so the emails which may have potentially been accessed involved claims data including both member and provider information.
& (Note that 1 of the providers serving PHP members was impacted as their Social Security Number (â€œSSNâ€) was potentially exposed, and the other 2 providersâ€™ Tax Identification Numbers (â€œTINâ€) were potentially exposed (1 provider serving PHP members and 1 serving other health plans).)	The breach was a result of unauthorized access to an employee's email account that had been occurring since May 28, 2019, likely due to a phishing attack or other fraudulent means. There were several unauthorized mailbox authentications and connections originating from outside the country which resulted in the compromise of personal information such as name, SSN, tax ID number, and claim info.
unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, tax ID number, claim info	The unauthorized access to the email account suggests that an outsider gained access through hacking.
unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, tax ID number, claim info & On July 12th, 2019, Magellan discovered that the email account of a Magellan employee had
experienced an unauthorized connection by some unknown third party on June 6th, 2019. Upon
discovery, Magellanâ€™s Information Security team immediately took steps to protect the employeeâ€™s
email account and ensure no further unauthorized access. We undertook an extremely thorough
investigation of this incident in order to determine whether the unauthorized third party may have
actually accessed any of our employeeâ€™s emails. It is our belief that the unauthorized third party was
attempting to gain access to email accounts solely to send out large volumes of spam, and had no
intention to view or otherwise access the contents of any emails within the employeeâ€™s email account at
all. However, despite our best efforts, we are unable to definitively say that none of the emails that our
employee had in their email account were accessed. Thus, while we have no evidence or reason to
believe that the hacker accessed any emails at all, out of an abundance of caution we are notifying you
of this incident because you are one of the individuals whose information was contained in at least one
email within our employeeâ€™s email account. & The employee whose email account was impacted interacted with providers to help resolve issues with
claims for their patients who were PHP plan members, so the emails which may have potentially been
accessed involved claims data including both member and provider information. Since you use your
Social Security Number (â€œSSNâ€) as your Taxpayer Identification Number (â€œTINâ€), unfortunately your SSN
was included in the claims data.	An unauthorized third party gained access to an employee's email account on June 6th, 2019. Although it is believed that the hacker was attempting to send spam and did not access any emails, it cannot be definitively confirmed that no emails were accessed. The breach involved PHI and PII, including name, SSN, tax ID number, and claim information.

Upon learning of the incident, we immediately took steps to secure the email account, launched an investigation, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist. Findings from our investigation indicate that an unauthorized individual gained access to an employeeâ€™s email account at various times between March 21, 2019 and July 31, 2019. The investigation was not able to determine which emails and attachments were accessed or acquired by the unauthorized person & name, address, Social Security number, driverâ€™s license number, passport, and other information submitted in connection with an application for housing or employment with Preservation Management, Inc	The breach involved unauthorized access to an email account by an outside party over a significant period of time, indicating that there was likely an intentional hacking or phishing attack. The investigation was not able to determine which emails and attachments were accessed or acquired by the unauthorized person.
On December 2, 2019, Rooster Teeth discovered that malicious code had been added to the Site 
earlier the same day. The malicious code directed users entering a checkout on the Site to a 
spoofed webpage where they were asked to enter payment card details in order to complete their 
purchases. This was inserted after the stage at which users entered their shipping data. Users 
who completed the payment card details page were then directed to the real webpage, where they 
were asked to complete the forms again. & If you entered information on the spoofed webpage described above, your name, email address, 
telephone number, physical address, and/or payment card information (including expiration dates 
and security codes) may have been exposed. You are receiving this notice because our records 
show that you visited the affected checkout process on our Site on the day of the incident and 
may have been affected by this incident.	The malicious code inserted into the Rooster Teeth Productions Limited Liability Company website on December 2, 2019, directed users to a spoofed webpage where payment card details were requested, exposing payment card information including expiration dates and security codes, therefore this is classified as a card breach.
The forensic evidence suggests that TripleTree Holdings was the target of this incident and the bad actor was seeking 
to defraud the firm by attempting to access emails that would facilitate financial fraud. We have no reason to believe 
that the attacker was looking for personal information and we do not know if any information was ever actually 
viewed or acquired by the attacker. 
& Nevertheless, because the bad actor had temporary access to the email accounts, 
we searched for any personal information in the email accounts that could have been viewed. On December 1, 2019, 
we determined that one of the email accounts contained your Social Security number.	There is not enough information to definitively categorize this breach. While the attacker was attempting to access emails to facilitate financial fraud, it is unclear if any personal or sensitive information was actually acquired or viewed. Additionally, there is no clear indication of how the attacker gained access, whether it was through hacking, a physical breach, or an insider.

devices used to process payment cards, our restaurants and food and beverage outlets also have order-entry systems
with a card reader attached for waitstaff to enter kitchen and bar orders and to swipe Landry's Select Club reward
cards. In rare circumstances, it appears waitstaff may have mistakenly swiped payment cards on the order-entry
systems. The payment cards potentially involved in this incident are the cards mistakenly swiped on the order-entry

The malware searched for track data (which sometimes has the cardholder name in addition to card number, expiration
date, and internal verification code) read from a payment card after it was swiped on the order-entry systems. In some
instances, the malware only identified the part of the magnetic stripe that contained payment card information
without the cardholder name. The general timeframe when data from cards mistakenly swiped on the order-entry
systems may have been accessed is March 13, 2019 to October 17, 2019. At a small number of locations, access may
have occurred as early as January 18, 2019. A full list of Landry's owned restaurants and food and beverage outlets
involved is available here.	Landry's Corporation experienced unauthorized access to their payment processing systems for restaurants and food and beverage outlets due to operation of malware designed to access payment card data from cards used in person on systems at the restaurants and food and beverage outlets.
What Happened?
Landry's recently detected unauthorized access to the network that supports our payment processing systems for
restaurants and food and beverage outlets. We immediately launched an investigation, and a leading cybersecurity firm
was engaged to assist. Although the investigation identified the operation of malware designed to access payment card
data from cards used in person on systems at our restaurants and food and beverage outlets, the end-to-end encryption
technology on point-of-sale terminals, which makes card data unreadable, was working as designed and prevented the
malware from accessing payment card data when cards were used on these encryption devices. Besides the encryption
devices used to process payment cards, our restaurants and food and beverage outlets also have order-entry systems
with a card reader attached for waitstaff to enter kitchen and bar orders and to swipe Landry's Select Club reward
cards. In rare circumstances, it appears waitstaff may have mistakenly swiped payment cards on the order-entry

involved is available here.	Unauthorized access to the network that supports payment processing systems for restaurants and food and beverage outlets resulted in the operation of malware designed to access payment card data. It is unclear if the breach was caused by an insider.
On November 22, 2019, Landryâ€™s first became aware of rare instances of unencrypted
payment card data that may have been accessed by the malware. Landryâ€™s then worked diligently
to determine how the unencrypted card data may have entered the environment, the scope of the
issue, and sought assistance from its payment processor and encryption-to-end encryption
technology provider. The investigation determined that in rare circumstances, it appears waitstaff
may have mistakenly swiped payment cards on the order-entry systems. The payment cards
potentially involved in this incident are the cards mistakenly swiped on the order-entry systems.

The malware involved looked for track data containing the cardholder's name, card number, expiration date, and internal verification code. The breach did not involve hacking, insider access, physical theft or loss, or disclosure, but instead centered around unauthorized access of payment card information.

If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, dob, dln & ElecTel recently discovered that someone remotely accessed the email account of one of its
employees without authorization. Upon learning of the incident, it promptly contained the
incident by securing the email account to prevent further access. The incident was limited to one
email account, which operates outside of and separate from ElecTel's core bank system and
internal network, which were not affected.
At this point, ElecTel is not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a result of
this incident, and does not know if any personal information was ever actually viewed or
acquired by the unauthorized party. Nevertheless, as part of its investigation and out of an
abundance of caution, it searched for any personal information in the email account that could
have been viewed, and on November 20, 2019, it determined that the account contained the
personal information of some members. ElecTel has been working to locate current addresses & personal information	Based on the information provided, the breach resulted from unauthorized access to an email account and does not appear to involve hacking, physical loss, theft or portable devices. Additionally, the breach is not confirmed to have resulted in any fraud or identity theft.

learning <if the issue, \Ve launched an investigation and removed the unauthorized code. A leading cybersecurity firm 
was also engaged to assist. & During the customer checkout process, this unauthorized code could
have potentially captured information including: names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment card
number, expiration date, and card verification code.	The presence of an unauthorized code suggests that the outside party installed malware onto the website without authorization, making this a hacking incident. The potential capture of payment card information also suggests that this was likely a criminal act involving stolen credit card data, rather than unintentional or accidental disclosures.
Landry's recently detected unauthorized access to the network that supports our payment processing systems for
restaurants and food and beverage outlets. We immediately launched an investigation, and a leading cybersecurity firm
was engaged to assist. Although the investigation identified the operation of malware designed to access payment card
data from cards used in person on systems at our restaurants and food and beverage outlets, the end-to-end encryption
technology on point-of-sale terminals, which makes card data unreadable, was working as designed and prevented the
malware from accessing payment card data when cards were used on these encryption devices & The malware searched for track data (which sometimes has the cardholder name in addition to card number, expiration
date, and internal verification code) read from a payment card after it was swiped on the order-entry systems.	Based on the information provided, there was unauthorized access to the payment processing system that supports the organization's restaurants and food outlets. The investigation revealed that malware was used to access payment card data from cards used in person on systems at their outlets.

States Logistics became aware of unusual activity within an employeeâ€™s email account. We
immediately began an investigation with the assistance of a third-party forensic investigator and reset relevant employee
passwords. The investigation determined that an unauthorized actor accessed one employee email account for a period
of approximately one hour on August 30, 2019. The investigation was unable to determine which, if any, emails and
attachments within the email account were accessed or viewed. Therefore, we undertook a time-consuming review
of the email account to determine whether it contained any sensitive information. On December 2, 2019, our review
determined that some of your personal information was present in the email at the time of the incident. & The information related to you found within the email account includes your <<b2b_

this information as a result of this incident.	The unauthorized access to the employee's email account was due to an outside actor, therefore classifying it as a hacked incident.
What Happened? Vivo recently learned of unusual activity related to an employee email account. Upon learning of the
suspicious activity, we immediately took steps to secure the email account and began working with a computer forensic
investigation firm to determine the nature and scope of the incident. The investigation confirmed that the Vivo employee
email account was accessed by an unknown actor from July 16, 2019 to August 6, 2019.
The investigation was unable to determine with forensic certainty what emails, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized
actor. In an abundance of caution, we worked with experts to perform a comprehensive review of all information stored in
the email account at the time of unauthorized access to confirm the identities of the individuals whose information may
have been accessible to the unauthorized actor. We then conducted a manual review of our records to determine the identities
and contact information for potentially impacted individuals.& What Information Was Involved? On or about December 11, 2019, we determined the following types of information
relating to you were present in the email account, which may have been accessible to the unknown actor during this incident:

RE: AmeriSave Mortgage Corporation Notification of Security Breach under Md. Code Ann., Com. Law 14-3504(h).

Dear Attorney General Frosh:

On behalf of AmeriSave Mortgage Corporation (AmeriSave), I write to advise of a cybersecurity incident affecting one of AmeriSaves accounts with a business partner.

Incident Summary. On November 1, 2019, one of AmeriSaves business partners informed AmeriSave of suspicious IP addresses accessing the business partners platform using AmeriSaves access credentials. Immediately upon learning about this issue from the business partner, AmeriSave requested the list of suspicious IP addresses. Upon review, AmeriSave determined that two of the IP addresses did not belong to AmeriSave or its employees, and the business partner promptly disabled access to the relevant account on November 4, 2019. At that time, it was unknown whether any consumer information had been compromised; as a result, AmeriSave immediately coordinated with the business partner to research this incident further. After conducting further research, on December 12, 2019, the business partner informed AmeriSave that certain AmeriSave consumer data may have been accessed from the suspicious IP addresses.

Based on the information above, AmeriSave believes it is likely that an unauthorized third party may have gained access to customer loan records, stored on the business partners platform, which may have contained Personal Information (as that term is defined under Maryland law). The records may have included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, employment history, income information, mortgage loan information, information regarding assets and liabilities, and other consumer information; however, no passwords, security codes, access codes, or similar information were present in the potentially compromised data. Based on a preliminary analysis of the business partner-provided activity logs, AmeriSave believes that the Personal Information including up to 70 Maryland residents may have been improperly accessed. Both the business partner and AmeriSave are continuing to investigate the cause of the unauthorized access and potential compromise of AmeriSaves account credentials.

AmeriSave has engaged Buckley LLP as external legal counsel and Ankura as an incident response vendor to assist in resolving this issue and investigating the cause. AmeriSave is in the process of preparing notifications to affected consumers regarding this incident out of abundance of caution. Though the investigation still is ongoing, AmeriSave is currently unaware of any misuse of the Personal Information of any Maryland resident. However, if AmeriSave identifies any additional Maryland residents whose Personal Information may have been accessed, we will so advise.

Communicating with Affected Individuals. In compliance with Maryland law, AmeriSave will send written notice by letter without unreasonable delay, which AmeriSaves estimates will be in early January 2020, to all currently identified customers whose personal information may have been accessible. A draft copy of the consumer notification is attached to this letter as Exhibit A, which we may amend as we confirm the scope of the incident. The letter, among other things, advises the affected individuals to remain vigilant by reviewing their account statements. As AmeriSave completes its investigation, if it identifies any additional customers whose personal information may have been accessible, it will send written notification to them as well.

Additional Steps to Protect Consumers and Enhance Protections. On November 4, 2019, the business partner disabled AmeriSaves compromised account. AmeriSave is taking steps designed to prevent a similar incident from happening again, including resetting or changing of passwords of administrator accounts on an aggressive, periodic basis. AmeriSave is planning to offer 12 months of identity monitoring services to all Maryland	The breach was caused by unauthorized access by a third party to AmeriSave's account with a business partner, potentially compromising customer loan records and personal information including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, employment history, income information, mortgage loan information, information regarding assets and liabilities, and other consumer information of up to 70 Maryland residents.
Breach type: unauthorized access to email account | Incident Details: name ssn dob dln | | Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Unable to extract PDF text or No PDF Available.	The description of the breach mentions "unauthorized access to email account", indicating that an outside party or malware was involved in gaining access to sensitive information (name, SSN, DOB, and DLN). The lack of a PDF or inability to extract text suggests that the breach was not a physical or unintentional disclosure, and there is no indication of involvement by an insider or portable device.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you of an incident that involves portions of your information. Alomere Health understands the importance of protecting our patients' information.

On November 6, 2019, we learned that an unauthorized person(s) gained access to an Alomere Health employee's email account between October 31, 2019, and November 1, 2019. We immediately secured the account and began an investigation with a leading computer forensic firm hired to assist us. During the investigation, on November 10, 2019, we discovered unauthorized access to a second employee email account occurring on November 6, 2019. The investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized person(s) actually viewed any email or attachment in either account.

In an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments in the accounts to identify patients whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized person(s). From this review, we determined that portions of your information were contained in the email accounts. This information may have included your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, medical record number, health insurance information, treatment information, and/or diagnosis information.

While we have no confirmation that your information was actually viewed by the unauthorized person(s), or that it has been misused, we felt compelled to notify you of this incident and assure you that we take this very seriously.

As an act of goodwill, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership of Experian IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorks is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score.

We also recommend that you review any statements that you receive from your healthcare providers or health insurer. If you see a service or services that you did not receive, please contact the provider or insurer immediately.

We regret this unauthorized action occurred and that it may cause inconvenience for you. To lessen the likelihood this occurs in the future, we have put in place additional security measures for all of Alomere Health employee email accounts. It is through these additional layers of security, staff training, and diligence that Alomere Health will continue to provide high-quality healthcare to you close to home with safety and security.

Free Credit Reports:

In addition, you have the right to request that each of the three consumer reporting agencies listed below send you a free copy of your credit reports once every twelve months for your review. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's website at www.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. Do not contact the three credit bureaus individually; they provide your free report only through the website or toll-free number. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Thieves may wait to use stolen personal information at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find accounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate, or inaccurate personal information (such as your home address or Social Security number), please call the consumer reporting agency at the telephone number on the report.

Fraud Alerts:

In addition to reviewing your credit report, you have the right to place a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert requires creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. To place a fraud alert on your credit file, please call any one of the three major credit bureaus listed below. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. The initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for 90 days. You can renew it after 90 days.

That makes it less likely that an identify thief can open new accounts in your name. Please be mindful that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. To place a credit freeze on your credit file, please call any one of the three major credit bureaus listed above or use the webpages listed below:

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<Name 1>> :

Vivo Capital, LLC (Vivo) is writing to inform you of a recent event that may impact the security of some of your personal information and to assure you that we have taken additional steps to safeguard against future incidents. While we are unaware of any attempted or actual misuse of your information, we are providing you with information about the event, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is necessary to do so.

What Happened?

Vivo recently learned of unusual activity related to an employee email account. Upon learning of the suspicious activity, we immediately took steps to secure the email account and began working with a computer forensic investigation firm to determine the nature and scope of the incident. The investigation confirmed that the Vivo employee email account was accessed by an unknown actor from July 16, 2019 to August 6, 2019. The investigation was unable to determine with forensic certainty what emails, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized actor. In an abundance of caution, we worked with experts to perform a comprehensive review of all information stored in the email account at the time of unauthorized access to confirm the identities of the individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized actor. We then conducted a manual review of our records to determine the identities and contact information for potentially impacted individuals.

What Information Was Involved?

On or about December 11, 2019, we determined the following types of information relating to you were present in the email account, which may have been accessible to the unknown actor during this incident: <<variable text>>. There is no evidence this information was misused by the unknown actor and Vivo is providing this notice in an abundance of caution.

What We Are Doing.

We take this incident and the security of your personal information very seriously. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately took steps to secure the affected email account. As part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy of personal information in our care, we have been working to review our existing policies and procedures and to implement enhanced security measures, including migrating our email system to Office 365 with multi-factor authentication. We also notified state regulators, as required. While we are unaware of any misuse of your information as a result of this incident, we are offering you access to 12 months of complimentary credit monitoring and identity restoration services through TransUnion.

What You Can Do.

You can find out more about how to protect against potential identity theft and fraud in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information. We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. You may also enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services described above. Enrollment instructions are attached to this letter.

For More Information.

If you have additional questions, please call our dedicated assistance line at 833-991-1561, Monday through Friday (excluding U.S. holidays), during the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Pacific Time. You may also write to the Vivo Capital at 192 Lytton Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94301.

We sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause.

Sincerely,

Zhanping Wu
General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer

Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Re: Notice of data security breach

Dear All,

We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. For this reason, we are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have allowed an unauthorized person to access some of your personal information.

What happened?

On [date], we were informed by three contractors about irregularities regarding their payroll processed on [date]. We immediately notified our online payroll service provider, Netchex, which conducted an investigation. We use an administrative account to process payroll, and we access the account using an administrator username and password. Netchex's investigation found that between November 3, 2019, and December 20, 2019, an unauthorized person accessed our administrative account by logging in with the valid username and password credentials.

What information was involved?

Our administrative account has access to all demographic information stored with Netchex, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, bank routing numbers, and other sensitive personal information. While we do not have evidence that the intruder actually accessed or acquired such information, it would have been possible.

What we are doing.

We immediately notified Netchex, and their information security team swiftly launched an investigation into this matter. Netchex helped us reset our administrative password and configure security features to help guard against this type of unauthorized access from happening again. At this time, we are not aware of any unauthorized access to our network or underlying systems or misuse of the potentially compromised information.

What you can do.

Please regularly change your Netchex account password, and do not share it with others. You should also remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitor your credit report for unauthorized activity. You may also consider placing a fraud alert or credit freeze with each of the three credit bureaus, which may be contacted here:

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Sharma Wasson & Associates, Inc. (SWA), to notify you of a security incident involving one Maryland resident. SWA is a business consulting firm hired by organizations to provide tax and accounting services.

SWA recently learned of a security incident when tax returns it attempted to file on behalf of a small number of clients were rejected as being previously filed. None of those clients are Maryland residents.

Upon first learning of the incident, SWA took steps to investigate the potential incident and a computer security firm was engaged to assist. In the course of the investigation, SWA	Based on the information provided, it seems that there was unauthorized access to an email account of Sharma Wasson & Associates Inc., which resulted in the exposure of at least one Maryland resident's personal information, including their name and social security number. The data breach does not appear to involve hacking or physical theft, but rather a disclosure resulting from unauthorized access to an email account.

Treloar & Heisel (â€œTreloarâ€) recently discovered an incident that may affect the security of your personal information. We write to provide you with information about the incident, steps we are taking in response, and steps you can take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is appropriate to do so. We take this incident seriously and are providing you with information and access to resources so that you can protect your personal information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.
What Happened? In May, 2019, a Treloar employeeâ€™s laptop was stolen from their car. Treloar immediately began an investigation to confirm the security of the laptop and to determine the nature and scope of the event. Further, Treloar immediately took steps to secure the information accessible on the laptop, including changing the employeeâ€™s password to email and other cloud-based storage systems. & What Information Was Involved? The laptop was primarily used to access cloud-based storage and email. While Treloar has no evidence of any unauthorized access to the Treloar employeeâ€™s email account and other documents that may have been accessed by the employee from the laptop, we cannot completely rule out that a limited set of data may have been stored locally. In an abundance of caution, Treloar reviewed those materials that might have been saved locally to identify any potential personal information that may have been accessible on the laptop. Treloar has no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information, and is providing notice out of an abundance of caution. On or about October 29, 2019, after a thorough review process, Treloar determined that your information was potentially accessible to an unauthorized actor. Treloar determined the following information related to you may have been viewed without authorization: Exposed Element 1, Exposed Element 2, Exposed Element 3, Exposed Element 4 and Exposed Element 5.	The breach involved the theft of a Treloar employee's laptop from their car, leading to potential access to personal information stored locally on the laptop, as well as cloud-based storage and email.

We at Bristol Industries and its subsidiaries understand the importance of protecting the personal information in our possession. We are writing to inform you of a security incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken and some steps you can take in response.

Our ongoing investigation into an email phishing incident recently determined that an unauthorized party could have accessed emails with potentially sensitive information in a limited number of Bristol employee email accounts. Upon learning of the potential access, we took steps to secure the email accounts and began an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized party accessed the accounts between March 23, 2019, and September 26, 2019. The investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized person. Out of an abundance of caution, we conducted a comprehensive search for and review of the emails and attachments in the accounts and determined on December 16, 2019, that an email or attachment contained your <<b2b_text_1(Impacted Data)>>.

Although, to date, we have no evidence that your information has been misused, we assure you that we take this incident very seriously. We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity. For some additional steps you can take to help protect yourself, please see the additional information provided with this letter.

We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused by this incident. We have implemented additional safeguards and technical security measures to further protect personal information, including implementing multifactor authentication on employee email accounts. If you have any questions, please call 1-844-987-1201, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central Time.

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

If you are a resident of Maryland or North Carolina, you may contact and obtain information from your state attorney general at:

Maryland Attorney General's Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-743-0023 / 1-410-576-6300, www.oag.state.md.us

Bristol Industries, LLC can be contacted by mail at 5015 Business Park Blvd., Suite 4000, Anchorage, AK 99503.

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one (1) year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies.

Credit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.

There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com

Other Important Information

Security Freeze

In some US states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. A security freeze (also known as a credit freeze) makes it harder for someone to open a new account in your name. It is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to apply for a new credit card, wireless phone, or any service that requires a credit check. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. To place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement. There is no charge to request a security freeze or to remove a security freeze.	This appears to be an unintended disclosure of personal information to the wrong recipient via email.
Breach type: phishing | Incident Details: name payment card info | | Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We at Bristol Industries and its subsidiaries understand the importance of protecting the personal information in our possession. We are writing to inform you of a security incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken and some steps you can take in response.

Our ongoing investigation into an email phishing incident recently determined that an unauthorized party could have accessed emails with potentially sensitive information in a limited number of Bristol employee email accounts. Upon learning of the potential access, we took steps to secure the email accounts and began an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized party accessed the accounts between March 23, 2019, and September 26, 2019. The investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized person. Out of an abundance of caution, we conducted a comprehensive search for and review of the emails and attachments in the accounts and determined on December 16, 2019, that an email or attachment contained your <<b2b_text_1(Impacted Data)>>.

Although, to date, we have no evidence that your information has been misused, we assure you that we take this incident very seriously. We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity. For some additional steps you can take to help protect yourself, please see the additional information provided with this letter.

We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused by this incident. We have implemented additional safeguards and technical security measures to further protect personal information, including implementing multifactor authentication on employee email accounts. If you have any questions, please call 1-844-987-1201, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central Time.

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Maryland Attorney General's Office, 200 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, MD 21202, 1-888-743-0023 / 1-410-576-6300, www.oag.state.md.us

Bristol Industries, LLC can be contacted by mail at 5015 Business Park Blvd., Suite 4000, Anchorage, AK 99503.

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one (1) year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies.

Credit Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.

There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com

They are providing information about the incident, steps they are taking in response, and steps you can take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud. In May 2019, a Treloar employee's laptop was stolen from their car. Treloar immediately began an investigation to confirm the security of the laptop and to determine the nature and scope of the event. Further, Treloar immediately took steps to secure the information accessible on the laptop, including changing the employee's password to email and other cloud-based storage systems. The laptop was primarily used to access cloud-based storage and email. While Treloar has no evidence of any unauthorized access to the Treloar employee's email account and other documents that may have been accessed by the employee from the laptop, they cannot completely rule out that a limited set of data may have been stored locally. In an abundance of caution, Treloar reviewed those materials that might have been saved locally to identify any potential personal information that may have been accessible on the laptop. Treloar has no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information, and is providing notice out of an abundance of caution. On or about October 29, 2019, after a thorough review process, Treloar determined that your information was potentially accessible to an unauthorized actor. Treloar identified and mitigated the issue by changing the employee's passwords immediately after the laptop was stolen to prevent any access to email or cloud storage by an unauthorized actor. They are also taking additional actions to enhance the security policies and procedures utilized by their employees regarding storage of data and laptop usage. They encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity.

We regret to inform you that we are currently investigating an incident that may have involved some of your information.

On October 25, 2019, HQ discovered that some of your information may have been contained in employee email accounts that were accessed by an unauthorized party during a phishing email incident. HQ first became aware of a potential incident in July 2018 when several HQ employees were deceived by a phishing scheme, which resulted in certain HQ employees inadvertently disclosing their email account credentials to an unauthorized party. Upon learning of the incident, the employee email accounts in question were secured, and a leading cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist us in investigating the matter. As part of the investigation, HQ conducted a comprehensive review of the contents of the email accounts in question to determine if they contained any sensitive information. Through this review, which was completed on November 8, 2019, HQ determined that the information contained in the accounts may have included your name, Social Security number, driver's license issuing state and number, passport number, financial account information, health insurance information, and clinical information related to care you received at HQ or one of our affiliates.

To date, we have no evidence that any of your information has been misused or accessed. However, out of an abundance of caution, we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements for any unauthorized activity. As a precaution, we have arranged for you to receive a complimentary one-year membership to Experian's IdentityWorksSM credit monitoring service.

Date: [Insert Date of notice]

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear [Insert Email Address],

We are writing to inform you about a data breach that occurred on the website www.ToonDoo.com (ToonDoo).

The password used for your ToonDoo account has been compromised. If you have used the same password for other accounts, we strongly recommend that you change your password in those accounts as well.

What Happened?

On November 11, 2019, we discovered that there was a data breach at ToonDoo.com. We immediately shut down the ToonDoo website.

What Information Was Involved?

ToonDoo users' email addresses, usernames, passwords, and gender were compromised. In a few instances, the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which users signed up for a ToonDoo account and hence such users' geographic location, namely, city and U.S. state or country, as the case may be, were also compromised. ToonDoo did not have any credit card or other financial information, U.S. Social Security numbers, or other highly sensitive personal information.

What We Are Doing

As soon as we discovered that ToonDoo user information had been compromised, JAMBAV, Inc. immediately shut down the website. An independent forensics company will investigate the nature and extent of the breach.

We have filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), are otherwise engaging with law enforcement authorities, and will cooperate and assist in any of their investigation activities.

What You Can Do

Even though ToonDoo had no financial information, U.S. social security numbers, and other similarly highly sensitive personal information, we strongly recommend that you be proactive in protecting yourself from possible fraud, identity theft, or other illegal activity using your personal information. You can follow the recommendations in the next section to protect your personal information.

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO FURTHER PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your U.S. state attorney general, and/or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. You can continue to renew your fraud alert. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three U.S. national credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. If you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency, there may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift, or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you, including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, Federal Trade Commission, or from your respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the Federal Trade Commission or to the Attorney General in your state.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam,

We represent the City of Dothan (the City) located at 126 N. Saint Andrews Street, Dothan, AL 36303, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to fourteen (14) Maryland residents that may have been affected by the CentralSquare Technologies (CentralSquare) data security incident. This notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this voluntary notice, the City does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law, the applicability of the Maryland data event notification statute, personal jurisdiction, or sovereign immunity.

Nature of the Data Event

On November 6, 2019, the City received notice from CentralSquare of a potential data security issue within the online payment portal, Click2Gov, which is managed and operated by that vendor. The notice indicated that alterations to Click2Gov's applicable code could have enabled the unauthorized access to certain payment card information from the customer's internet browser window during a payment transaction. On December 4, 2019, CentralSquare confirmed that the time period in which the payment transactions may have been affected is between August 26, 2019, and October 26, 2019.

CentralSquare advised that the unauthorized code was capable of capturing customer information, such as name, address, credit/debit card number, card type, printed security code, and expiration date.

Notice to Maryland Residents

CentralSquare is assisting affected entities with notifying potentially impacted individuals. On January 10, 2020, the City, through CentralSquare, provided written notice of this incident to affected individuals, which includes fourteen (14) Maryland residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

We take the confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information very seriously. The City has strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. After receiving notice from CentralSquare, the City took steps to understand the impact the CentralSquare data security incident had on City data. Third-party forensic investigators were engaged, and with their assistance, the investigation determined that payment card information entered between August 26, 2019, and October 26, 2019, could have been affected by the CentralSquare incident.

Upon confirmation of this information, the City worked to identify those individuals who may have made payments during this period. The City immediately stood up a new server with a new version of the Click2Gov website while it assessed the security of the old version of the Click2Gov website on the original server. Additionally, the City took steps to confirm and further strengthen the security of its systems, and the City is reviewing its security policies and procedures as part of its ongoing commitment to information security. The City is working with law enforcement and notified relevant regulators.

CentralSquare is offering the City's customers a twelve-month subscription to a free credit monitoring service offered through TransUnion. For instructions on how to enroll, please refer to the attached brochure. Additionally, the City is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank.

The City is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

EXHIBIT A	The notification indicates that a potential data security issue with CentralSquare's online payment portal, Click2Gov, could have enabled unauthorized access to certain payment card information from the customer's internet browser window during payment transactions, and that alterations to the applicable code of Click2Gov were responsible for this issue. CentralSquare later confirmed that payment transactions could have been affected between August 26, 2019, and October 26, 2019, and that the unauthorized code was capable of capturing customer information, such as name, address, credit/debit card number, card type, printed security code, and expiration date.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [Name],

We are writing to inform you that you may have been affected by a data security incident involving CentralSquare Technologies (CentralSquare), a third-party vendor that provides utility billing services to the City of Port Orange.

On November 6, 2019, the City received notice from CentralSquare of a potential data security issue within the online payment portal, Click2Gov.

On December 4, 2019, CentralSquare confirmed that the time period in which the payment transactions may have been affected is from August 27, 2019, through October 26, 2019.

CentralSquare advised that the unauthorized code was capable of capturing customer information, such as name, address, credit/debit card number, card type, printed security code, and expiration date.

Therefore, it is possible that your information could have been obtained by an authorized party.

After receiving notice from CentralSquare, we took steps to understand the impact the CentralSquare data security incident had on City data. Third-party forensic investigators were engaged, and with their assistance, the investigation determined that payment card information entered from August 27, 2019, through October 18, 2019, could have been affected by the CentralSquare incident.

For Oregon residents: You are advised to report any suspected identity theft to law enforcement, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Oregon Attorney General.

For Colorado, Georgia, and New Jersey residents: You may obtain one or more (depending on the state) additional copies of your credit report, free of charge. You must contact each of the credit bureaus directly to obtain such additional report(s).

Annual Credit Report: You may also order a free annual credit report. To do so, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-887-322-8228. You can also order your free annual credit report by mailing a completed Annual Credit Report Request Form (available from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) to: Annual Credit Report Request, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

Security Freeze: You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.

To place a security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus listed above and provide the following information: (1) your full name; (2) SSN; (3) date of birth; (4) the addresses where you have lived over the past 5 years; (5) proof of current address, such as a utility bill or telephone bill; (6) a copy of a government-issued identification card; (7) if you are the victim of identity theft, the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency; and (8) if you are not the victim of identity theft, payment by check, money order, or credit card.

Fraud Alert: As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years. A fraud alert indicates to any business requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a victim of fraud and requires the business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. A fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit, but it may cause some delay if you are applying for credit.

Federal Trade Commission: Visit the website for more information on how to protect yourself against identity theft and safeguarding your electronic devices from viruses and other malicious software by: Learning how to make protecting yourself from identity thieves part of your daily routine by visiting consumer.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338) to learn more about identity theft and protective steps you can take or file a report. You can also contact the FTC at: Identity Theft Clearinghouse, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington,	The breach was caused by an outside party accessing information through phishing attack emails from the email accounts of two employees.

At Health Quest Systems, Inc. (HQ), we are committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our patients' information. Therefore, we regret to inform you about our ongoing investigation of an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

On October 25, 2019, through our investigation of a phishing email incident, HQ determined that some of your information may have been contained in employee email accounts accessed by an unauthorized party. HQ first learned of a potential incident in July 2018, when numerous HQ employees were deceived by a phishing scheme, which resulted in certain HQ employees being tricked into inadvertently disclosing their email account credentials to an unauthorized party.

Upon learning of the incident, the employee email accounts in question were secured, and a leading cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist us in investigating this matter. As part of the investigation, HQ performed a comprehensive review of the voluminous contents of the email accounts in question to determine if they contained any sensitive information. Through this time-consuming review, which was completed on November 8, 2019, HQ determined that the information contained in the accounts may have included your name, Social Security number, driver's license issuing state and number, passport number, financial account information, health insurance information, and clinical information related to care you received at HQ or one of our affiliates.

Although, to date, we have no evidence that any of your information has been misused or was, in fact, viewed or accessed, out of an abundance of caution, we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements for any unauthorized activity. As a precaution, we have arranged for you to receive a complimentary one-year membership to Experian's IdentityWorksSM credit monitoring service. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorksSM is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on identity theft prevention and IdentityWorksSM, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

We regret any inconvenience or concern this may cause you. We are taking steps to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, including the implementation of multi-factor authentication for email, as well as additional procedures to further expand and strengthen our security processes. We are also providing additional training to our employees regarding phishing emails and other cybersecurity issues.

Netchex helped us reset our administrative password and configure security features to help guard against this type of unauthorized access from happening again. At this time, we are not aware of any unauthorized access to our network or underlying systems or misuse of the potentially compromised information.

Fraud Alert: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze: You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources: You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state. Residents of Maryland, North Carolina, and Rhode Island can obtain more information from their Attorneys General using the contact information below.

Re: Notice of data security breach

Dear All,

We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. For this reason, we are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have allowed an unauthorized person to access some of your personal information.

What happened?

On [date], we were informed by three contractors about irregularities regarding their payroll processed on [date]. We immediately notified our online payroll service provider, Netchex, which conducted an investigation. We use an administrative account to process payroll, and we access the account using an administrator username and password. Netchex's investigation found that between November 3, 2019, and December 20, 2019, an unauthorized person accessed our administrative account by logging in with the valid username and password credentials.

What information was involved?

Our administrative account has access to all demographic information stored with Netchex, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, bank routing numbers, and other sensitive personal information. While we do not have evidence that the intruder actually accessed or acquired such information, it would have been possible.

What we are doing.

We immediately notified Netchex, and their information security team swiftly launched an investigation into this matter. Netchex helped us reset our administrative password and configure security features to help guard against this type of unauthorized access from happening again. At this time, we are not aware of any unauthorized access to our network or underlying systems or misuse of the potentially compromised information.

What you can do.

Please regularly change your Netchex account password and do not share it with others. You should also remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring your credit report for unauthorized activity. You may also consider placing a fraud alert or credit freeze with each of the three credit bureaus, which may be contacted here:

Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report.

While Phoenix Children's is notifying you of this incident, Phoenix Children's does not waive any rights or defenses relating to the incident or this notice, or the applicability of Maryland law on personal jurisdiction.

NATURE OF THE SECURITY BREACH OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR ACCESS

Phoenix Children's recently determined that an unauthorized individual was able to remotely access the email accounts of seven (7) Phoenix Children's employees. Upon its discovery of the incident, Phoenix Children's immediately took action, including securing the email account credentials and retaining a leading forensic security firm to investigate and confirm the overall security of its email and computer systems. On November 15, 2019, Phoenix Children's determined that the personal information that was in the impacted email accounts included the name and certain limited medical information of the Maryland resident. At this point, Phoenix Children's is not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a result of this incident and cannot confirm if any personal information was actually obtained by an unauthorized party. Nevertheless, because there was an email account compromise and Phoenix Children's cannot isolate exactly what, if any, information may have been obtained, Phoenix Children's is notifying all individuals whose personal information could have been accessed.

NUMBER OF MARYLAND RESIDENTS AFFECTED

On January 14, 2020, Phoenix Children's determined that this incident impacted one (1) Maryland resident. Phoenix Children's is mailing notification letters to the impacted individual on January 14-15, 2020. Enclosed is a sample of the notice letter that is being sent to the impacted resident via first-class United States mail.

STEPS TAKEN RELATING TO THE INCIDENT

Upon learning of the incident, Phoenix Children's promptly secured the email accounts to prevent further access. Multi-factor authentication had been enabled prior to this incident. Phoenix Children's also conducted a comprehensive search for any personal information in the impacted email accounts. Finally, Phoenix Children's retained a leading forensic security firm to investigate and confirm the security of its email and computer systems.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT IDENTITY THEFT

Regular monitoring of your credit report helps identify suspicious activity. Under federal law, you are entitled to obtain one free copy of your credit report every twelve months from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies. You can obtain a free copy of your credit report from each agency by calling 1-877-322-8228 or visiting www.annualcreditreport.com. We recommend that you periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover fraudulent activity, you can contact your local law enforcement agency, the attorney general of your state, or the Federal Trade Commission. You can also request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file.

You may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze. A fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. Contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. A security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts.

The breach is due to the presence of malware that allowed an unauthorized third party to access information during purchases made through the Hanna Andersson website between September 16 and November 11, 2019, which affected personal information such as name, shipping address, billing address, payment card number, CVV code, and expiration date.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Decron Properties Corp. (Decron) is notifying you of an incident that may have impacted the security of your personal information. Decron wants to provide you with information about the incident, their response, and steps you may take to better protect against possible misuse of your personal information, should you feel it necessary to do so.

Decron became aware of unusual activity in certain Decron email accounts. In response, Decron worked with an outside forensics expert to investigate the nature and scope of the activity. Through this investigation, Decron confirmed that certain email accounts were accessed without authorization on April 28, 2019. Although the investigation was unable to determine whether any information contained in email messages or file attachments stored in the email accounts was actually accessed by an unauthorized actor, they cannot rule out whether that type of activity occurred.

In an abundance of caution, Decron performed a thorough review of the information contained within the impacted email accounts, and on October 24, 2019, determined that your personal information was potentially accessible by the unauthorized actor. They continued reviewing their files to obtain contact information for all impacted individuals through December 24, 2019.

The investigation determined that your name and extra 1 exposed element, extra 1 exposed element, extra 1 exposed element, extra 1 exposed element, extra 1 exposed element were stored within an impacted email account and are therefore potentially at risk for unauthorized access. At this time, Decron is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of your personal information within Decron's care is among their highest priorities. Upon learning of the event, they investigated to determine those individuals that were affected, and secured the compromised email accounts by updating passwords. They also enacted more robust password security policies and implemented multi-factor authentication for their email accounts. They will be taking additional steps to improve security and better protect against similar incidents in the future.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report.

Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for one year.

A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Steps You Can Take to Help Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you, including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT IDENTITY THEFT

Regular monitoring of your credit report helps identify suspicious activity. Under federal law, you are entitled to obtain one free copy of your credit report every twelve months from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies. You can obtain a free copy of your credit report from each agency by calling 1-877-322-8228 or visiting www.annualcreditreport.com. We recommend that you periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover fraudulent activity, you can contact your local law enforcement agency, the attorney general of your state, or the Federal Trade Commission. You can also request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file.

You may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze. A fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. Contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. A security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts.

Re: Notification of Security Incident

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing on behalf of Hanna Andersson, LLC to inform you of a recent security incident involving Hanna Andersson's website. On December 5, 2019, law enforcement informed Hanna Andersson that credit cards used on its website were available for purchase on a dark web site. Hanna Andersson immediately launched an investigation. The investigation has confirmed that Hanna Andersson's third-party e-commerce platform, Salesforce Commerce Cloud, was infected with malware that may have scraped information entered by customers into the platform during the purchase process. The earliest potential date of compromise identified by forensic investigators is September 16, 2019, and the malware was removed on November 11, 2019. Although the investigation to date indicates that not all customers who made purchases through Hanna Andersson's website during that time period were affected, it has not been possible to determine which specific customers were impacted.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT IDENTITY THEFT

Regular monitoring of your credit report helps identify suspicious activity. Under federal law, you are entitled to obtain one free copy of your credit report every twelve months from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies. You can obtain a free copy of your credit report from each agency by calling 1-877-322-8228 or visiting www.annualcreditreport.com. We recommend that you periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover fraudulent activity, you can contact your local law enforcement agency, the attorney general of your state, or the Federal Trade Commission. You can also request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file.

You may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze. A fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. Contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. A security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<Name 1>>

On behalf of Northerner Scandinavia AB, located at Mobelgatan 4, 43133 Molndal, Sweden and which owns Northerner Scandinavia Inc., located at 6 State Rd., Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania 17050 (collectively, Northerner), we are writing to inform you about a recent incident involving the potential exposure of some of your personal information on www.northerner.com (the Northerner Website).

WHAT HAPPENED?

On December 9, 2019, we discovered that unauthorized script was placed on the checkout page of the Northerner Website. The unauthorized script potentially allowed the third party that placed the script to capture information submitted by customers on the checkout page of the Northerner Website if credit card data was entered and the place order button was hit. Upon discovery of the incident, Northerner immediately disabled the credit card payment function on the site and removed the unauthorized script. Through our investigations, we discovered that the unauthorized script was likely placed on the website on or about November 30, 2019.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

The information potentially involved was limited to: First Name; Last Name; Street Address; City; State; Zip/Postal Code; Country; Phone Number; Email Address; Password (if this value was entered to create an account); Payment Card Number; Payment Card Security Code; and Payment Card Month/Year of Expiration if the values for these items were typed into the checkout page on the Northerner Website and the place order button was hit. The unauthorized script may have also captured web browser and operating system information.

WHAT ARE WE DOING?

We immediately began an investigation as soon as we suspected a problem. We quickly contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and brought in a leading forensics firm to assist in our investigation. In addition, we are also taking certain technical precautions in effort to prevent this type of incident from occurring again.

WHAT YOU CAN DO.

1. Monitor Account Statements and Free Credit Reports. You should remain vigilant for incidents of financial fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports.

2. Change Passwords. We recommend you change your password for any online accounts, including accounts with Northerner and any other account on which you used the same or similar information used for your Northerner account.

3. Contact the Federal Trade Commission, Law Enforcement and Credit Bureaus. You may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), your state's Attorney General's office, or law enforcement, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC's websites at www.IdentityTheft.gov and www.ftc.gov/idtheft; call the FTC at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338); or write to: FTC Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:

Equifax (800) 525-6285 P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374-0241 www.equifax.com

TransUnion (800) 916-8800 Fraud Victim Assistance Division P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19022 www.transunion.com

4. Obtain Free Copy of Credit Reports. You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228.

5. Additional Rights Under the FCRA. You also have other rights under the FCRA. For further information about your rights under the FCRA, please visit: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf.

6. Request Fraud Alerts and Security Freezes. You may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file.

In addition, you can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a security freeze at no cost to you:

Equifax (800) 349-9960

Experian (888) 397-3742

TransUnion (888) 909-8872

Placing a security freeze prohibits the agency from releasing any information about your credit report without your written authorization. Security freezes must be placed separately at each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. When requesting a security freeze, you may need to provide the following information:

Your full name, with middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, etc.

Social Security number

Date of birth

Current address and all addresses for the past two years

Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill

Legible copy of a government-issued identification card, such as a state driver's license, state identification card, or military identification.

After receiving your request, each agency will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN or password that you will need to lift or remove the freeze. You should keep the PIN or password in a safe place.

7. Additional Information for Certain States. Please review the last page of this letter for additional information for certain states.

FOR MORE INFORMATION

We regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause you. Please do not hesitate to contact our support agents for this event at <Insert Toll-Free Number> or by sending an email message to hannah.kaber@hayppgroup.com if you have any questions or concerns.

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for one (1) year.

To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<Name 1>>

On behalf of Northerner Scandinavia AB, located at Mobelgatan 4, 43133 Molndal, Sweden and which owns Northerner Scandinavia Inc., located at 6 State Rd., Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania 17050 (collectively, Northerner), we are writing to inform you about a recent incident involving the potential exposure of some of your personal information on www.northerner.com (the Northerner Website).

WHAT HAPPENED?

On December 9, 2019, we discovered that unauthorized script was placed on the checkout page of the Northerner Website. The unauthorized script potentially allowed the third party that placed the script to capture information submitted by customers on the checkout page of the Northerner Website if credit card data was entered and the place order button was hit. Upon discovery of the incident, Northerner immediately disabled the credit card payment function on the site and removed the unauthorized script. Through our investigations, we discovered that the unauthorized script was likely placed on the website on or about November 30, 2019.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

The information potentially involved was limited to: First Name; Last Name; Street Address; City; State; Zip/Postal Code; Country; Phone Number; Email Address; Password (if this value was entered to create an account); Payment Card Number; Payment Card Security Code; and Payment Card Month/Year of Expiration if the values for these items were typed into the checkout page on the Northerner Website and the place order button was hit. The unauthorized script may have also captured web browser and operating system information.

WHAT ARE WE DOING?

We immediately began an investigation as soon as we suspected a problem. We quickly contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and brought in a leading forensics firm to assist in our investigation. In addition, we are also taking certain technical precautions in effort to prevent this type of incident from occurring again.

WHAT YOU CAN DO.

1. Monitor Account Statements and Free Credit Reports. You should remain vigilant for incidents of financial fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports.

2. Change Passwords. We recommend you change your password for any online accounts, including accounts with Northerner and any other account on which you used the same or similar information used for your Northerner account.

3. Contact the Federal Trade Commission, Law Enforcement and Credit Bureaus. You may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), your state's Attorney General's office, or law enforcement, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC's websites at www.IdentityTheft.gov and www.ftc.gov/idtheft; call the FTC at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338); or write to: FTC Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. You may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:

Equifax (800) 525-6285 P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374-0241 www.equifax.com

Experian (888) 397-3742 P.O. Box 9701 Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com

TransUnion (800) 916-8800 Fraud Victim Assistance Division P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19022 www.transunion.com

4. Obtain Free Copy of Credit Reports. You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228.

5. Additional Rights Under the FCRA. You also have other rights under the FCRA. For further information about your rights under the FCRA, please visit: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf.

6. Request Fraud Alerts and Security Freezes. You may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition, you can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a security freeze at no cost to you:

Equifax (800) 349-9960

Experian (888) 397-3742

TransUnion (888) 909-8872

Placing a security freeze prohibits the agency from releasing any information about your credit report without your written authorization. Security freezes must be placed separately at each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. When requesting a security freeze, you may need to provide the following information:

Your full name, with middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, etc.

Social Security number

Date of birth

Current address and all addresses for the past two years

Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill

Legible copy of a government-issued identification card, such as a state driver's license, state identification card, or military identification.

After receiving your request, each agency will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN or password that you will need to lift or remove the freeze. You should keep the PIN or password in a safe place.

7. Additional Information for Certain States. Please review the last page of this letter for additional information for certain states.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Madison Area YMCA (Madison Y), 111 Kings Road Madison, NJ 07940, and write to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to three (3) Maryland residents. The investigation into this event is ongoing and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Madison Y does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law, the applicability of the Maryland data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On or about October 18, 2019, Madison Y learned of suspicious activity in a Madison Y employee's email account. Upon learning of the activity, Madison Y immediately took steps to secure the employee's email account and launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the activity. With the assistance of third-party forensic experts, Madison Y determined that an unknown actor gained access to two Madison Y employee email accounts for a limited time period on October 18, 2019. During this limited timeframe, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain emails and attachments within the account. While the investigation was able to confirm access to the accounts, the investigation was unable to rule out access to any emails or attachments. As a result, with the assistance of third-party forensics, Madison Y began an extensive review of the email accounts to determine whether they contained any protected information and to whom the information relates. On December 5, 2019, Madison Y completed the programmatic and manual review and determined that the email accounts contained personal information. Madison Y then immediately launched a review of its files to ascertain address information in order to provide those individuals whose information was present in the accounts.

The types of personal information potentially impacted in relation to this incident include name and Social Security number. The impacted data elements were not the same for each affected individual.

Notice to Maryland Residents

On January 15, 2020, Madison Y began mailing written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes three (3) Maryland residents. Written notice to the individuals is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering this incident, Madison Y promptly began an investigation with the assistance of a third-party forensic investigator to determine the nature and scope of this incident, including identifying the individuals who may be affected, putting in place resources to assist them, and providing them with notice of this incident. While Madison Y is not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of the information, Madison Y is providing affected individuals access to twelve (12) months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services, through TransUnion. Additionally, Madison Y is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements, to monitor free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for one (1) year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift, or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you, including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

What Happened

In December 2019, Legalinc was contacted by a security consultant that claimed he had found a vulnerability in the database used to store customer business formation documents.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT IDENTITY THEFT

Regular monitoring of your credit report helps identify suspicious activity. Under federal law, you are entitled to obtain one free copy of your credit report every twelve months from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies. You can obtain a free copy of your credit report from each agency by calling 1-877-322-8228 or visiting www.annualcreditreport.com. We recommend that you periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover fraudulent activity, you can contact your local law enforcement agency, the attorney general of your state, or the Federal Trade Commission. You can also request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file.

You may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze. A fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. Contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. A security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts.

CLIENT ADDRESS

Dear CLIENT:

We are writing to inform you about a recent incident at William Blair & Company, L.L.C. (William Blair). In January 2020, a 2019 year-end account statement containing certain client information pertaining to your account was mailed to the wrong address. The inadvertently disclosed client information contained the full name on your account and account number. The information did NOT contain date of birth, social security number or address.

This incident happened because a client requested an address update for their account but your account was accidentally updated since the account number was 1 digit different than yours. It was purely an isolated human error. The same day the client received the statement he contacted us and confirmed he had destroyed the document without retaining a copy.

Out of an abundance of caution, we are placing heightened scrutiny of any requested money or security movements from your accounts. If you would like us to change your account number on any affected account, please let us know. We do not believe that you would need to complete any additional paperwork in order to change the account number on your accounts.

While the information was received by a long-term partner and client of the firm (and subsequently destroyed), it is always prudent to monitor activity in your accounts. Below is a checklist of suggestions to further protect your information:

1. Review your bank, credit card, debit card and other financial account statements over the next twelve to twenty-four months and immediately report any suspicious activity.

2. Monitor your credit reports with the major credit reporting agencies.

Under Vermont law, you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report from those agencies every twelve months. Call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report if you find:

Accounts you did not open.

Inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate.

Inaccurate personal information, such as home address and Social Security number.

3. If you do find suspicious activity on your credit reports or other account statements, call your local police or sheriff's office and file a report of identity theft. Get a copy of the police report. You may need to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up your records, and also to access some services that are free to identity theft victims.

4. If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or on your other account statements, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit files so creditors will contact you before opening new accounts. Call any of the three credit reporting agencies at the number below to place fraud alerts with all three agencies.

Equifax Experian TransUnion

6. Even if you do not find suspicious activity on your credit report or on your other account statements, it is important that you check your credit report for the next two years. Just call one of the numbers in paragraph 2 above to order your reports or to keep a fraud alert in place.

Helpful information about fighting identity theft, placing a security freeze and obtaining a free copy of your credit report is available on the Vermont Attorney General's website at http://www.ago.vermont.gov. Another helpful source is the Federal Trade Commission website available at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/.

Sincerely,

William Blair & Company, L.L.C.	The data breach was an unintended disclosure not involving hacking or a physical loss. The client's personal information contained in an account statement was mailed to the wrong address due to an isolated human error which resulted in client information being disclosed to a long-term partner and client of the firm. However, the statement was subsequently destroyed. An abundance of caution was put in place by the affected organization, including placing heightened scrutiny of any requested money or security movements from clients’ accounts.

Re: Supplemental Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear Sir or Madam:

We continue to represent Calibre CPA Group (Calibre), where one of its primary offices is located at 7501 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 1200 West, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. We write to supplement our October 10, 2019 notice to your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to certain Washington residents.

By providing this notice, Calibre does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Washington law, the applicability of the Washington data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Calibre's investigation, as described in our prior notice, reviewing of the contents of the impacted source documents, the types of protected information contained in the documents, and to which individuals the information relates, continued following the initial notice. Calibre continued a lengthy review of its files to ascertain address information for the impacted individuals. This included continued	Based on the provided information, there is no clear indication of how the data was breached.

We recently concluded an investigation and analysis of a data security incident involving unauthorized
access to three employee email accounts that contained personal information. Upon learning of the
incident, we immediately took steps to secure the email accounts, launched an investigation, and engaged
a cybersecurity firm to assist. Findings from our investigation indicate that an unauthorized individual
gained access to those employee email accounts at various times between June 25, 2019, and September
8, 2019. & On December 10,
2019, after extensive review of the email contents, the investigation determined that the personal
information of one Maryland resident was in the account, including the individualâ€™s name and
credit or debit card number in conjunction with security information.	The breach involved unauthorized access to employee email accounts by an outside party, indicating hacking as the type of breach.

password or PIN, credit card number or debit card number in combination with any required security code,

unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, dln & Viking Partners recently discovered that someone remotely accessed the email account of one of 
its employees without authorization. Upon learning of the incident, it promptly contained the 
incident by securing the email account to prevent further access. The incident was limited to one 
email account, which operates outside of and separate from Viking Partnersâ€™ internal network, 
which was not affected. 
At this point, Viking Partners is not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a 
result of this incident, and does not know if any personal information was ever actually viewed 
or acquired by the unauthorized party. &Nevertheless, as part of its investigation and out of an 
abundance of caution, it searched for any personal information in the email account that could 
have been viewed, and on November 6, 2019, it determined that the account contained the 
personal information of some individuals, including their name, Social Security number and/or 
driverâ€™s license number.	Although the data breach was a result of unauthorized access to an email account, there is no evidence that hacking or physical loss occurred. Additionally, the personal information was unintentionally disclosed without the involvement of an insider, and there is little information available to confirm if the incident was intentional or unintentional. Therefore, the breach can be classified as a "DISC" type of breach.
unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, dln & We value and respect the privacy of your information and take protecting your privacy seriously. 
Unfortunately, we are writing to notify you of a data security incident that may have involved 
some of your personal information. We learned that a phishing email was sent from one of 
our employeeâ€™s email accounts. Upon learning of the incident, we promptly secured the email 
account and retained a leading forensic security firm to investigate and confirm the security of 
our email and computer systems. & The forensic investigation did not see evidence of any personal information having been 
acquired, but we could not rule out the possibility that someone accessed information while 
they were in the email account. As such, we searched the entire account for any personal 
information that was contained therein. On November 6, 2019, our investigation determined 
that the employeeâ€™s email account contained some of your personal information, including your 
name, driverâ€™s license number and Social Security number or EIN, and for some people date 
of birth and/or address	The unauthorized access to the employee's email account indicates that an outside party hacked into the system. The fact that a phishing email was sent is further evidence of this. In addition, the hiring of a forensic security firm confirms that the company suspects a hack.

NATURE OF THE SECURITY BREACH OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR ACCESS

Viking Partners recently discovered that someone remotely accessed the email account of one of its employees without authorization. Upon learning of the incident, it promptly contained the incident by securing the email account to prevent further access. The incident was limited to one email account, which operates outside of and separate from Viking Partners' internal network, which was not affected. At this point, Viking Partners is not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a result of this incident, and does not know if any personal information was ever actually viewed or acquired by the unauthorized party. Nevertheless, as part of its investigation and out of an abundance of caution, it searched for any personal information in the email account that could have been viewed, and on November 6, 2019, it determined that the account contained the personal information of some individuals, including their name, Social Security number, and/or driver's license number. Viking Partners has been working to locate current addresses for the potentially impacted individuals and arrange for complimentary identity theft protection services, and is providing notice to people whose information was in the account.

NUMBER OF MARYLAND RESIDENTS AFFECTED

It was determined that four Maryland residents may have been impacted by this incident. Viking Partners is notifying the potentially impacted individuals of the situation by letter today. Enclosed is a sample copy of the notice that is being sent to the impacted individuals. The type of potentially impacted information referenced in the actual letters sent is tailored to each individual.

STEPS TAKEN RELATING TO THE INCIDENT

Upon becoming aware of the incident, Viking Partners promptly terminated the credentials used to access the email accounts. Viking Partners also has reviewed its internal security procedures. It has adopted multi-factor authentication for its email systems and has retrained employees on good email security practices. Viking Partners is also providing complimentary identity theft protection services to the impacted individual through Experian.

Re: Security Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General Frosh:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Valley Exposition Service (Valley), to notify you of a security incident involving one Maryland resident. Valley recently concluded its ongoing investigation into an email phishing incident involving unauthorized access to a limited number of employee email accounts that contained personal information.

Upon learning of the incident, Valley immediately took steps to secure the email account and launched an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm. The investigation determined that an unauthorized actor gained access to three employee email accounts at various times between June 25, 2019 and September 8, 2019. On December 10, 2019, after extensive review of the email contents, the investigation determined that the personal information of one Maryland resident was in the account, including the individuals name and credit or debit card number in conjunction with security information.

Beginning on January 9, 2020, Valley mailed notification letters via United States Postal Service First-Class mail in accordance with Md. Code Ann., Com. Law 14-3504 in substantially the same form as the enclosed letter. Valley has provided a telephone number for potentially affected individuals to call with any questions they may have about the incident.

To help prevent a similar incident in the future, we are taking steps to enhance our existing security protocols and re-educating our staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

M. Scott Koller

Dear [Recipient]:

We are writing to inform you that we recently identified and addressed a security incident that may have involved some of your information. This letter explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened

We recently concluded an investigation and analysis of a data security incident involving unauthorized access to three employee email accounts that contained personal information. Upon learning of the incident, we immediately took steps to secure the email accounts, launched an investigation, and engaged a cybersecurity firm to assist. Findings from our investigation indicate that an unauthorized individual gained access to those employee email accounts at various times between June 25, 2019, and September 8, 2019.

What Information Was Involved

Based on the investigation, we have confirmed that an unauthorized third party gained access to the information in that employee's email account, and consequently, gained access to your personal information, including possibly your name; date of birth; financial account number; financial account password or PIN, credit card number or debit card number in combination with any required security code, access code or password that would permit access to your financial accounts; email address and password; username and password, or protected health information.

What You Can Do

You should always remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your free credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

Unfortunately, we are writing to notify you of a data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. We learned that a phishing email was sent from one of our employees' email accounts. Upon learning of the incident, we promptly secured the email account and retained a leading forensic security firm to investigate and confirm the security of our email and computer systems.

What Information Was Involved

The forensic investigation did not see evidence of any personal information having been acquired, but we could not rule out the possibility that someone accessed information while they were in the email account. As such, we searched the entire account for any personal information that was contained therein. On November 6, 2019, our investigation determined that the employee's email account contained some of your personal information, including your name and Social Security number or EIN, and for some people date of birth and/or address.

Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf.

Alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies.

TransUnion 1-800-888-4213 www.transunion.com P.O. Box 1000 Chester, PA 19016

Fraud Alerts: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for one (1) year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. as specified below to find out more information:

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General Frosh:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Honeybee Health (Honeybee), to notify you of a security incident involving Maryland residents. Honeybee Health is an online pharmacy that verifies, fills, and mails prescription medications to individuals across the United States.

On November 19, 2019, Honeybee learned that a small number of its customers experienced unauthorized charges on their payment card after they used the card to make a purchase at honeybeehealth.com (the Website). Honeybee immediately launched an internal investigation, and a leading computer forensic firm was hired to assist. The investigation identified that unauthorized code was added to the Websites checkout page on November 16. The code was removed from the Website as soon as it was found on November 19. On November 28, Honeybee was reviewing the Website code and discovered that the unauthorized code had re-appeared. The script was again removed the same day. Shortly thereafter, on December 2, Honeybee found a similar script on the Website. The code was removed and Honeybee moved the affected server behind additional protective security layers. The unauthorized code was designed to copy information entered during checkout and send the information to an unauthorized person. That information included the name, billing and shipping address, and payment card number, expiration date, and security code (CVV) of certain Honeybee customers that made a purchase between November 16-19, November 23-29, and on December 2, 2019. If the customer also provided the name of other medications he or she is taking, medical conditions that he or she may have, or the name and contact information of his or her provider, that information may have also been obtained by the unauthorized person. The code did not copy order information that was not typed into a text field during the checkout process.

On January 17, 2020, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Com. Law 14-3504, Honeybee will begin mailing notification letters via U.S. First-Class mail to 15 Maryland residents in substantially the same form as the enclosed letter. In addition, Honeybee has established a dedicated call center where individuals may obtain more information regarding the incident.

To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, Honeybee is taking steps to enhance its security environment, including moving the server behind additional protective security layers and scanning its Website for malicious code.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

Aleksandra M. S. Vold
Counsel

Honeybee Health understands the importance of protecting our customers' information. Regrettably, we are writing to inform you of an incident that involves some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

On November 19, 2019, we learned that a small number of our customers experienced unauthorized charges on their payment card after they used the card to make a purchase at honeybeehealth.com (the Website). We immediately launched an internal investigation, and a leading computer forensic firm was hired to assist. The investigation identified that unauthorized code was added to the checkout page on the Website on November 16, 2019. The code was removed from the Website as soon as it was found on November 19, 2019. The code was designed to copy information entered during checkout and send the information to an unauthorized person. That information may have included your name, billing and shipping address, and payment card number, expiration date, and security code (CVV) for the card you used to make a purchase on the Website between November 16, 2019 and November 19, 2019. If during that purchase you provided the name of other medications you are taking, medical conditions you have, or the name and contact information for your provider, that information may have also been obtained by an unauthorized person. The code did not copy order information that was not typed in during the checkout process.

Although this incident only involved a limited number of Honeybee customers, we want to remind you to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements for any unauthorized activity. Immediately report any unauthorized charges to your financial institution because the payment card network rules generally restrict cardholder	The data breach was the result of the unauthorized code added to the checkout page of the Honeybee Health website, designed to copy information entered during checkout and send it to an unauthorized person.

Dear [NAME],

We are writing to notify you of a recent incident that may affect the security of your personal information. This letter will provide you with information concerning the event, measures we have taken since discovering the incident, and suggestions on how to protect your personal information.

What Happened?

NEA recently became aware of suspicious activity related to an employee email account. We immediately blocked further access to the affected account, and conducted an investigation to determine the reason for the suspicious activity. With the assistance of forensics experts, we determined that the employee's account was accessed without authorization from November 13-15, 2019.

Upon learning this information, we performed a comprehensive review of the affected email account to determine whether it contained any personal information. This review found that the compromised email account held documents containing the full names and social security numbers of some individuals. While we are unable to determine whether any bad actors viewed this information, it was potentially accessible at the time of the incident. Because your information was present in the compromised email account, we are notifying you in an abundance of caution so that you can take appropriate steps to protect your personal information.

What Information Was Involved?

We cannot confirm whether any information was viewed by the unauthorized individual(s). However, NEA's investigation confirmed that information present in the account at the time of the incident included your full name and social security number.

What We Are Doing.

NEA values your privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. We have security measures in place that allowed us to quickly identify and contain this incident, and we continue to confirm and strengthen the security of our systems. We have also provided relevant regulatory notices.

We are notifying potentially affected individuals, including you, so that you can take further steps to protect your information. To assist you in doing so, we have secured the services of CyberScout to provide identity monitoring services at no cost to you for 18 months.

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity.

We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission. To file a complaint with the FTC, go to www.identitytheft.gov, or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261. Complaints filed with the FTC will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, which is a database made available to law enforcement agencies.

Monitor Your Free Credit Reports.

You should also remain vigilant about monitoring your credit report. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348.

Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies is provided below:

Equifax (888) 766-0008 www.equifax.com P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374

Experian (888) 397-3742 www.experian.com P.O. Box 2002 Allen, TX 75013

TransUnion (800) 680-7289 www.transunion.com P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19106

Place a Fraud Alert and/or Security Freeze.

We recommend placing a fraud alert on your credit report. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. The initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year, and you can renew it after one year. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any one of the three credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. You may also want to consider placing a security freeze on your credit report, which will prevent potential creditors from obtaining your credit report. That makes it less likely that an identify thief can open new accounts in your name. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact each of the major consumer reporting agencies listed above.

File Your Taxes Early.

File your taxes before a scammer can. Tax identity theft happens when someone uses your Social Security number to get a tax refund or a job. Respond right away to letters from the IRS.

Be Alert for Telephone Scams.

Do not believe anyone who calls and says you will be arrested unless you pay for taxes or debt even if they have part or all of your Social Security number, or they say they are from the IRS.

Further Educate Yourself on Avoiding Identity Theft.

You can further educate yourself regarding identity theft, fraud alerts, security freezes, and the steps you can take to protect yourself, by contacting the consumer reporting agencies, the Federal Trade Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, or your state Attorney General. For example, you may wish to review Identity Theft: A Recovery Plan, a comprehensive guide from the FTC to help you guard against and deal with identity theft, along with other tips provided by the Federal Trade Commission on how to avoid identity theft. For more information, please visit www.identitytheft.gov, or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261. The IRS also has guidance concerning identify protection at https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams.	An employee email account was accessed without authorization from November 13-15, 2019, and upon reviewing the email account, documents containing the full names and social security numbers of some individuals were found.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Environmental StoneWorks, LLC (ESW), to provide notice of a security incident. ESW's ongoing investigation into an email phishing incident recently determined that an unauthorized party could have accessed personal information in some ESW employees' email accounts. Upon learning of the incident, ESW immediately took steps to secure the accounts, launched an investigation, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist.

ESW's investigation determined that an unauthorized person obtained access to the email accounts at various times between July 18, 2019, and December 10, 2019. The investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized person. Out of an abundance of caution, ESW conducted a thorough review of the emails and attachments that may have been accessed and, on December 23, 2019, determined that the emails or attachments contained the name of one Maryland resident in combination with a Social Security number.

Today, ESW will begin sending notification letters via First Class Mail to the Maryland resident whose personal information was contained in the accessed email accounts. This notice is being provided in accordance with Md. Code Ann., Com. Law 14-3504. Enclosed is a sample copy of the letter.

ESW is offering one year of complimentary credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft protection services through Kroll to the individuals whose Social Security number or driver's license number were contained in the accessed accounts. ESW is also providing a call center for the individuals to call with questions regarding the incident.

To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, ESW is re-educating employees regarding phishing emails and enhancing existing security measures.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

To Whom It May Concern:

On behalf of Security Resources, LLC ("Company"), I am writing to notify you of a security incident involving an inadvertent disclosure of personal information that may have affected 1 Maryland resident.

On January 13, 2020, an email was inadvertently sent to the personal emails of seven Company employees. The email included an attachment containing the personal information of certain Company employees, including name, address, social security number, and employee identification number. While the data was separated in a second tab that was not readily apparent when the spreadsheet was opened, it could be viewed by the seven individuals if they switched tabs.

Upon discovery of this error, the Company immediately attempted to retrieve the email, but, because it was sent outside of the Company's network, this was not possible. Accordingly, the Company quickly contacted each of the seven employees to demand that they delete the email and its attachment in its entirety from all electronic and physical locations (including deleted items folders), as well as from any media to which it may be saved. Additionally, in an abundance of caution, the employees were required to sign a certification attesting to the destruction of the email and its attachment.

This week, the Company will send a letter to each affected person informing them of this incident. The form of the notification letter to be sent to the affected person in Maryland is enclosed.

If you should have any additional questions or need further information regarding this incident, please do not hesitate to contact me at 585-263-1494.

Important Identity Theft Information: Additional Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Identity

The following are additional steps you may wish to take to protect your identity.

Review Your Accounts and Credit Reports

Regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies. When you receive your credit report, look it over with care. If you notice anything suspicious - accounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate, personal information such as a home address or Social Security number that is not accurate - or you see anything you do not understand, call the credit reporting agency at the number listed in the report. If you find fraudulent or suspicious activity in your credit reports, you should promptly report the matter to the proper law enforcement authorities. Follow the steps recommended above for reporting fraudulent or suspicious activity to law enforcement.

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com by calling toll free 1.877.322.8228, or by mailing an Annual Credit Report Request Form (available at www.annualcreditreport.com) to:

We are writing to inform you that some of your personal information has been compromised. On January 6, 2020, United Parcel Service (UPS) Corporate Security notified Giant Food that a package containing paper records with information about Giant Food associates and their pension contributions had been lost. The package was shipped by Giant Food on November 4, 2019, but never arrived at its intended destination, the FELRA and UFCW pension offices. Giant Food contacted UPS on November 7, 2019, to initiate a lost package investigation. UPS conducted initial searches of its facilities, the box's tracking history, and CCTV footage, but these were unsuccessful in locating the package. In mid-November 2019, UPS indicated that the box might have been sent to a warehouse for lost and damaged items, but on November 19, 2019, UPS informed Giant Food that it did not find the package at that warehouse. On December 2, 2019, Giant Food contacted UPS leadership and requested additional searches. UPS agreed to launch a full-scale investigation, which targeted all locations of the shipment's logistical journey, but the package was still not found.

The lost package contained personal information, including your name, Social Security number, gender, employment status (active/inactive and full-/part-time), and pension contribution amounts. We have conducted an investigation and found no evidence indicating that any of the information in the box has been misused as a result of this issue.

We understand that this may cause inconvenience to you, and we take our obligation to safeguard your personal information very seriously. Therefore, we are alerting you about this issue so that you can take steps to help protect yourself. You are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). To order your free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

Order Your Free Credit Report.

To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit reports only through their websites, toll-free numbers, or request forms.

When you receive your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look in the inquiries section for names of creditors from whom you haven't requested credit. Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. The consumer reporting agency will be able to tell you when that is the case. Look in the personal information section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as home address and Social Security number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the consumer reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. Errors in this information may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate consumer reporting agency by telephone and in writing. Consumer reporting agency staff will review your report with you. If the information can't be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved. Information that can't be explained also should be reported to your local police or sheriff's office because it may signal criminal activity.

Report Incidents.

If you detect any unauthorized transactions in a financial account, promptly notify your payment card company or financial institution. If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud, promptly report the incident to law enforcement, the FTC, and your state Attorney General. If you believe your identity has been stolen, the FTC recommends that you take these steps: Close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. For streamlined checklists and sample letters to help guide you through the recovery process, please visit https://www.identitytheft.gov/. File a local police report. Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors and any others that may require proof of the identity theft crime.

You can contact the FTC to learn more about how to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft and how to repair identity theft:

Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File.

To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer reporting agencies. For more information on fraud alerts, you also may contact the FTC as described above.

You may wish to place a security freeze (also known as a credit freeze) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies without your consent. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. There is no charge to place or lift a security freeze.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam,

We represent Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (Pacific Specialty) 2200 Geng Road Suite 200 Palo Alto, CA 94303 and are writing to notify you of a recent incident that may affect the security of the personal information of certain Maryland residents. The investigation into this event is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Pacific Specialty does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Security Incident

On June 14, 2019 Pacific Specialty became aware of a pattern of suspicious activity relating to certain Pacific Specialty employee email accounts. In response, Pacific Specialty worked with third party specialists to investigate the nature and scope of the activity. Through this investigation, Pacific Specialty determined that certain Pacific Specialty-managed email accounts were accessed by an unauthorized actor between March 20 and March 30, 2019. Pacific Specialty did not determine whether information stored in the email accounts was viewed or acquired by the unauthorized actor. However, Pacific Specialty could not rule out the occurrence of such activities. Therefore, Pacific Specialty performed a thorough review of the information contained within the potentially-impacted email accounts, and on November 7, 2019 Pacific Specialty became aware of the identities of the individuals whose information was contained within the impacted accounts. Pacific Specialty worked to find contact information for impacted individuals to ensure those impacted individuals received notice of this event. On January 14, 2020 Pacific Specialty confirmed the number and identities of Maryland residents whose personal information may have been impacted.

The types of personal information impacted vary by individual. However, Pacific Specialty's investigation determined that names, Drivers license number and other government issued identification number, and financial account number to three (3) Maryland residents were impacted by this incident.

Notice to Maryland Residents

Pacific Specialty began providing written notice of this incident to three (3) Maryland residents on January 24, 2020, in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon learning of the event, Pacific Specialty investigated to determine those individuals who were affected, and secured the compromised email accounts by updating passwords. Pacific Specialty continues to take additional steps to improve security and better protect against similar incidents in the future.

What Happened?

On June 13, 2019, Crouch learned of unusual activity within its email environment.

On July 15, 2019, the forensics firm determined that a Crouch email account which had been accessed without authorization contained personal information belonging to some Crouch clients which may have been accessed or acquired by an unauthorized individual. Crouch then worked diligently to identify mailing addresses for each potentially affected individual in order to provide notification of this incident. Notably, Crouch has no evidence indicating that any potentially impacted information has been misused.

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO FURTHER PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant and review your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC).

Copy of Credit Report:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

We are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have impacted the security of your personal information. On June 14, 2019, Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (Pacific Specialty) became aware of suspicious activity relating to certain Pacific Specialty employee email accounts. In response, Pacific Specialty changed the employees' account password and worked with an outside forensics expert to investigate the nature and scope of the activity. The investigation determined that certain Pacific Specialty email accounts were accessed without authorization between March 20, 2019, and March 30, 2019. The period of unauthorized access varied for each account at issue. Every potentially accessible file within the impacted accounts was reviewed to determine what files may have been accessible to the unauthorized actor. On November 7, 2019, we became aware of the identities of the individuals whose information was included in the impacted accounts. We continued working to obtain contact information for impacted individuals through January 14, 2020.

The investigation determined that your name and <<Breached Elements>> may have been accessible by the unauthorized actor. Although this information may have been accessible, there is no indication that this information was actually viewed by an unauthorized actor. However, we are notifying you of this incident in an abundance of caution.

Upon learning of the event, we investigated to determine those individuals that were affected, and secured the compromised accounts by changing password and enabling multi-factor authentication on all email accounts. We will be taking additional steps to improve security and better protect against similar incidents in the future.

Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Against Identity Theft and Fraud, which contains information on what you can do to better protect against possible misuse of your information. As a safeguard, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for one year provided by TransUnion Interactive.

Dear [Name],

We are writing to inform you about a privacy issue that involves some of your health information. On December 10, 2019, UnitedHealthcare was notified that an unauthorized individual accessed provider claims documentation that contained some of your health information through our provider portal. We believe that this access occurred between July 30, 2019, and November 13, 2019.

The information that was involved in this incident includes your first and last name, health plan [alternate] ID number, group/policy information, date of service, provider name, and claim information. However, this incident did not involve the disclosure of your Social Security number, driver's license number, or any financial account information.

Upon discovering the incident, we took prompt action to investigate the matter. We immediately blocked access to our provider portal and determined how the unauthorized individual gained access. We have enhanced our controls and are working with federal law enforcement on the ongoing investigation.

We deeply regret this incident and any inconvenience or concern that it may cause. As a precaution, we are offering one year of LifeLock identity theft protection services at no cost to you.

Dear Attorney General Ferguson:

Please allow this letter to serve as a follow-up to the November 15, 2019 security incident notification. The City of Lacey's vendor recently provided a data query that identifies the customer accounts that may have been exposed. The number of potentially impacted customer accounts is 6,209. The City's vendor indicated that malicious actors had altered application code, which could have enabled the unauthorized copying of card data from a citizen browser during a transaction. The investigation is ongoing. The City of Lacey continues to cooperate with law enforcement.

The City of Lacey takes its role of safeguarding personal information seriously. The City's vendor believes the exposure points have been mitigated. However, the breached website portal was not restarted subsequent to shutting down the payment portal. The City of Lacey started a new payment portal on January 22, 2020.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

The Stow Company (Stow) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have affected the security of some of your personal information. Although there is currently no evidence that your information has been misused as a result of this incident, we are providing you with information on the event, steps we have taken in response, and information on how you can help protect your personal information should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On October 3, 2019, Stow became aware of suspicious activity in certain employee email accounts. We immediately launched an investigation to determine the full scope and cause of the email activity and what information may have been affected. With the assistance of third-party forensic investigators, we learned that certain Stow employee email accounts were accessed without authorization between August 25, 2019, and September 3, 2019, and September 16, 2019, and October 3, 2019.

Unfortunately, the investigators were unable to confirm what, if any, emails and attachments within these accounts were subject to unauthorized access. Therefore, working with third-party experts, we undertook a lengthy review of the email accounts to determine if they contained personal information and received a data file of potentially impacted individuals on December 2, 2019. However, this data file lacked complete address information related to individuals and required additional internal work to de-duplicate and update. We then commenced a review of this data file to add the missing address information and remove duplicate entries. Following this additional review, we determined that information related to you was accessible in the email accounts during the period of potential compromise. We are unable to confirm if the email or attachment hosting your information was subject to unauthorized access.

What Information Was Involved?

Stow cannot confirm what emails and attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized actor. However, Stow's investigation confirmed the information about you present in the email accounts at the time of the incident includes your <<b2b_text_1(ImpactedData)>>.

What We Are Doing.

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. Stow has strict security measures in place to safeguard information in our care. Upon learning of this incident, Stow took steps to confirm and further strengthen the security of our systems, including our employee email accounts. Stow reset passwords for the impacted Stow email accounts and is currently reviewing our policies and procedures relating to data security.

While we have no evidence of actual misuse of your personal information, we secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring services at no cost to you for one (1) year. Information on how to activate these services may be found in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Against Identity Theft and Fraud.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

The City of Los Banos takes the privacy and protection of personal information seriously. We are committed to notifying individuals if we believe the security or privacy of their information may have been compromised. We are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

We recently learned that a city-owned laptop containing personal information was stolen from an employee's vehicle. While the laptop was password protected, its contents were unencrypted, and therefore it is possible that someone would be able to remove the data from the hard drive. We think this is unlikely, but wanted to notify you of the incident nonetheless.

Upon discovering the incident, the City launched an investigation and recreated the contents of the laptop. The data that would have been on the laptop was then reviewed to identify individuals whose personal information may have been contained in those files. On December 14, 2019, we determined that some of your personal information was stored on the laptop.

At this point, we are not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a result of this incident, and do not know if any personal information was ever actually viewed or acquired by the unauthorized party. Although we are not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of Experian IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B.

For more information on identity theft prevention and IdentityWorks Credit 3B, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

As part of our investigation, we searched for any personal information that could have been viewed. The impacted information for each individual differs but included your name and Social Security number. The information also may have included your driver's license number and, for a small number of individuals, could have included one or more of the following: passport number, financial information such as account or credit/debit number, username and password, and biometric and/or medical information.

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes and steps to you can take to avoid identity theft. For more information and to contact the FTC, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You may also contact the FTC at: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. Alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies.

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies.

You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.

In order to request a security freeze, you may need to provide the following information:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security Number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.);
7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Relation Insurance, Inc. d/b/a Relation Insurance Services of Georgia, (Relation) located at 5825 Medlock Bridge Parkway, Suite 100, Johns Creek, Georgia 3002, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to seven (7) Maryland residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Relation does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Maryland law, the applicability of the Maryland data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

Relation provides insurance broker services to its business partners. On August 15, 2019, Relation became aware of unusual activity in an employee's email account. Relation immediately secured the employee's email account and launched an investigation, with the assistance of a third-party computer forensics investigator, to determine what may have happened and what information may have been affected. Relation's investigation determined that an unknown individual had access to the email account between August 14th and August 15th of 2019. Relation then undertook a comprehensive review of emails that were present in the account at the time of the incident to identify what personal information was stored within the emails and to whom that information relates. On October 16, 2019, Relation confirmed personal information was present in the email account and began reviewing its files to determine which business partners were associated with this information. On December 13, 2019, Relation provided notice of this incident to its business partners. The type of information in the account varied by potentially affected individual but included some combination of the following: date of birth, Social Security number, health insurance information, medical history, and mental or physical condition.

Notice to Maryland Residents

On or about January 30, 2020, Relation sent written notice via USPS of this incident on behalf of its business partners, to affected individuals, which include seven (7) Maryland residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering this incident, Relation moved quickly to investigate and respond to this event and assess the security of Relation's systems, including its employee email accounts. Relation also reviewed existing security policies and implemented additional security measures, including multi-factor authentication and additional employee training on data security. Relation reported this incident to law enforcement and is notifying appropriate state and federal regulators. Relation is also providing potentially impacted individuals with access to credit monitoring and identity protection services through Kroll. Additionally, Relation is providing potentially impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud. Relation is also providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Contact Information

Should you have any questions regarding this notification or other aspects of the data security event, please contact us at (267) 930-4775.

Very truly yours,

Christopher J. DiIenno of MULLEN COUGHLIN LLC

We are writing to inform you about a privacy issue that involves some of your health information. On December 10, 2019, UnitedHealthcare received information that an unauthorized individual may have gained access to some provider claims documents in a provider portal, which contained some of your health information.

This incident did not involve the disclosure of your Social Security number, driver's license number, or any personal financial account information.

Upon discovery, we took prompt action to investigate the matter and put additional protections in place to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the future. In addition, the company reported the incident to law enforcement and is working with them on the ongoing investigation.

February 3, 2020

Dear [name of person]:

We are writing to inform you of a recent security incident at Deaf Services Unlimited. This notification is sent pursuant to the Montana Data Breach Notification Statute (Montana Code 2-6-1501).

Between January 13, 2020 and January 24, 2020, Deaf Services Unlimited experienced an email phishing scam which resulted in a breach of our email system. The data accessed may have included personal information such as name, email address, mailing address, social security number, and bank account information.

To protect yourself from the possibility of identity theft, we recommend that you immediately place a fraud alert on your credit files. A fraud alert conveys a special message to anyone requesting your credit report that you suspect you were a victim of fraud. When you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, the lender should take measures to verify that you have authorized the request. A fraud alert should not stop you from using your existing credit cards or other accounts, but it may slow down your ability to get new credit. An initial fraud alert is valid for ninety (90) days. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies at the appropriate number listed below or via their website. One agency will notify the other two on your behalf. You will then receive letters from the agencies with instructions on how to obtain a free copy of your credit report from each.

Equifax (888)766-0008 or www.fraudalert.equifax.com
Experian (888) 397-3742 or www.experian.com
TransUnion (800) 680-7289 or www.transunion.com

You may also consider placing a Security Freeze on their credit reports. A Security Freeze prevents most potential creditors from viewing your credit reports and therefore, further restricts the opening of unauthorized accounts. For more information on placing a security freeze on your credit reports, please go to the Montana Attorney General website at https://dojmt.gov/consumer/identity-theft/.

When you receive a credit report from each agency, review the reports carefully. Look for accounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate, and confirm that your personal information, such as home address and Social Security number, is accurate. If you see anything you do not understand or recognize, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. You should also call your local police department and file a report of identity theft. Get and keep a copy of the police report because you may need to give copies to creditors to clear up your records or to access transaction records.

Even if you do not find signs of fraud on your credit reports, we recommend that you remain vigilant in reviewing your credit reports from the three major credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228 or by completing an Annual Credit Request Form at: www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/credit/rights.shtm and mailing to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 1025281 Atlanta, GA 30348-5283

Dear Valued Client,

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may involve your personal information.

On January 16, 2020, a hacking organization called Maze Ransomware infiltrated the central data server of our law firm, encrypted all of the files on the server, and made a demand for $150,000.00 in exchange for the decryption codes. At this time, despite reasonable efforts and the employment of a specialist, we are unable to ascertain the extent to which Maze may have actually extracted any personal data from any of our clients' files.

If Maze actually extracted data from our server, we must inform you that the following information may have been compromised: full names, mailing addresses, bank account numbers, social security numbers, dates of birth, phone numbers, drivers license numbers, medical/health insurance information, and any other sensitive information you may have provided our office during the course of your case with us. Fortunately, we do not store client billing information on our central server and, to our knowledge, none of our client billing or accounting information was accessed or disturbed.

We are conducting a thorough review of the potentially affected records and have reported the incident to local law enforcement and the Attorney General. We will notify you if there are any significant developments. We have also implemented additional security measures designed to prevent the recurrence of such an attack, and to protect the privacy of our clients moving forward.

We are notifying you so you can take action along with our efforts to minimize or eliminate potential harm. We encourage you to take preventive measures now to help prevent and detect any misuse of your information. As a first preventive step, we recommend you closely monitor your financial accounts and, if you see any unauthorized activity, promptly contact your financial institution and report any suspected identity theft to law enforcement, including the Attorney General online at https://www.doj.state.or.us/consumer-protection/ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by calling 1-877-438-4338 or online at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/.

As a second step, you also may want to contact the three U.S. credit reporting agencies (Equifax (1-888-836-6351), Experian (1-888-397-3742), and TransUnion (1-800-680-7289)) or obtain a free credit report from each by calling 1-877-322-8228 or by logging onto www.annualcreditreport.com. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the FTC recommends that you check your credit reports periodically.

We sincerely apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience it may cause you. Should you have questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at (541) 494-0913.

HOW TO ENROLL IN CREDIT MONITORING:

We have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online three-bureau credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for two years provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies.

To enroll in this service, go to the myTrueIdentity website at www.mytrueidentity.com and enter the following unique 12-letter Activation Code in the space referenced as "Enter Activation Code." Follow the three steps to receive your credit monitoring service online within minutes.

If you do not have access to the Internet and wish to enroll in a similar offline, paper-based credit monitoring service via U.S. Mail delivery, please call the TransUnion Fraud Response Services toll-free hotline at 1-855-288-5422. When prompted, enter the following 6-digit telephone passcode and follow the steps to enroll in the offline credit monitoring service, add an initial fraud alert to your credit file, or speak to a TransUnion representative if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft.

Once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain two years of unlimited access to your TransUnion credit report and credit score. The three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address, and more. The service also includes access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (Policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

You can sign up for the online or offline credit monitoring service anytime between now and May 31, 2020. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. Please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with TransUnion, Experian, or Equifax, or an address in the United States (or its territories) and a valid Social Security number. Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR MINORS AFFECTED BY THIS INCIDENT:

The same services referred to above may not be available to affected minors. As an alternative, parents/legal guardians can check to see if your child may be a victim of identity theft by using TransUnion's secure online form at www.transunion.com/childidentitytheft to submit your information so TransUnion can check their database for a credit file with your child's Social Security number. After TransUnion's search is complete, they will respond to you at the email address you provide. If they locate a file in your child's name, they will ask you for additional information to proceed with steps to protect your child from any impact associated with this fraudulent activity.

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:

You should remain vigilant for instances of fraud or identity theft over the next 12 to 24 months by reviewing your account statements and closely monitoring your credit reports, which are available to you free of charge.

Annual Credit Report: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. To order your free annual credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You can also order your free annual credit report by mailing a completed Annual Credit Report Request Form (available from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

For Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and Vermont residents: You may obtain one or more (depending on the state) additional copies of your credit report, free of charge. You must contact each of the credit reporting agencies directly to obtain such additional report(s).

Fraud Alert: You may place a fraud alert in your file by contacting one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you before they open any new accounts or make certain changes to your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit.

Security Freeze: You have the ability to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze will prevent a credit reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. To place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the credit reporting agency certain identifying information, including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement. Under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, you have the right to place a security freeze on your account free of charge.

On November 5, 2019, ICCU discovered suspicious activity related to a third-party mortgage portal
utilized by its employees. ICCU immediately launched an investigation, with the support of third-party forensic investigators,
to determine the nature and scope of the activity. On November 8, 2019, ICCU determined that there was unauthorized
access to the portal. ICCU undertook a lengthy and labor-intensive process to identify the personal information contained
within the affected portal. ICCU is notifying you because we have confirmed that your information was present in the
affected portal. Please note that the information affected by this incident was stored on the third-party mortgage portal and
not on ICCUâ€™s systems. & On January 17, 2020, ICCUâ€™s investigation determined that the following information
related to you was present in the affected portal: <<ClientDef1(Impacted Data)>>. Your address information may have also
been present in the affected portal.	The information suggests that there was unauthorized access gained to the third-party mortgage portal, pointing towards an external party hacking the system.
On October 19, 2019, JDC became aware of suspicious activity related to a JDC email account. Upon 
discovery, JDC immediately launched an investigation, with the aid of forensic investigators, to determine the nature and 
scope of the activity. On December 10, 2019, JDCâ€™s investigation determined that there was unauthorized access to 
the JDC email account between July 21, 2019 and August 26, 2019, which contained certain information related to you. 
Although JDC has no evidence of actual access or misuse of information as a result of this incident, JDC is notifying 
you in an abundance of caution because we have confirmed that certain information relating to you was present in the 
affected email account.& JDC determined that the following information related to you was present in the 
affected email account at the time of this incident: <<b2b_text_3 (Impacted Data)>>. Your Social Security number was

On December 9, 2019, Overlake learned of an email compromise, or phishing incident, that
resulted in the unauthorized access to employee email accounts between December 6, 2019 and
December 9, 2019. Overlake immediately secured the accounts and began an investigation, and a
cyber security firm was engaged to assist. Through its investigation, Overlake determined that an
unauthorized party may have been able to access patient information contained in the email
accounts. & Overlake determined that these emails may have included information belonging to
1,087 California residents, including some or all of the following data elements: demographic
information, health insurance information, and limited clinical information.	The unauthorized access to employee email accounts implies that an outside party hacked into the system to access patient information.
broken link & broken link	There is not enough information to determine the type of breach.
On December 9, 2019, we learned that unidentified third parties obtained the login credentials of one Overlake email
account. The third parties acquired the credentials by sending a deceptive email to Overlakeâ€™s staff members asking
them to enter the username and password of their Overlake account on a web page that was linked in the emails. This
type of cybersecurity incident is commonly known as a â€œphishingâ€ scam. & The third parties then used the credentials of
the one email account to send a second series of phishing emails to Overlake staff members in another attempt to obtain
additional account usernames and passwords.	Based on the information provided, the breach was the result of the email account being hacked by an outside party who acquired login credentials through a phishing scam.

We are writing to inform you of a recent security incident that may have affected your health information that is maintained by Overlake Medical Center & Clinics. On December 9, 2019, we discovered that unidentified third parties obtained the login credentials of one Overlake email account through a phishing scam. The third parties then used the credentials to send a second series of phishing emails to Overlake staff members in an attempt to obtain additional account usernames and passwords. We secured the accounts within hours and immediately began an investigation. Our investigation determined that the third parties had access to the initially affected account from December 6 to 9, 2019, and the subsequently affected email accounts for just a few hours on December 9, 2019.

Although our investigation is ongoing, we cannot rule out that the third parties accessed specific information stored in the email accounts, which may have included your demographic information (such as full name, date of birth, phone number, and address), health insurance information (such as name of insurer or insurance ID number), and certain health information (such as diagnosis and treatment information) related to the care you received at Overlake. We have no evidence that your Social Security number or driver's license number was contained in the email accounts. However, if we find that your Social Security number or driver's license number was included in the email accounts, we will send you another letter with an offer of free credit monitoring and identity protection services.

We recommend that you carefully review the statements you receive from your healthcare providers and health insurers. If you see services you did not receive, please contact the provider or insurer immediately. We have implemented additional security measures to protect our systems and help prevent similar situations from happening in the future. Specific actions include resetting passwords for all compromised employee accounts, enhancing employee education to help them better recognize and avoid phishing emails, enhancing the technology in use to identify and block suspicious external emails, and implementing multi-factor authentication.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: On December 9, 2019, Overlake Medical Center & Clinics discovered that an email compromise or phishing incident had occurred, which resulted in unauthorized access to employee email accounts between December 6, 2019, and December 9, 2019. Overlake secured the accounts immediately and began an investigation, engaging a cybersecurity firm to assist. During the investigation, Overlake discovered that an unauthorized party may have accessed patient information contained in the email accounts. The emails may have included information belonging to 454 Oregon residents, including demographic information, health insurance information, and limited clinical information. On February 4, 2020, Overlake sent notification letters to affected individuals in compliance with O.R.S. 646A.604.1. Overlake also established a dedicated call center where affected individuals could obtain more information regarding the incident.

The notification letter informs the affected individuals that unidentified third parties obtained the login credentials of one Overlake email account on December 9, 2019, by sending a deceptive email to Overlake staff members asking them to enter the username and password of their Overlake account on a web page that was linked in the emails. The third parties then used the credentials of the one email account to send a second series of phishing emails to Overlake staff members in another attempt to obtain additional account usernames and passwords. The investigation determined that the third parties had access to the initially affected account from December 6, 2019, to December 9, 2019, and the subsequently affected email accounts for just a few hours on December 9, 2019. The investigation cannot rule out that the third parties accessed specific information stored in the email accounts, which may have included demographic information, health insurance information, and certain health information related to the care received at Overlake.

The letter assures the affected individuals that Overlake has implemented additional security measures to protect its systems and prevent similar situations from happening in the future. These measures include resetting passwords for all compromised employee accounts to prevent further unauthorized access, enhancing mandatory education for employees to help them better recognize and avoid phishing emails, enhancing the technology in use to identify and block suspicious external emails, and implementing multi-factor authentication, which requires staff to go through multiple steps to verify their identity to access systems.

The letter recommends that affected individuals carefully review the statements they receive from their healthcare providers and health insurers and contact the provider or insurer immediately if they see services they did not receive. The letter also provides a dedicated and confidential toll-free helpline at 1-844-902-2033, which affected individuals can contact for further questions.

The letter is signed by Lisa Brock, Chief Compliance Officer, Overlake Medical Center & Clinics, and includes the date, ELN-????-?????, and the address of the affected individual.	The breach was caused by an email compromise or phishing incident that resulted in unauthorized access to employee email accounts.

What Happened?
February 12, 2020
Recently, you submitted a dispute with respect to one or more suspected fraudulent ATM transactions and, in
connection with BBVA's processing of your dispute claim, your debit card was blocked and reissued. BBVA's
continuing investigation into this matter leads us to believe that your debit card information may have been
compromised due to criminal activity impacting a small number of the bank's ATMs. The precise time period
during which the incident occurred is still under investigation, but initial evidence indicates that the criminal
activity may have commenced in mid-November 2019 and ended no later than January 14, 2020. During this
time, our investigation has determined that these criminal actors accessed the personal information of a limited
number of customers. We sincerely apologize for this incident and for any concern this matter may cause you. & What Information Was Involved?
The information that was accessed may have included your debit card number, the debit card expiration date,
the debit card CVV security code, your personal identifier number (PIN), and the name associated with the debit
card. Based upon our investigation to date, none of your other personal information-including your Social
Security number, driver's license number, etc.-was compromised during this incident.	The breach involved compromised debit card information, which was used for fraudulent ATM transactions. It was not a hack or an insider attack, and there is no indication that any physical documents were lost or stolen. It also does not involve any unintentional disclosure or portable device, making it a CARD breach.

	The breach was caused by an outside actor who gained access to certain employee email accounts through suspicious activity between July 9, 2019 and August 24, 2019.
What Happened
On December 7, 2019, BST learned that part of our network was infected with a virus that prohibited access to our
files. We quickly restored our systems and engaged an industry-leading forensic investigation firm to determine
the nature and scope of this incident. After a thorough analysis of all available forensic evidence, the investigation
determined the virus was active on our network from December 4, 2019, to December 7, 2019. We determined that
the virus was introduced by an unknown individual or individuals outside our organization who gained access to part
of our network where we store some client files, including files from CCP.
Because there was a risk that CCPâ€™s data may have been accessed, acquired, or otherwise disclosed without authorization
from BSTâ€™s network, we reviewed all CCP data to determine whether it included personal information. The review, after
addition of contact information, was completed on February 5, 2020, and revealed some of the potentially accessed CCP
files contained protected health information for certain individuals, including you. You may be wondering why we had
your information in the first place. As part of our work for CCP, we review financial documents that may contain patient
information such as names, account numbers, dates of birth, and medical billing codes.
The forensic investigation could not conclude that any of your protected health information was accessed or acquired
by an unauthorized individual. However, in an abundance of caution, we are providing you with notice of the possible
unauthorized disclosure and one (1) year of identity monitoring at no cost to you to allow you to take steps to protect
your personal information, if you feel it is appropriate to do so. & What Information Was Involved
BST is unable to confirm whether your information was actually obtained by an unauthorized individual. Our
investigation determined that as a result of this incident, some of your protected health information may have been
accessed or acquired without authorization, including your first and last name, <<Data Elements1-Affected Info>>.
This information appeared incidentally on CCP balance statements that were provided to us in order for BST to
provide accounting services to CCP. BST does not use your information in connection with any other purpose. Your
medical records and Social Security number were not impacted by this incident. We do not possess such information
because CCP does not share that information with us.	Based on the information provided, there was a virus that infected the organization's network and an outside individual or individuals gained unauthorized access to part of their network where they store client files. This indicates a hacking incident.
On or around June 14, 2019, NCH became aware of suspicious activity related to our human
resources, timekeeping, and payroll system. We immediately launched an investigation into this suspicious
activity and determined that certain employees fell victim to an email phishing scheme that allowed an
unauthorized actor (hacker) to gain access to the employee's payroll records as well as their email accounts.
Importantly, NCH patient medical record systems were not affected by this incident, and the sole purpose of the
attack appears to have been to reroute direct deposit payroll funds; however, the stolen credentials allowed access
to employee email accounts. Third party specialists undertook a diligent and time-consuming manual and
programmatic review of the entire contents of the relevant email accounts to determine what data was present as
the investigation was not able to determine if any email was actually viewed. On December 19, 2019, the review
provided confirmation of the identities of those individuals who may have had information present within the
email accounts under review.
Our investigation determined the following info1mation may have been
accessible: <<data elements>>. & <<data elements>> (censored)	The unauthorized access to the employee's payroll records and email accounts suggests that this was a hack by an outside party using an email phishing scheme.

Nature of the Data Breach

Beginning on August 24, 2019, Aveanna became aware of suspicious activity relating to a number of its employee email accounts. Aveanna took steps to secure the email accounts and began working with outside computer forensics specialists to determine the nature and scope of the activity. The investigation determined that an unknown actor accessed certain employee email accounts between July 9, 2019 and August 24, 2019. Unfortunately, the investigation did not reveal if any email or attachment was actually accessed or viewed.

Once this exhaustive review was complete, we next worked diligently to confirm the identity of the impacted individuals to whom that information related and their address. The investigation recently concluded, and Aveanna is providing notice to individuals whose personal information may have been accessible.

Although the type of personal information potentially impacted may vary by individuals, Aveanna confirmed that the following types of personal information relating to five thousand and four (5,004) California residents were present within impacted email accounts: Social Security number, drivers license or state ID, bank or financial account information, medical information, and health insurance information.

Aveanna identified the individuals who may be affected by the incident, put resources in place to assist them, and provided them with notice. Aveanna is providing all potentially affected individuals with complimentary access to twelve (12) months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through TransUnion.

Additionally, Aveanna is providing potentially impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

While Aveanna had security measures in place to protect information in its care, it also took steps to implement additional safeguards and review company policies and procedures in order to ensure it protects the security of information on its systems. Specifically, Aveanna immediately changed the credentials for the involved email accounts and has since implemented additional security measures for employee email accounts and access to company systems including multi-factor authentication.

Aveanna is providing notice of this incident to other state and federal regulators and the three major credit reporting agencies, as required.

TOA takes the privacy and security of patient information very seriously and deeply regrets any concern that this incident may cause. We are writing to notify you of this incident and to inform you about steps that can be taken to help protect your information.

What Happened?

On October 18, 2019, TOA discovered unusual activity in an employee's email account. TOA immediately took steps to secure its email system and launched an investigation with the assistance of a leading digital forensics firm to determine whether additional email accounts may have been impacted and whether any personal information was accessed or acquired without authorization. Through this investigation, TOA learned that an email account belonging to a second employee may have been impacted as well. The two email accounts were subject to authorized access by an unknown party between August 16 and October 14, 2019. On January 3, 2020, our investigation determined that your information was contained in the impacted accounts and therefore may have been viewed or accessed without authorization, though the investigation could not conclude definitively whether your information was actually accessed or acquired. TOA then worked to identify up-to-date address information required to notify potentially impacted individuals.

Please note that this incident was limited to information transmitted via email and did not affect any other information systems. Moreover, we have no evidence to suggest your personal information has been misused. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, TOA is notifying you of this incident and providing you with information about steps you can take to help protect your information.

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Aveanna Healthcare (Aveanna), 400 Interstate North Parkway SE, Suite 1600, Atlanta, GA 30339. We write to notify you of a recent incident that may affect the security of the personal information of two thousand four hundred and forty-four (2,444) Washington residents. By providing this notice, Aveanna does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Washington law or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

Beginning on August 24, 2019, Aveanna became aware of suspicious activity relating to a number of its employee email accounts. Aveanna took steps to secure the email accounts and began working with outside computer forensics specialists to determine the nature and scope of the activity. The investigation determined that an unknown actor accessed certain employee email accounts between July 9, 2019 and August 24, 2019. Unfortunately, the investigation did not reveal if any email or attachment was actually accessed or viewed. In an abundance of caution and with the assistance of third-party specialists, a comprehensive review of the contents of the impacted email accounts was performed to identify any personal information that could have potentially been viewed or acquired by the intruder. Once this exhaustive review was complete, we next worked diligently to confirm the identity of the impacted individuals to whom that information related and their address. The investigation recently concluded, and Aveanna is providing notice to individuals whose personal information may have been accessible.

Although the type of personal information potentially impacted may vary by individuals, Aveanna confirmed that the following types of personal information relating to two thousand four hundred and forty-four (2,444) Washington residents were present within impacted email accounts: Social Security number, drivers license or state ID, and bank or financial account number.

Notice to Washington Residents

Aveanna began mailing written notice to potentially affected individuals, which includes two thousand four hundred and forty-four (2,444) Washington residents, on or about February 14, 2020. Notice was provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and to Be Taken

Upon discovering the incident, Aveanna moved quickly to determine its nature and scope. Aveanna identified the individuals who may be affected by the incident, put resources in place to assist them, and provided them with notice. Aveanna is providing all potentially affected individuals with complimentary access to twelve (12) months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through TransUnion. Additionally, Aveanna is providing potentially impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

While Aveanna had security measures in place to protect information in its care, it also took steps to implement additional safeguards and review company policies and procedures in order to ensure it protects the security of information on its systems. Specifically, Aveanna immediately changed the credentials for the involved email accounts and has since implemented additional security measures for employee email accounts and access to company systems including multi-factor authentication. Aveanna is providing notice of this incident to other state and federal regulators, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the three major credit reporting agencies, as required.

Contact Information

Should you have any questions regarding this notification or other aspects of the data security event, please contact us at 267-930-4786.

Very truly yours,

For team members who currently work or formerly worked at a Wisconsin location, the information includes the team members Social Security number, the bank account used for direct deposit, birth date and home address.

What Are We Doing?

Dear [NAME],

We regret to inform you of a security incident involving information related to a reservation you made for a hotel you booked on Tablet. This incident resulted in unauthorized access to the name, payment card details, and billing address that you used to make the reservation. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

An unauthorized third party accessed an online portal through which we made payment card information available to hotels so that the hotels could add that information to their property management systems. The payment card information is available through the portal only for a brief period long enough for the hotel to retrieve it after which the information is no longer accessible through the portal. An internal investigation that followed the discovery of the incident identified and addressed the incident's cause.

The reservation information involved was your name, billing address, payment card number, expiration date, and verification code. Specifically, this relates to reservation number [NUMBER] you made using a card ending in [LAST 4 DIGITS]. Please note that your email address and Tablet password were not affected by this incident.

We have taken steps to review and update our security measures as a result of this incident, as part of our continuous evaluation of the information security measures we have in place. This ongoing effort is part of our commitment to take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. Finally, law enforcement has been notified of the incident.

Out of an abundance of caution, we have arranged for you to receive identity protection and credit monitoring services for one year at no cost to you. For more information about these services and instructions on completing the enrollment process, please refer to the enrollment instructions included in the attached Reference Guide.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Experian PO Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com/freeze/center.html

Equifax PO Box 105788 Atlanta, GA 30348-5788 1-800-685-1111 www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services

To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.);
7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant and review your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC).

Copy of Credit Report:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you, including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

As a result, Endeavor maintains records with the personal information of <<Affiliate Shorthand>>'s current and former employees and their family members who received benefits through <<Affiliate Shorthand>>. Endeavor is committed to protecting this personal information. Unfortunately, we are writing to inform you of an information security incident that could potentially affect you and to share with you the steps that Endeavor is taking to address it.

On January 14, 2020, Endeavor learned that an employee with human resources and benefits responsibilities had been the subject of a phishing scam that may have resulted in an unauthorized person gaining access to that employee's Endeavor Office 365 e-mail account. Endeavor immediately began investigating the incident and retained a third-party review company to help determine the information that may have been accessed by the unauthorized person. Endeavor discovered on February 7, 2020, the day after the document review company provided its final report, that this unauthorized person may have gained access to your personal information, including your name and Social Security number. Please note that we have no information indicating that your personal information was actually taken or has been misused, but the possibility exists. We also want to emphasize that the unauthorized person did not have access to any of your other sensitive information, such as your driver's license number, payment card information number, or information that would permit access to any financial account.

Endeavor takes seriously both the security of your personal information and this incident. Immediately upon learning of the incident, Endeavor began its investigation in an effort to determine what, if any, personal information might have been accessed. We retained an outside law firm and other third-party incident response providers to assist with the investigation and the incident response. Since learning of the incident, we have worked diligently and expeditiously with our incident response providers to conduct a thorough and comprehensive investigation of the incident, to identify and provide an appropriate identity protection product to you, and to establish a call center with trained representatives to answer your questions. We also have reported this incident to law enforcement and will cooperate with any investigation.

Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, Endeavor is providing you with one year of identity protection services at no cost to you. By enrolling in MyIDCare, through Endeavor's identity protection provider, ID Experts, you will receive a wide range of benefits, including credit monitoring, Internet and Dark Web scanning, identity restoration services, and $1 million in identity theft insurance. Please note that if you are under the age of 18, you will not be eligible for benefits related to credit monitoring because minors do not have a credit report.

To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report from one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

3. Review your account statements. You should carefully review for suspicious activity the statements that you receive from credit card companies, banks, utilities, and other service providers.

4. Remain vigilant and respond to suspicious activity. If you receive an e-mail or mail alert from ID Experts, contact a MyIDCare identity resolution agent toll-free at (833) 554-0464 or visit https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect for additional information. You should consider changing your username, passwords, security questions, and security answers to your online accounts. If you notice suspicious activity on an account statement, report it to your credit card company or service provider and consider closing the account. You should also consider reporting such activity to Endeavor, your local police department, your state's attorney general, and the Federal Trade Commission.

5. You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit file without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.

A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.

To place a security freeze on your credit file, contact the three nationwide credit bureaus, listed below.	An employee was the subject of a phishing scam resulting in a third-party possibly gaining access to the employee's email account, potentially affecting the personal information of current and former employees and their family members who received benefits through the company.

At Frobenius, Conaway & Company, P.C., we understand the importance of protecting the personal information in our possession. We are writing to inform you of a recent security incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

Our ongoing investigation into an email phishing incident recently determined that an unauthorized party could have accessed emails with potentially sensitive information in a single employee email account. Upon learning of the potential access, we took steps to secure the email account and began an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized party accessed the account between September 23, 2019, and October 21, 2019. The investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized person. Out of an abundance of caution, we conducted a comprehensive review of the emails and attachments in the account and determined on January 15, 2020, that an email or attachment contained your <<b2b_text_1(Impacted Data)>><<b2b_text_2(Impacted Data)>>.

Although, to date, we have no evidence that your information has been misused, we assure you that we take this incident very seriously. We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously, which is why we are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the data security incident.

After a thorough analysis of all available forensic evidence, we determined that a virus was active on our network from December 4, 2019 to December 7, 2019. The virus was introduced by an unknown individual or individuals outside our organization who gained access to part of our network where we store certain information. We reviewed the information to determine whether it included personal information and concluded that some of your personal information may have been accessed and acquired by an unauthorized individual.

The forensic investigation could not conclude that any of your personal information was accessed or acquired by an unauthorized individual. However, in an abundance of caution, we are providing you with notice of the possible unauthorized disclosure and one (1) year of identity monitoring at no cost to you to allow you to take steps to protect your personal information, if you feel it is appropriate to do so.

We encourage you to review the enclosed Additional Resources information included with this letter, which describes additional steps you can take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft.

Re: Data Security Incident Update

Dear Attorney General Ferguson,

On behalf of The UPS Store, Inc. (TUPSS), and as a supplement to our January 20, 2020 letter, we write to advise you that we have completed our internal review of the subject incident.

Since our January 20 letter, we have found personal information in the potentially affected accounts associated with what appear to be an additional 87 residents. We currently are unaware of fraud or misuse concerning their personal information. As a precaution, we are notifying this Office and the individual state residents and providing the residents with complimentary credit monitoring and identify theft restoration services from Experian for 24 months. We also have established a call center to answer consumer questions.

An unaddressed copy of the individual notification letter, which will be mailed on February 21, 2020, is attached as	Based on the description of the breach notification letter, there is no indication that the data breach involved hacking, an insider, physical documents, portable devices, or stationary computers. Instead, the breach was the result of personal information being exposed through unintended disclosure, which is classified as unintentional disclosure not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss.
We received a report on January 23, 2020 that data may have been exported by an unauthorized actor from an Anthem
associateâ€™s email account on December 11, 2019. The unauthorized actor was able to export a small amount of data
through malware, a type of malicious software. Anthem promptly quarantined the computer and eliminated the malware,
however some data was taken by the unauthorized actor. If you are part of a self-insured group health plan, please note
we have notified your group health plan and are notifying you on the planâ€™s behalf as your information was involved. & The following information may have been included: first name, last name, eligibility information, information related to
healthcare services, ID number, and, in some cases, social security number.	The breach involved an unauthorized actor who was able to export data through malware, which is a type of malicious software.
Lancaster Archery Supply recently became aware of unusual activity on our e-commerce websites. 
Specifically, on or about January 10, 2020, Lancaster Archery Supply discovered unauthorized malicious code 
on our e-commerce websites. We immediately began an investigation, with the assistance of third-party forensic 
investigators, and removed the malicious code from our websites. On January 28, 2020, upon completion of a 
thorough investigation, we determined that certain payment card information used at www.lancasterarchery.com and 
www.lancasterarcherydealer.com between December 9, 2019, and January 10, 2020, could have been accessed by 
an unauthorized third party. It appears that this malicious code was inserted following an event with our third-party 
developer. We no longer work with this organization. 
& The investigation determined that the malicious code was capable of collecting 
certain payment card information, including the cardholderâ€™s name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, 
and CVV for payment cards used at www.lancasterarchery.com and www.lancasterarcherydealer.com between 
December 9, 2019, and January 10, 2020. This event only impacts credit card information entered online during this 
window. Lancaster Archery does not store credit card numbers.	The breach involved unauthorized access to payment card information on Lancaster Archery's e-commerce websites.
On January 3, 2020, we learned of a data security incident that involved radiology-related patient
information. Upon learning of the incident, we secured the affected information and launched an immediate investigation.
We learned that, between the dates of June 20, 2019 and January 3, 2020, some information for a limited number of patients
was accessed without authorization via an Internet port. On February 5, 2020, our investigation determined that your
information may have been involved. & The information that was involved is listed below but did NOT include Social Security
numbers, credit card numbers, radiology images, radiology reports, or diagnoses. Instead, the patient information included
patient name, gender, and type and date of imaging studies. In some instances, the patient information also included one
or more of the following types of information: date of birth, medical record number, description of the imaging study, and the
referring physicianâ€™s name.	The data security incident involved unauthorized access via an Internet port, indicating that the breach was caused by a third-party hacker or malware.
We recently learned that an unauthorized party may have obtained access to a Steele County employee email account between September 17, 2019 and October 10, 2019.	The unauthorized party gaining access to the employee email account indicates that the breach was caused by an outside party accessing the system.

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident involving patient health information. On January 3, 2020, we learned that radiology-related patient information was accessed without authorization between June 20, 2019 and January 3, 2020, via an Internet port. We immediately secured the affected information and launched an investigation. On February 5, 2020, we determined that your information may have been involved.

The information that was involved did not include Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, radiology images, radiology reports, or diagnoses. Instead, it included patient name, gender, and type and date of imaging studies.

Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at (833) 554-0513 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069
Atlanta, GA 30348-5069
www.equifax.com

Experian Fraud Reporting
1-888-397-3742
P.O. Box 9554

TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit	This breach was categorized as HACK as the institution's email accounts were hacked by an unauthorized user.

Other Important Information

1. Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File
We recommend that you place an initial 1-year fraud alert on your credit files, at no charge. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you personally before they open any new accounts. To place a fraud alert, call any one of the three major credit bureaus at the numbers listed below. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, they will notify the others.

Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian: 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion LLC: 1-800-680-7289

2. Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File
If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a security freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by sending a request in writing or by mail, to all three nationwide credit reporting companies. To find out more about how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information:

Equifax Security Freeze: https://www.freeze.equifax.com or 1-800-685-1111
Experian Security Freeze: http://experian.com/freeze or 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion Security Freeze: http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze or 1-888-909-8872

In order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit monitoring company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name, or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the city in which you currently reside.

3. Obtaining a Free Credit Report
Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

4. Accessing Additional Helpful Resources
Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many creditors will want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint with the FTC by contacting them on the web at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338), or by mail at Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

If this notice letter states that your financial account number was impacted, we recommend that you contact your financial institution to inquire about steps to take to protect your account, including whether you should close your account or obtain a new account number.

Iowa Residents: You may contact law enforcement or the Iowa Attorney General's Office to report suspected incidents of identity theft: Office of the Attorney General of Iowa, Consumer Protection Division, Hoover State Office Building, 1305 East Walnut Street, Des Moines, IA 50319, www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov, Telephone: (515) 281-5164.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

MediaRadar is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have affected the security of some of your personal information. We want to provide you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against possible misuse of your personal information, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On November 4, 2019, MediaRadar became aware of unusual activity on its network. We conducted an immediate investigation and soon determined that the network was impacted by ransomware. In response, we worked with third-party forensics experts to investigate the nature and scope of this activity. The investigation determined that while there was no evidence that MediaRadar's employee information was accessed during this event, that type of activity cannot be ruled out with certainty. This ransomware is typically used by unauthorized individuals to programmatically encrypt data. However, we are providing you with this notice in an abundance of caution. MediaRadar performed a thorough review of the information contained within its network, and on November 26, 2019, MediaRadar determined the identities of the individuals whose information may have been included in the potentially accessible files. MediaRadar continued to work to obtain contact information for all impacted individuals through February 7, 2020.

What Information was Involved?

The investigation determined that your <<b2b_text_1 (personal data)>> may have been accessible by the unauthorized actor. To date, MediaRadar has not received any reports of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this event.

What We Are Doing.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information within our care are among MediaRadar's highest priorities. Upon becoming aware of the event, MediaRadar moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of MediaRadar's systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. In response to this event, MediaRadar implemented more sophisticated security training, including conducting employee phishing email testing. Additionally, MediaRadar held a company-wide meeting to educate employees regarding best practices relating to data security. MediaRadar also implemented additional safeguards, such as network-wide password changes, and network and server scans by third-party security specialists.

What You Can Do.

Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Against Identity Theft and Fraud, which contains information on what you can do to better protect against possible misuse of your information.

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;

In 2017, the AFTRA Health Fund merged with the SAG - Producers Health Plan to form the SAG-AFTRA Health Plan. For a period of time following the merger, AFTRA Retirement supported the Health Plan as a business associate. On October 28, 2019, AFTRA received an alert of suspicious activity in its environment. AFTRA immediately launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the incident. As part of the investigation, which was conducted with the assistance of a third-party forensic expert, it was determined that certain files and folders on AFTRA's network may have been subject to unauthorized access for periods of time between October 24, 2019, and October 28, 2019. At this time, AFTRA does not have evidence that files containing sensitive information were accessed; however, access to these files could not be ruled out. AFTRA therefore undertook a time-consuming review of all the files and folders that may have been accessed to determine what sensitive information they may contain. The information that was potentially subject to unauthorized access includes name, Social Security number, AFTRA number, date of birth, date of death, address, and past information about eligibility, dependent(s), claims, earnings, contributions, and beneficiaries. The data impacted varied by individual. AFTRA is providing individuals whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident with access to credit monitoring services for one year through Kroll, at no cost to these individuals. Additionally, AFTRA is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud. AFTRA is also providing notice to other regulators	Based on the information provided, it appears that the AFTRA Retirement Fund experienced unauthorized access to their network files and folders, with evidence of suspicious activity in their environment. The investigation was conducted with the assistance of a third-party forensic expert and it was determined that certain files and folders may have been subject to unauthorized access for a certain period of time. Although it is not clear whether sensitive information was accessed, access to these files could not be ruled out.

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift, or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

- Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);

Recommended Steps To Help Protect Your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect; and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-833-554-0514 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting 1-866-349-5191 P.O. Box 105069 Atlanta, GA 30348-5069 www.alerts.equifax.com
Experian Fraud Reporting 1-888-397-3742 P.O. Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com
TransUnion Fraud Reporting 1-800-680-7289 P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19022-2000 www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift	This breach was due to inadvertent disclosure and not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss. UltiPro by Ultimate Software Group, Inc. accidentally sent an email containing personal information to the wrong recipient. Although there was no evidence of misuse of personal information, the company provided identity protection services to reduce the chances of identity theft or fraud on accounts.

Our investigation determined that an internal application error allowed certain personal messages from Walgreens that are stored in a database to be viewable by other customers using the Walgreens mobile app. Once we learned of the incident, Walgreens promptly took steps to temporarily disable message viewing to prevent further disclosure and then implemented a technical correction that resolved the issue.

As part of our investigation, Walgreens determined that certain messages containing limited health-related information were involved in this incident for a small percentage of impacted customers. We believe that you were part of the impacted customer group and that one or more personal messages containing your limited health-related information may have been viewed by another customer on the Walgreens mobile app between January 9, 2020, and January 15, 2020.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED

Our investigation determined the following information might have been viewed by another customer:

No financial information such as Social Security number or bank account information was involved in this incident.

WHAT ARE WE DOING

Even though no financial information was involved in this incident, any time you detect suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, or the Federal Trade Commission. In some states, you may also obtain a police report regarding this incident.

Obtain and Monitor Your Credit Report. You have the right to obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the 3 major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit Report. You may consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. This fraud alert statement informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Other Important Information

Security Freeze. In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. A security freeze (also known as a credit freeze) makes it harder for someone to open a new account in your name. It is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to apply for a new credit card, cell phone, or any service that requires a credit check. Additionally, if you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency there may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift, or remove the security freeze; however, this fee may be less in certain states (in MA, up to $5). In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency referenced above.

Take Advantage of Additional Free Resources on Identity Theft. In addition to credit reporting agencies, you can also contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about fraud alerts and security freezes, as well as how to avoid identity theft. The FTC identity theft hotline number is: 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338); TTY: 1-866653-4261. They also provide information on-line at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, and their mailing address is 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. The FTC encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. You can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. Please note that in order to file a report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some proof that you have been a victim. Instances of known or suspected identity theft should also be reported to law enforcement and your state Attorney General. This notice has not been delayed by law enforcement.	The breach was an unintended disclosure not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss. Walgreens discovered that certain personal messages containing limited health-related information were involved in this incident and viewed by another customer on the Walgreens mobile app between January 9, 2020, and January 15, 2020, due to an internal application error that allowed certain messages from Walgreens that are stored in a database to be viewable by other customers.

The error was first recognized November 1, 2019, and we began an analysis to identify and correct the source of the problem. Your address was updated in our system on December 20, 2019. Correspondence mailed to your former address may have included appointment reminders, care reminders, surveys, referral letters, and Explanations of Benefits.

What Information Was Involved?

The information in the mailings included demographic information, such as your first and last name and former address and may have included medical information such as diagnosis or medication, billing information, and health insurance information. Your Social Security number and any credit card information were not included in the mailings. While we believe the risk is limited, there is a possibility that the information could be used inappropriately or further disclosed.

What We Are Doing:

After the error was discovered, we conducted an investigation, created a corrective action plan to correct your address, which occurred on December 20, 2019, and are developing training for staff to prevent this kind of error in the future. We have no indication to believe that the information is being used for fraud or other criminal activity. The department that sent you the original mail has re-sent it to you or will re-send it if determined necessary.

What You Can Do:

As always, we recommend that you review your health statements for accuracy and let us know if something does not look right. Kaiser Permanente respects your right to file a complaint. If you have any questions, concerns, or wish to file a complaint with us, please contact us at 1-800-464-4000, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (closed holidays). For TTY, call 711.

On January 31, 2020, we discovered that a stolen backup hard drive contained some patient information. The backup hard drive 
was taken along with other employee personal items. We immediately reported this incident to law enforcement and conducted 
an investigation to determine which patients may have had information on the hard drive that could have been viewed. 

& While we have no reason to believe that your information was the target of the theft, and the password-protected backup 
data file requires proprietary program software to be read, there were some supporting documents on the hard drive as well 
that could have been viewed. That information may have included treatment consent forms, referral letters, emails, and 
some X-ray images. Specifically, names, addresses, dates of birth, some healthcare information, and a limited number of 
Social Security numbers were viewable. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying all patients.	The breach occurred when a backup hard drive containing patient information was stolen along with other employee personal items. The physical device was lost, and it was not hacked by an outsider or breached by an insider. Therefore, this breach is classified as a PHYS breach.
On January 16, 2020, Granicus was informed that its online meeting and agenda management software 
used by its government clients to publish various publicly available documents was misconfigured to allow access to 
certain non-public files maintained within the application. Granicus immediately launched an internal investigation and 
review of its application settings to identify the cause of the error. Within 24 hours, Granicus detected the source of the 
issue and reconfigured the viewer permissions to remove access to any non-public files. Granicus then identified and 
segregated any non-public files which may have been inadvertently accessible as a result of the misconfiguration and 
conducted a thorough review of the identified files to determine whether any sensitive or personal information was 
contained therein.& he following information may have been contained within the identified files: your

The breach involved an unintended disclosure of non-public files due to misconfiguration, but there was no indication of hacking, insider involvement, physical loss, or device theft.

Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must be over the age of 18, have established credit in the U.S., have a Social Security number in your name, and have a U.S. residential address associated with your credit file. You will also need to have access to a computer to enroll and receive the benefits of these services.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-800-939-4170 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly.

You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069	The personal information was inadvertently disclosed due to a misconfigured storage folder in Granicus' online meeting and agenda management software. Granicus immediately took steps to remove access to any non-public files, segregated any affected files, and conducted a review to determine if there was any sensitive or personal information contained.

In addition, you may contact the FTC or your state attorney general to learn more about the steps you can take to protect yourself against identity theft.

Provided below are the names and contact information for the three major U.S. credit bureaus and additional information about steps you can take to obtain a free credit report and place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report. If you believe you are a victim of fraud or identity theft you should consider contacting your local law enforcement agency, your states attorney general, or the Federal Trade Commission. Please know that contacting us will not expedite any remediation of suspicious activity.

INFORMATION ON OBTAINING A FREE CREDIT REPORT

U.S. residents are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. To order your free credit reports, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at +1 (877) 726-1014.

INFORMATION ON IMPLEMENTING A FRAUD ALERT OR SECURITY FREEZE

Consider contacting the three major credit bureaus at the addresses below to place a fraud alert on your credit report. A fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. A fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit. Instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. Although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumers credit report without written authorization. However, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing or other services. A credit reporting agency may not charge you to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. To place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, you must contact the three credit bureaus below:

Equifax: Consumer Fraud Division P.O. Box 740256 Atlanta, GA 30374 +1 (888) 766-0008	An unsanctioned third party gained unauthorized access to some employee email accounts that contained personal information regarding guests. Between April 11 and July 23, 2019.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have impacted some of your personal information. We take the protection of our patients' information seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this incident may cause. This letter provides you with information concerning the incident as well as detailed information about steps we have taken to mitigate the effects of this incident.

What Happened?

On January 31, 2020, we discovered that a stolen backup hard drive contained some patient information. The backup hard drive was taken along with other employee personal items. We immediately reported this incident to law enforcement and conducted an investigation to determine which patients may have had information on the hard drive that could have been viewed.

What Information Was Involved?

While we have no reason to believe that your information was the target of the theft, and the password-protected backup data file requires proprietary program software to be read, there were some supporting documents on the hard drive as well that could have been viewed. That information may have included treatment consent forms, referral letters, emails, and some X-ray images. Specifically, names, addresses, dates of birth, some healthcare information, and a limited number of Social Security numbers were viewable. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying all patients.

What We Are Doing

We take the security of patient information seriously and have taken steps to prevent a recurrence, including ensuring all employees are aware of the requirement to protect patient information and increasing hardware security protocols. Given the difficulty to access the hard drive, we consider it highly unlikely that your information has been misused. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with MyIDCare. MyIDCare services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. With this protection, MyIDCare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised. To activate credit monitoring, you must be over the age of 18 and have established credit in the U.S. with a Social Security number in your name.

What You Can Do

We encourage you to contact ID Experts with any questions and to enroll in free MyIDCare services by calling 1-833-570-0376 or going to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect and using the Enrollment Code provided above. MyIDCare experts are available Monday through Friday from 7 am - 7 pm Mountain Time. Please note the deadline to enroll is June 2, 2020. We encourage you to take full advantage of this service offering. MyIDCare representatives have been fully versed on the incident and can answer questions or concerns you may have regarding protection of your personal information.

For More Information

You will find detailed instructions for enrollment on the enclosed Recommended Steps document. Also, you will need to reference the enrollment code at the top of this letter when calling or enrolling online, so please do not discard this letter. Please call 1-833-570-0376 or go to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect for assistance or for any additional questions you may have.

Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-833-570-0376 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.	The data breach was caused by the theft of a backup hard drive and other employee personal items. The data on the hard drive contained patient information such as names, addresses, dates of birth, healthcare information, and a limited number of Social Security numbers, which could have been viewed.

RE: Data Breach Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

Carnival Corporation & PLC (Carnival, Company, we, us, and/or our) is a travel leisure company. In late May 2019, we became aware of suspicious activity involving the Office 365 email systems of certain of our brands, including Carnival Cruise Line, Cunard North America, Holland America Line, Holland America Princess, Princess Cruises, P&O Cruises Australia, and Seabourn. Upon identifying this potential security issue, an investigation was commenced, with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity forensic experts to determine what happened and what data may have been impacted.

It now appears that between April 11 and July 23, 2019, an unsanctioned third party gained unauthorized access to some Carnival employee and crew email accounts. Due to this access, personal information belonging to residents of your state may have been accessed without authorization, including name, address, Social Security number, government identification information, such as passport number or driver's license number, credit card and financial account information, and health-related information. Please see Exhibit A for the total number of state residents potentially impacted by this incident.

Carnival is taking steps to enhance protections of our email systems, including implementing multi-factor authentication and other privacy and security controls, policies and procedures to help reduce the likelihood of such incidents occurring in the future. Carnival has also notified law enforcement of this incident and offered our full cooperation.

Notice of the incident was posted on our Holland America Line and Princess Cruises websites, and a press release was disseminated, on March 2, 2020. Notices will be mailed to consumers for whom we had up-to-date mailing information beginning the week of March 2, 2020. The notices will be customized by company and a sample of the notice to be sent to customers is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

Carnival is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through ID Experts for affected individuals. Carnival is also providing contact information for recipients who have questions, instructions on how they can sign up for credit monitoring, and additional steps they can take to protect themselves.

If your office requires any further information in this matter, please contact me at +1 (206) 839-4340 or aswaminathan@orrick.com.

Sincerely,

Aravind Swaminathan
Attorney for Carnival Corporation & PLC

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO BETTER PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;

7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years.

What Happened?

In late May 2019, we identified suspicious activity on our network. Upon identifying this potential security issue, we engaged cybersecurity forensic experts and initiated an investigation to determine what happened, what data was affected, and who was impacted.

What Information Was Involved?

The types of data potentially impacted varies by guest but can include: name, address, Social Security number, government identification number, such as passport number or drivers license number, credit card and financial account information, and health-related information. This list is not specific to each guest. We do not have any evidence of misuse of the personal information affecting any individual.

INFORMATION ON OBTAINING A FREE CREDIT REPORT

INFORMATION ON IMPLEMENTING A FRAUD ALERT OR SECURITY FREEZE

Consider contacting the three major credit bureaus at the addresses below to place a fraud alert on your credit report. A fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. A fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit. Instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. Although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumers credit report without written authorization. However, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing or other services. A credit reporting agency may not charge you to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. To place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, you must contact the three credit bureaus below:

2. Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File.

Whether or not you choose to use the complimentary 12-month credit monitoring services, we recommend that you place an initial one-year Fraud Alert on your credit files, at no charge. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you personally before they open any new accounts. To place a fraud alert, call any one of the three major credit bureaus at the numbers listed below. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, they will notify the others.

Equifax P.O. Box 105069 Atlanta, GA 30348 www.equifax.com 1-800-525-6285

Experian P.O. Box 2002 Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com 1-888-397-3742

TransUnion LLC P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016 www.transunion.com 1-800-680-7289

3. Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File.

If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a Security Freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:

Equifax Security Freeze P.O. Box 105788 Atlanta, GA 30348 https://www.freeze.equifax.com 1-800-349-9960

Experian Security Freeze P.O. Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 http://experian.com/freeze 1-888-397-3742

TransUnion Security Freeze P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016 http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze 1-888-909-8872

In order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the City in which you currently reside.

If you do place a security freeze prior to enrolling in the credit monitoring service as described above, you will need to remove the freeze to sign up for the credit monitoring service. After you sign up for the credit monitoring service, you may refreeze your credit file.

4. Obtaining a Free Credit Report.

Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

5. Additional Helpful Resources.

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many creditors will want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint with the FTC by contacting them on the web at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438	There was an email phishing incident that allowed unauthorized access to an employee's email account which contained personal information, including social security numbers.

WSU performed a comprehensive review of the server and, on January 13, 2020, determined that information stored in a historical database on the server contained your name, email address, date of birth, and Social Security number.

Upon learning of this incident, WSU immediately took steps to respond and worked with outside experts to confirm the nature and scope of the incident and identify individuals whose information may have been stored on the affected server.

Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://ide.myidcare.com/wsu and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-833-570-0375 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyID Care, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year. Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bure	The information indicates that an unauthorized person gained access to the computer server of Wichita State University and that they used it to operate various student and employee web portals.

The hacker was able to access the historical database on the server, which contained names, email addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers of individuals, including the recipient of this letter.

Doyle Wealth Management, Inc. (Doyle Wealth) is writing to notify you of a recent incident that may impact some of your personal information. Doyle Wealth is advising you of our investigation and the steps we have taken in response to this incident. While we have no reports of any data being misused as a result of this incident, we are providing you with steps you can take to protect your personal information should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On or about Monday, June 10, 2019, Doyle Wealth identified suspicious activity in an employee's email account. Doyle Wealth immediately changed the employee's email credentials and began an investigation into the incident. As part of the investigation, which was conducted with the assistance of a third-party forensic expert, it was determined that the employee's email account was subject to unauthorized access between Saturday, June 8, 2019, and Monday, June 10, 2019, and was used to access the email accounts of certain other employees. While our investigation was able to confirm access to the email accounts, the investigation was unable to rule out access to any emails or attachments. As a result, with the assistance of third-party forensics, we began an extensive review of the email accounts to determine whether they contained any protected information and to whom the information relates.

The forensic expert completed its time-consuming analysis of the contents of the email accounts and prepared a list of potentially impacted individuals whose information was determined to be present in the emails or attachments possibly viewed by the unauthorized person. Doyle Wealth then searched its internal records to locate the addresses for the affected individuals.

Does this Mean I am a Victim of Identity Theft?

No, this does not mean you are a victim of identity theft. You are being notified because your personal information may have been subject to unauthorized access. Doyle Wealth previously notified anyone whose personal information was contained in an email that was forwarded to an unauthorized email address. However, as always, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity.

Dear [Recipient],

Thank you for choosing Torrance Memorial Medical Center (Torrance Memorial) for your healthcare needs. We take patient privacy seriously and as part of that commitment, we are sending you this letter to make you aware of a recent potential data security incident that may have affected your personal information. Please read this letter carefully.

What Happened?

On January 6, 2020, Torrance Memorial was notified that a server used by its outside radiology vendor to receive radiological images from Torrance Memorial was unsecured and potentially accessible to unauthorized people. Upon receiving this notice, Torrance Memorial took immediate steps to investigate and address the issue. Our investigation revealed that the server, which is owned and maintained by the vendor at its office, was unsecured from June 20, 2019 until December 13, 2019 when the vendor discovered the issue and secured the server. The vendor has confirmed that subsequent scans of its systems show that the server is now secure. Based on our investigation, we have no evidence that any of your patient images were accessed by any unauthorized persons. We discovered that this vendor stores a small volume of patient images on this server temporarily and automatically deletes them from the server every 24 hours.

What Information Was Involved?

The images and information that were transmitted through the server were for the purpose of providing a professional radiologic reading of patient images. The patient image files on the unsecured server during that time include the patient name, date of birth, gender, medical record number, accession number, and referring physician (if available). The files did not contain social security numbers or any financial/payment information.

What We Are Doing

Out of an abundance of caution, we have chosen to notify patients whose records were temporarily stored on the server between June 20, 2019 and December 13, 2019 about this incident. Torrance Memorial takes the security and protection of your personal information seriously and we are holding the vendor accountable for raising their security standards to be as stringent as Torrance Memorial's.

PLACE A SECURITY FREEZE ON YOUR CREDIT FILE

If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, a security freeze might be right for you. Placing a freeze on your credit report will prevent lenders and others from accessing your credit report in connection with any new credit application, which will prevent them from extending credit. A security freeze generally does not apply to circumstances in which you have an existing account relationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control or similar activities. With a security freeze in place, you will be required to take special steps when you wish to apply for any type of credit. This process is also completed through each of the credit reporting agencies.

You should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets	The unauthorized individual was able to access the email account between July 1, 2019 and September 17, 2019.

Credit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified above to find out more information.

Individuals interacting with credit reporting agencies have rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. We encourage you to review your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act by visiting www.consumerfinance.gov/f/201504_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf, or by requesting information in writing from the Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20580.

We are writing to inform you of an incident involving certain EVERSANA employee email accounts. We are providing you with information about the incident, the steps we are taking in response, and additional steps you can take, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

EVERSANA has been working with third-party cybersecurity specialists to investigate unusual activity relating to EVERSANA's email environment. The investigation confirmed that certain email accounts were subject to unauthorized access by an unknown party. EVERSANA has since commenced a comprehensive and time-consuming review of the full contents of all impacted email accounts to determine what data, if any, may have been present and accessible to the unauthorized actor. We received the results of the account review on February 6, 2020. While our analysis of the results is ongoing, our preliminary review of the potentially impacted data shows that personal information, relating to EVERSANA employees and certain family members of EVERSANA employees, was potentially accessible within the accounts on separate occasions between April 1 and July 3, 2019.

What Information Was Involved?

While we currently have no evidence that personal information was subject to actual or attempted misuse, the investigation confirmed that your name, address, and other personal information was potentially accessible within one or more accounts.

What We Are Doing.

We take the security of information in our care very seriously. Since discovering this event, we worked diligently with third-party cybersecurity specialists to determine what happened and what data was potentially impacted. In an abundance of caution, EVERSANA notified federal law enforcement. We also implemented additional safeguards to further secure the information in our systems.

Re: Security Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Wichita State University (WSU), to notify your office of a security incident. In December 2019, WSU learned of a security incident involving unauthorized access to a computer server that WSU used to operate various student and employee web portals. WSU immediately secured this server and engaged a leading computer forensic firm to investigate the incident to determine its scope and impact.

The investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to this computer server between December 3, 2019, and December 5, 2019. WSU performed a comprehensive review of the server and, on January 13, 2020, determined that information stored in a historical database on the server contained the individuals' names, email addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.

On March 6, 2020, WSU began mailing written notifications to the 1,762 potentially affected Iowa residents in accordance with Iowa Code Ann. 715C.1 et seq. in substantially the same form as the enclosed letter. WSU is offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide affected Iowa residents with MyIDCare. MyIDCare services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. WSU also provided a telephone number for potentially affected individuals to call with any questions they may have about the incident.

To help prevent an incident like this from happening in the future, WSU is taking steps to enhance their existing security protocols and is re-educating its staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

M. Scott Koller

Additional Information to Protect Yourself

In addition to considering enrolling in credit monitoring services, it is always a good idea to remain vigilant, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports. Provided below are the names and contact information for the three major U.S. credit bureaus and additional information about steps you can take to obtain a free credit report and place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report.

If you believe you are a victim of fraud or identity theft, you should contact your local law enforcement agency, your state's attorney general, or the Federal Trade Commission.

INFORMATION ON OBTAINING A FREE CREDIT REPORT

U.S. residents are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. To order your free credit reports, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free (877) 726-1014.

INFORMATION ON IMPLEMENTING A FRAUD ALERT OR SECURITY FREEZE

You can contact the three major credit bureaus at the addresses below to place a fraud alert on your credit report. A fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. A fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit. Instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. Although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer's credit report without written authorization. However, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

A credit reporting agency may not charge you to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze.

To place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, you must contact the three credit bureaus below:

RE: Notice of Incident

Dear Sir/Madam:

We are writing to notify you of a security incident on behalf of our client, Woods & Woods, LLC, located in Evansville, Indiana. Washington residents may have been impacted by the security incident.

On February 1, 2020, Woods & Woods, LLC became aware that it was the victim of a ransomware attack. Woods & Woods promptly took steps to secure its information systems and investigate the incident, including contacting the FBI and hiring a forensic cybersecurity firm, to try to determine which, if any, information may have been accessed or stolen. As a result of the investigation, on February 25, 2020, Woods & Woods concluded that some information was stolen, but that it will likely not be able to determine all of the specific information that was accessed or stolen; therefore Woods & Woods is notifying all potentially affected individuals of the incident.

The data involved included demographic information of individuals, such as names, addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers, as well as medical information and bank account number and routing number of some individuals. Woods & Woods continues to pursue measures to protect and secure its data.

Woods & Woods will be mailing the enclosed notification letter to approximately 480 Washington residents in the next few days. Please contact me at scook@btlaw.com or 317-231-7237 if you have any questions or request additional information about the security incident.

Best regards,

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Wichita State University (WSU), to notify your office of a security incident involving 2,649 Washington residents. WSU is located in Wichita, Kansas.

In December 2019, WSU learned of a security incident involving unauthorized access to a computer server that WSU used to operate various student and employee web portals. WSU immediately secured this server and engaged a leading computer forensic firm to investigate the incident to determine its scope and impact.

The investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to this computer server between December 3, 2019, and December 5, 2019. WSU performed a comprehensive review of the server and, on January 13, 2020, determined that information stored in a historical database on the server contained the individuals' names, email addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.

On March 6, 2020, WSU began mailing notice via postal mail to the potentially affected Washington residents in accordance with Wests RCWA 19.255.010.1. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed. WSU is offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide affected Washington residents with MyIDCare. MyIDCare services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services.

WSU also provided a telephone number for potentially affected Washington residents to call with any questions they may have about the incident.

To help prevent an incident like this from happening in the future, WSU is taking steps to enhance their existing security protocols and is re-educating its staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

M. Scott Koller

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>:

Wichita State University (WSU) recently learned of a security incident that may have involved some of your information. We write to provide you with information on the incident, the steps WSU is taking in response to this incident, and steps that you may take to better protect your information, should you feel it is appropriate.

In December 2019, WSU learned of a security incident involving unauthorized access to a computer server that WSU used to operate various student and employee web portals. WSU immediately secured this server and engaged a leading computer forensic firm to investigate the incident to determine its scope and impact. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to this computer server between December 3, 2019, and December 5, 2019.

WSU performed a comprehensive review of the server and, on January 13, 2020, determined that information stored in a historical database on the server contained your name, email address, date of birth, and Social Security number.

Upon learning of this incident, WSU immediately took steps to respond and worked with outside experts to confirm the nature and scope of the incident and identify individuals whose information may have been stored on the affected server. While WSU does not have any evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident, out of an abundance of caution, WSU is offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with MyIDCare. MyIDCare services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. With this protection, MyIDCare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised. And, to help prevent a similar incident in the future, we are taking steps to enhance our existing security protocols and re-educating our staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

Therefore, we wanted to notify you of this matter, offer you complimentary identity protection services for 12 months, and provide you with steps you can take to protect your personal information.

What Happened:

On August 13, 2019, TRC discovered that an employee email account had been accessed without authorization. The unauthorized access was discovered when a fraudulent wire transfer, involving solely TRCs corporate account, was attempted. Upon discovery of the attempted fraudulent wire transfer, TRC immediately launched an investigation and determined that the employee email account had been used to facilitate the attempted fraudulent wire transfer. As a precautionary measure, TRC engaged a digital forensics firm to assist with its investigation. The investigation revealed that in the process of obtaining information to facilitate the attempted fraudulent wire transfer, the malicious actor may have accessed personal information without authorization. On February 25, 2020, we determined that this matter may have involved your personal information.

What Information Was Involved:

Information may have involved variable text.

What We Are Doing:

As soon as we learned of this matter, we took the measures referenced above. We also implemented a number of measures to further enhance the existing security of our email platform in an attempt to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.

Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://ide.myidcare.com/trc and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-833-554-0511 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus

Equifax Fraud Reporting 1-866-349-5191 P.O. Box 105069 Atlanta, GA 30348-5069 www.equifax.com

Experian Fraud Reporting 1-888-397-3742 P.O. Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com

TransUnion Fraud Reporting 1-800-680-7289 P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19022-2000 www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>> :

Wichita State University (WSU) recently learned of a security incident that may have involved some of your information. We write to provide you with information on the incident, the steps WSU is taking in response to this incident, and steps that you may take to better protect your information, should you feel it is appropriate.

What Happened ?

In December 2019, WSU learned of a security incident involving unauthorized access to a computer server that WSU used to operate various student and employee web portals. WSU immediately secured this server and engaged a leading computer forensic firm to investigate the incident to determine its scope and impact. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to this computer server between December 3, 2019 and December 5, 2019.

What Information Was Involved ?

WSU performed a comprehensive review of the server and, on January 13, 2020, determined that information stored in a historical database on the server contained your name, email address, date of birth, and Social Security number.

What We Are Doing

Upon learning of this incident, WSU immediately took steps to respond and worked with outside experts to confirm the nature and scope of the incident and identify individuals whose information may have been stored on the affected server. While WSU does not have any evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident, out of an abundance of caution, WSU is offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with MyIDCare. MyIDCare services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. With this protection, MyIDCare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised. And, to help prevent a similar incident in the future, we are taking steps to enhance our existing security protocols and re-educating our staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

What You Can Do

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. We also encourage you to contact ID Experts with any questions and to enroll in free MyIDCare services by calling 1-833-570-0375 or going to https://ide.myidcare.com/wsu and using the Enrollment Code provided above. MyIDCare experts are available Monday through Friday from 8 am - 8 pm Central Time. Please note the deadline to enroll is June 5, 2020. You will find detailed instructions for enrollment on the enclosed Recommended Steps document. Also, you will need to reference the enrollment code at the top of this letter when calling or enrolling online, so please do not discard this letter.

For More Information

We understand that you may have questions about this incident that are not addressed in this letter. To ensure your questions are answered in a timely manner, we established a dedicated assistance line at 1-833-570-0375, which may be reached Monday through Friday, between 8 am - 8 pm Central Time. WSU will not contact you by phone to request any personal information.

We apologize for any inconvenience or concern this may cause.

Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://ide.myidcare.com/wsu and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-833-570-0375 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069
Atlanta, GA 30348-5069
www.equifax.com

Experian Fraud Reporting
1-888-397-3742
P.O. Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013
www.experian.com

TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Visit the California Office of Privacy Protection (www.oag.ca.gov/privacy) for additional information on protection against identity theft.	The breach was the result of unauthorized access to a computer server by an outsider between December 3, 2019, and December 5, 2019.

We are writing to inform you of a recent incident involving your information. Woods & Woods, LLC, a law firm located in Evansville, Indiana, became aware on February 1, 2020, that we were the victim of a ransomware attack. The attackers claimed to have stolen some of our data and threatened to release the stolen data publicly. We immediately took steps to secure our information systems and investigate the incident, including contacting the FBI and hiring a forensic cybersecurity firm to try to determine which, if any, data may have been stolen.

As a result of the investigation, on February 25, 2020, we concluded that some information was stolen, but that we will likely not be able to determine all the specific data that was stolen. Therefore, we are notifying all potentially affected individuals of the incident. The data potentially stolen by the attackers included demographic information of individuals such as name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number, as well as medical information and bank account number and routing number for some individuals. We had your information because you are or were a client, you are or were a dependent of a client, or you contacted us and provided your information.

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>> :

Wichita State University (WSU) recently learned of a security incident that may have involved some of your information. We write to provide you with information on the incident, the steps WSU is taking in response to this incident, and steps that you may take to better protect your information, should you feel it is appropriate.

In December 2019, WSU learned of a security incident involving unauthorized access to a computer server that WSU used to operate various student and employee web portals. WSU immediately secured this server and engaged a leading computer forensic firm to investigate the incident to determine its scope and impact. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to this computer server between December 3, 2019 and December 5, 2019.

WSU performed a comprehensive review of the server and, on January 13, 2020, determined that information stored in a historical database on the server contained your name, email address, date of birth, and Social Security number.

Upon learning of this incident, WSU immediately took steps to respond and worked with outside experts to confirm the nature and scope of the incident and identify individuals whose information may have been stored on the affected server. While WSU does not have any evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident, out of an abundance of caution, WSU is offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with MyIDCare. MyIDCare services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. With this protection, MyIDCare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised. And, to help prevent a similar incident in the future, we are taking steps to enhance our existing security protocols and re-educating our staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. We also encourage you to contact ID Experts with any questions and to enroll in free MyIDCare services by calling 1-833-570-0375 or going to https://ide.myidcare.com/wsu and using the Enrollment Code provided above. MyIDCare experts are available Monday through Friday from 8 am - 8 pm Central Time. Please note the deadline to enroll is June 5, 2020.

You will find detailed instructions for enrollment on the enclosed Recommended Steps document. Also, you will need to reference the enrollment code at the top of this letter when calling or enrolling online, so please do not discard this letter.

We understand that you may have questions about this incident that are not addressed in this letter. To ensure your questions are answered in a timely manner, we established a dedicated assistance line at 1-833-570-0375, which may be reached Monday through Friday, between 8 am and 8 pm Central Time. WSU will not contact you by phone to request any personal information.

We apologize for any inconvenience or concern this may cause.

To Enroll, Please Call: 1-833-570-0375
Or Visit: https://ide.myidcare.com/wsu
Enrollment Code: <<XXXXXXXX>>

Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://ide.myidcare.com/wsu and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-833-570-0375 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus

P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

RE: Notice of Data Security Incident

Pursuant to RCW 42.56.590, the Washington State Patrol (WSP) is notifying you of a breach of security involving residents of the state of Washington.

Nature of Breach

On February 11, 2020, the WSP received a letter envelope from a law firm in Everett, WA, that was to contain a thumb drive containing documents provided to the law firm by WSP, under a protection order. The associated, non-redacted documents contained personal identifying information from a child exploitation investigation, conducted in 2016. The law firm represented one of the arrested suspects and requested documents of their client's arrest as well as several other documents associated with other suspects arrested during the operation. Witness personal identifying information was also contained in the provided documents.

The law firm received the thumb drive from WSP without incident but returned the thumb drive in a manner that did not demonstrate the same level of protection to prevent loss. As a result, the letter envelope the thumb drive was placed in, to send back to WSP, was breached and the thumb drive lost.

Number of Affected Individuals

We have identified 16 individuals who lost personal identifying information. Information each individual lost varies but includes some or a combination of the following: names and dates of birth, names and dates of birth of suspect/witness children, driver's license numbers and pictures, abstract of driving records, social security numbers, residence addresses, phone numbers, vehicle registrations, and criminal history information.

Steps WSP Has Taken With Respect To Incident

We are notifying the affected persons, by first class mail deposited on this date, of the possible exposure of their personal information. Attached is a sample copy of the notice.

Contact Information

For further information about this notice, please contact Captain Roger Wilbur at (360) 704-2395 or via email at Roger.Wilbur(a)wsp.wa.gov.

Subject: Inadvertent Release of Information

The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the potential loss of your personal information contained in electronic records maintained by the Washington State Patrol (WSP).

The WSP produced records containing personal information to a law firm, under a protective order. It is our understanding the law firm mailed a thumb drive containing those records to the WSP through the United States Postal Service (USPS). However, the thumb drive did not arrive at the WSP, and it appears to have been lost in transit. The WSP has contacted the relevant mail courier to locate the thumb drive, and has made a claim with the USPS to locate the thumb drive.

The personal information contained on the thumb drive may have included your name and date of birth, your child/children's names and dates of birth, address and driver's license number, abstract copy of driving record, social security number, residence address, criminal history, and/or phone number. We have no evidence any of the data has been accessed or used, but we want to notify you of the possibility. We apologize for this incident and any inconvenience it may have caused.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this incident, please contact Captain Roger Wilbur at (360) 704-2395 or via email at Roger.Wilbur(%wsp.wa.gov.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened?
On March 11, 2020, New Heights Ventures discovered that an outside entity gained access to a member of management's email and cloud-based server password. They then forwarded an email to the member of management's contacts. Two New Heights Ventures office employees received the email from the member of management and entered their passwords as well. At that point, it was quickly discovered that this was a malicious event, and we took steps to cut access from the outside entity. The member of management, whose account was breached, realized he had received an email seemingly from an employee of another agency and entered his email and password on 3/6/2020 to try to open a document. This appears to be how the perpetrators emailed his contact list.

What Information Was Involved?
Since the email and cloud-based server use the same password, electronic copies of employee files could have been accessed. Electronic files of employee passwords can include information such as names, birthdates, social security numbers, Livescan results, medical leave information, etc.

What We Are Doing.
We take this incident extremely seriously and have now initiated a 2-factor authorization for cloud-based server and email access and are looking at other options to protect New Heights Ventures employee and person-served information. We are also looking at removing cloud-based storage for employee files and using an onsite encrypted server for this information. Additionally, we are contacting the various governmental agencies, which are to be involved in this type of incident.

What You Can Do.
In the event the perpetrators accessed employee file information, we recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. Call any one of the three major credit bureaus. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. The initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You can renew it after one year.

Request that all three credit reports be sent to you, free of charge, for your review. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Thieves may hold stolen information to use at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If your personal information has been misused, visit the FTC's site at IdentityTheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations. Additionally, please contact New Heights Ventures if your information is misused so we can work together to bring the perpetrator to justice. You also may want to consider contacting the major credit bureaus at the telephone numbers above to place a free credit freeze on your credit file. A credit freeze means potential creditors cannot get your credit report. That makes it less likely that an identity thief can open new accounts in your name.

Other Important Information.
We greatly value your employment with New Heights Ventures and are extremely upset this occurred. We will take the necessary steps to prevent this from happening again as we want your information to be kept safe from intrusion. Please contact us for help with taking any of the requested steps, such as getting fraud alerts and/or credit freezes.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

Greater Washington Educational Telecommunications Association, Inc. (WETA) is writing to inform you of an incident that may affect the security of some of your personal information. While there is currently no evidence that your information has been misused as a result of this incident, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing you with information about the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

WETA recently became aware of unusual activity relating to a limited number of WETA employee and consultant email accounts. We immediately commenced an investigation with the assistance of third-party computer specialists. The investigation determined that these email accounts were accessed without authorization. While the investigation did not determine that personal information had been viewed by an unauthorized actor, WETA could not rule out the possibility of such activity. Therefore, we immediately began a thorough review of the contents of the email accounts to determine whether sensitive information was present at the time of the incident. Through this process, we determined that your personal information was present in at least one of the involved email accounts.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation determined that at the time of the incident, the following types of your personal information were present in at least one of the involved email accounts: your <<b2b_text_1 (Impacted Data>>. To date, we are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information in relation to this incident.

What We Are Doing.

WETA takes the confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in its care very seriously. While WETA has security measures in place to protect information in its care, we are also taking steps to implement additional safeguards and review WETA policies and procedures in order to ensure we protect the security of information on our systems. Specifically, WETA immediately changed the credentials for the involved email accounts. As an added precaution, WETA is providing you with access to twelve months of identity monitoring services from Kroll at no cost to you. A description of services and instructions on how to enroll can be found within the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Personal Information. Please note that you must complete the enrollment process yourself, as we are not permitted to enroll you in these services on your behalf.

Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;

7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Re: Notification of Data Security Incident

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. KMS Financial Services, Inc. (KMS) recently discovered that an unauthorized individual gained access to an email account of NorthWest Investment and Retirement Group, LLC (NorthWest) that contained your personal information. We take the privacy and security of your information very seriously, which is why we are notifying you of this incident, offering you complimentary identity monitoring services, and providing you with steps to help protect your personal information.

What Happened?

On December 3, 2019, KMS detected unusual activity in an email account of NorthWest during a routine email audit. We immediately secured the email account and launched an investigation with the help of an independent digital forensics firm to determine what happened. The digital forensics firm discovered that the email account was exposed between September 26, 2019, and December 3, 2019. We conducted a data review project to determine whether the email account contained personal information. On January 27, 2020, we learned that the impacted email account contained some of your personal information. We then worked to identify up-to-date address information to notify you of this incident.

Please note that this unauthorized access was limited to information transmitted via email and did not affect any other information or transaction systems. We have no evidence to suggest that your personal information has been misused. Nonetheless, as a precautionary measure, we are notifying you of the incident and providing you with access to complimentary identity monitoring services.

What Information Was Involved?

The following information may have been contained within the accessed email account: your <<b2b_text_1(Impacted Data)>>.

What We Are Doing

As soon as we discovered this incident, we took the necessary measures to secure the email account and enhance email security through the implementation of multi-factor authentication to minimize the likelihood of a similar incident occurring in the future. We are also offering you complimentary identity monitoring services through Kroll, a global leader in risk mitigation and response. These services include Credit Monitoring, $1 Million Identity Fraud Loss Reimbursement, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 12 months. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear Customer,

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. We are writing to let you know about a recent incident that may have involved your personal information. This notice explains the incident, the measures we have taken in response, and some additional steps you may consider taking.

What Happened?

On January 22, 2020, Zerbee, LLC, learned that it may have experienced a security incident involving unauthorized access to certain customer payment card information. Upon receiving this information, Zerbee commenced an investigation into the incident.

Based on its investigation, Zerbee determined that malicious code was uploaded to Zerbee's website allowing unauthorized access to certain payment card information used on Zerbee's website. Zerbee's investigation determined that the malicious code was present on Zerbee's website between October 22, 2019, and January 7, 2020. As such, Zerbee is notifying customers that used a payment card on the Zerbee website during this timeframe that their payment card may be at risk.

What Information Was Involved?

The malicious code allowed unauthorized access to payment card information from your transaction on Zerbee.com, including your credit card number, expiration date, cardholder name, and card verification value (CVV) number. In some cases, the malicious code also allowed access to certain information such as your name, email, phone number, and/or billing/shipping addresses.

What We Are Doing

Upon learning of the incident, Zerbee promptly commenced an investigation. We have taken steps to determine how the incident occurred and to ensure appropriate action is being taken in response. Zerbee takes the protection of your personal information very seriously, and will continue to take steps to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident.

What You Can Do

You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions, as major credit card companies have rules that restrict them from requiring you to pay for fraudulent charges that are timely reported.

In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or law enforcement, such as your state attorney general, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. You can contact the FTC at:

Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20580
(877) IDTHEFT (438-4338)
https://www.identitytheft.gov/

If you find that your information has been misused, the FTC encourages you to file a complaint with the FTC and to take these additional steps: (1) close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently; and (2) file and keep a copy of a local police report as evidence of the identity theft crime and in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

For more information on identity theft prevention and certain state-specific information, please see the information about additional steps you can take that follow this letter.

SHR recently informed us that, between January 22 and January 29, 2020, an unauthorized party gained access to guest reservation data for a limited number of guests whose information was maintained on SHR's systems. SHR has indicated that the affected reservation information may have included guests' names; contact information; payment card information, including cardholder name, payment card number, expiration date, and security code; and other booking information entered at the time of reservation.

We are taking this matter very seriously. The protection of our guest data is a top priority for us. After learning of the issue, we quickly began working with SHR to address the matter and identify our affected guests. We understand that SHR took steps to secure its systems and stop the unauthorized access to its systems. SHR also has engaged an outside firm to conduct a forensic investigation and contacted law enforcement authorities. The relevant payment card brands also have been notified of the issue.

As indicated above, this issue occurred on SHR's systems and did not impact our systems. We take our obligation to safeguard our guests' information very seriously and are alerting you about this issue so you can take steps to help protect yourself.

However, because we were unable to rule out the possibility that an unauthorized user accessed personal information, we are notifying you of this event.

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO FURTHER PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant, especially over the next 12 to 24 months, and review your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC).

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for one (1) year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

What Happened?

TRP became aware of unusual activity involving an employee email account and immediately began an investigation, with the assistance of third-party computer forensic investigators. The investigation determined that an unauthorized actor may have accessed a single employee email account on October 2, 2019. While the investigation did not determine that specific information within the account was accessed, we conducted a comprehensive programmatic and manual review of the contents of the email account to determine the type of personal information contained in the account and to whom the information related. TRP's review of the email account determined that your personal information was present in the account at the time of the incident. To date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that at the time of the incident, the email account contained information including your <<ClientDef1(Impacted Data)>>.

What We Are Doing.

The security of information in our care is among our highest priorities. Upon learning of this incident, we quickly took steps to confirm the security of our email system. We reset the password for the involved account and reviewed our company policies and procedures relating to data security. In an abundance of caution, we are also notifying potentially affected individuals, including you, so that you may take further steps to best protect your personal information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so. Although we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this event, we arranged to have Kroll monitor your identity for 12 months at no cost to you as an added precaution. We also provided relevant regulatory notices.

What You Can Do.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

GE has been informed that one of its service providers, Canon Business Process Services, Inc. (Canon), experienced a data security incident. GE contracts with Canon to process documents of GE employees, former employees, and beneficiaries entitled to benefits. The issue did not affect GE's own systems.

GE systems, including your personal information in our systems, have not been affected by the Canon data security incident. We will work hard to understand how the unauthorized individual was able to access Canon's systems. We are taking steps to help ensure appropriate measures are implemented to prevent a reoccurrence of this kind of incident.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear Customer,

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. We are writing to let you know about a recent incident that may have involved your personal information. This notice explains the incident, the measures we have taken in response, and some additional steps you may consider taking.

What Happened?

On January 22, 2020, Zerbee, LLC, learned that it may have experienced a security incident involving unauthorized access to certain customer payment card information. Upon receiving this information, Zerbee commenced an investigation into the incident.

Based on its investigation, Zerbee determined that malicious code was uploaded to Zerbee's website allowing unauthorized access to certain payment card information used on Zerbee's website. Zerbee's investigation determined that the malicious code was present on Zerbee's website between October 22, 2019, and January 7, 2020. As such, Zerbee is notifying customers that used a payment card on the Zerbee website during this timeframe that their payment card may be at risk.

What Information Was Involved?

The malicious code allowed unauthorized access to payment card information from your transaction on Zerbee.com, including your credit card number, expiration date, cardholder name, and card verification value (CVV) number. In some cases, the malicious code also allowed access to certain information such as your name, email, phone number, and/or billing/shipping addresses.

What We Are Doing

Upon learning of the incident, Zerbee promptly commenced an investigation. We have taken steps to determine how the incident occurred and to ensure appropriate action is being taken in response. Zerbee takes the protection of your personal information very seriously, and will continue to take steps to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident.

What You Can Do

You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions, as major credit card companies have rules that restrict them from requiring you to pay for fraudulent charges that are timely reported.

In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or law enforcement, such as your state attorney general, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. You can contact the FTC at:

Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20580
(877) IDTHEFT (438-4338)
https://www.identitytheft.gov/

If you find that your information has been misused, the FTC encourages you to file a complaint with the FTC and to take these additional steps: (1) close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently; and (2) file and keep a copy of a local police report as evidence of the identity theft crime and in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. For more information on identity theft prevention and certain state-specific information, please see the information about additional steps you can take that follow this letter.

News Release

March 20, 2020

Oregon Department of Human Services Notifies Public of Data Breach

(Salem, Ore.) On March 6, the Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS) discovered a phishing incident that affected one staff member's email. The Department of Human Services takes the privacy and confidentiality of employee and client information seriously. Established information technology security processes enabled the agency to detect and contain the incident quickly and stop the unauthorized access.

What happened?

A spear-phishing email was sent to a DHS employee. The employee opened the phishing email and exposed their credentials to an outside entity. The agency cannot confirm that any client or employee's personal information was copied or used inappropriately.

What DHS is doing about it

DHS is thoroughly reviewing the incident and the information involved. DHS plans to contract with an outside entity to clarify the number and identities of any individuals whose information was compromised, and the specific kinds of information involved. While there is no indication that any protected health information was copied or used inappropriately, DHS will notify any individuals whose information was compromised. DHS will provide identity theft protection services to potentially impacted employees and clients.

The security and confidentiality of private health information is critical to the Department of Human Services. While the department cannot confirm that any client's personal information was acquired from its email system or used inappropriately, it is notifying the public because information was accessible to an unauthorized person or persons. DHS will provide updates as more information is known.

# # #	The breach was a result of a phishing incident which affected one staff member's email, where the employee opened the phishing email and exposed their credentials to an outside entity.
Insufficient information	There is insufficient information provided to make a determination regarding the type of breach that occurred at General Electric.
What happened?
On January 23, 2020, two of our counselorsâ€™ cell phones were stolen from Renewâ€™s office. The phones had access
to Renewâ€™s Gmail account, which had some messages containing personal information for some clients. The phones
were not secured by password and could have been accessed by the person who took them. However, we immediately
notified the cellular carriers, who blocked cellular access to the phones within hours after the theft. Our investigation
has thus revealed no evidence that your personal information was actually accessed by any unauthorized person, but
we have chosen to notify all potentially affected individuals about this incident out of an abundance of caution. & What information was involved?
The Gmail account potentially accessible on the two cell phones included messages containing names, addresses,
telephone numbers, email addresses, and in some cases medical diagnosis information of some of Renewâ€™s clients
used for billing purposes, as well as some appointment dates. In a small percentage of cases there could also have
been Social Security numbers and financial account or card numbers in the Gmail account.	The theft of unsecured cell phones with access to Renew's Gmail account which contained personal information of clients, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, medical diagnosis information, and in some cases, Social Security numbers and financial information, does not indicate hacking or intentional insider activity, but is instead an unintended disclosure due to physical loss.

On January 23, 2020, two of our counselors' cell phones were stolen from Renew's office. The phones had access to Renew's Gmail account, which contained some messages with personal information for some clients. The phones were not secured by a password and could have been accessed by the person who stole them.

What we are doing?

After having service to the stolen phones disconnected, we obtained new phones for the counselors and have ensured that they are now secured by a password. In an abundance of caution, we are notifying all individuals whose information may have been accessible on the phones during the short period before they were blocked.

Additional Steps to Help Protect Your Information

Review personal account statements and credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing personal account statements and monitoring credit reports to detect any errors or unauthorized activity. Under federal law, you are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call (877) 322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items, you should report any incorrect information on your report to the credit reporting agency.

Report suspected fraud. You have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You should report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement, your state's Attorney General, and/or the Federal Trade Commission.

Place Fraud Alerts. A fraud alert tells businesses that check your credit that they should check with you before opening a new account. Starting September 21, 2018, when you place a fraud alert, it will last one year, instead of 90 days. Fraud alerts will still be free, and identity theft victims can still get an extended fraud alert for seven years. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. To place a security freeze, contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies by phone or online.

Place a Security Freeze. Security freezes, also known as credit freezes, restrict access to your credit file, making it harder for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name.

or attachments, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized person. Out of an abundance of caution, Legacy conducted a

We take the protection of customer information seriously and want to ensure that you are aware of what occurred, how we are responding, and what precautionary measures you can take.

The information that was vulnerable included name, address, e-mail address, phone number, full debit or credit card number, expiration date, and Card Verification Value (CVV) number. Username and password may have potentially been vulnerable to the extent they were used to checkout.

Upon identifying this security concern, we immediately disabled the use of all debit and credit cards on eFaucets.com. We also removed the offending scripts from our database. While we believe eFaucets.com can be made secure to resume debit and credit card transactions, we have made the business decision not to do so. Since early February eFaucets.com has not accepted any debit or credit card information. Currently, we still offer customers the choice of using PayPal or placing their order over the phone.

Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by Rosenfelt, Siegel & Goldberg certified public accountants (RSG) that may have impacted a limited amount of your personal information, including your name and Social Security number. We take the privacy and security of your information seriously and sincerely apologize for any concern or inconvenience this may cause you. This letter contains information about steps you can take to protect your information and resources we are making available to help you.

What happened?

On November 14, 2019, RSG became aware of suspicious activity associated with one of its corporate email accounts, and immediately hired independent forensic experts to conduct an investigation. The forensic investigators found that the account was accessed by an unauthorized individual but were unable to determine whether any emails or attachments stored in the account were viewed by the individual.

On January 31, 2020, our forensic investigators informed us that your information was present in the corporate email account, and we wanted to notify you of this incident out of an abundance of caution. Any information sent over our secure file share website remains unaffected and secure.

What information was involved?

From the forensic review, it appears that your name and Social Security number were found in the affected email account. While we have no evidence that the unauthorized individual viewed, opened, or downloaded any emails or documents containing your information from the affected email account, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to let you know about this incident.

What we are doing:

We have arranged for you to receive credit monitoring and identity restoration services at no cost. Please follow the instruction in this letter to enroll in these services. RSG has also taken steps to prevent a similar incident in the future. Immediately after discovering the suspicious activity, we changed the password and have enabled additional security controls to protect our email environment.

What you can do:

We are not aware of any evidence that your information was misused by the unauthorized individual. However, as a safeguard, we are offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with MyIDCare. MyIDCare services include: 12 months of Credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed ID theft recovery services.

Recommended Steps to Help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-800-939-4170 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

What Happened?

We recently discovered that in October 2019, a third-party gained unauthorized access to our database, which allowed them to access information. Fortunately, no credit card or payment information was compromised as a result of this breach.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation indicates that account information for current and former Social Bluebook customers may have been accessed. This information includes a customer's first and last name, as well as their email address. Credit card information and credit card data are not stored on Social Bluebook and therefore were not compromised.

What Are We Doing?

Upon discovering the breach, Social Bluebook opened a full security audit to uncover potential issues that need to be resolved immediately. We have also notified the proper authorities regarding the breach. Protection of your data is core to our mission, and we will be taking every precaution to perform better in the future.

What You Can Do

Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf. Alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies.

TransUnion 1-888-909-8872 www.transunion.com P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19022

Fraud Alerts: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. As specified below to find out more information:

7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security freeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (PIN) or password, or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze.

To remove the security freeze or lift the freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you must call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper identification (name, address, and social security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identities of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to remove or lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time.

If you do not have internet access but would like to learn more about how to place a security freeze on your credit report, contact the California Attorney General's Office at (916) 445-9555.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: This notice will be updated with any new significant information learned after its submission. By providing this notice, the YMCA of Columbia-Willamette (the YMCA) does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Oregon law, the applicability of the Oregon data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event:
The YMCA discovered unusual activity related to an employee email account. The YMCA immediately began an investigation and with the help of third-party forensic investigators, it was determined that a single employee email account may have been accessed without authorization between December 19, 2019, and December 27, 2019. Although it was unclear which specific emails within the account were viewed by an unauthorized actor, the YMCA conducted a comprehensive review of the email account to identify what information could potentially have been viewed during this time. Through this process, the YMCA determined that certain personal information was present in the email account at the time of the incident. To date, the YMCA is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this information as a result of this incident. The types of information potentially impacted in relation to this incident include the following: name, Social Security number, driver license/state identification number, payment card information, medical information, health insurance information, username and password or login information, and/or passport number. The impacted data elements were not the same for each affected individual.

Notice to Oregon Residents:
On or about March 27, 2020, the YMCA began mailing written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes six hundred ninety-six Oregon residents. Written notice to the individuals is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken:
Immediately upon learning of this incident, the YMCA worked diligently with the assistance of third-party forensics specialists to investigate the nature and scope of the event, to review the information that may have been contained in the email account to confirm what data was present, and to identify to whom this information related. This forensics process included both a programmatic and a manual review of documents. Once this investigation was complete, the YMCA undertook review of its systems and records to determine appropriate contact information for individuals potentially involved in the data event to provide notice of the event and access to resources to assist these individuals in learning more about the event and steps they may wish to take to protect their information. The YMCA is providing affected individuals access to twelve (12) months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services, through Kroll Cyber Security. Additionally, the YMCA is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements and explanation of benefits forms and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Exhibit A:
Dear <<FirstName>> <<MiddleName>> <<LastName>> <<NameSuffix>>,

We are writing to	The data breach was caused by an unauthorized access to an employee email account that was subjected to a comprehensive review to identify what information could have potentially been viewed. Personal information including, but not limited to, name, Social Security number, driver license/state identification number, payment card information, medical information, health insurance information, username and password or login information, and/or passport number was exposed but to date YMCA is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this information as a result of this incident.
Insufficient information	Insufficient information provided to determine the type of breach.
We recently learned that a software code change made to the MyBlue Member Portal inadvertently
altered Blue Cross and Blue Shield Federal Employee Program (FEP) member usersâ€™ access for a short
period of time. The change was made as part of a good faith effort to improve FEP membersâ€™ secure access
to their information, due to changes being made to a third-party web browserâ€™s security requirement.
Through this code change, we have learned that your personal and health information may have been
accessible to other MyBlue Portal members between the evening of February 4, 2020 and the morning of
February 5, 2020. When we learned of this issue on the morning of February 5, 2020, we promptly
terminated all member access to the MyBlue Member Portal to investigate and remediate the issue. As
a result of the investigation, by February 25, 2020, we were able to determine that your personal
information may have been accessible to another FEP member who had logged into the MyBlue Portal
with their own MyBlue credentials during the brief incident window. However, to date, we are not aware
of any misuse of the information that was potentially accessible because of this incident.& Although we were able to conclude that your personal and health information was accessible to another
FEP member during the incident window, we are unable to determine what specific information, if
any, was accessed. This is because the information that may have been accessible through the MyBlue
Member Portal to another FEP member varied by member. However, the information may have included
(1) information to identify and contact you (such as first, middle, and last name, address, phone number(s),
Social Security number, email address, group and member ID numbers, and date of birth); (2) information
related to medical and/or claims histories (such as medical providers, dates of service, diagnoses, treatment
information, test results and medical records); and (3) information regarding prescriptions, including drug
name, number, prescriber name and pharmacy name. The incident did not involve potential access to
your full financial account, or credit or debit card numbers.	The breach involved an unintended disclosure of personal information due to a software code change that allowed other Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal Employee Program members to inadvertently access other members' personal and health information between February 4 and February 5, 2020. Although it is not clear if any of the information was actually accessed, the affected information included identifying information, medical and claims history, and prescription information.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>> ,

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to you to let you know about a security incident that may involve your personal information. We are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution and to inform you of steps you can take to help protect your information.

What Happened

Between October 31, 2019 and December 26, 2019, our web server was breached and order information was potentially collected. While our system does not store payment card information, the unauthorized third party may nonetheless have been able to access and acquire information used to pay for purchases in our online store. Though you may have contacted our Support Center directly via phone, our online store uses the same system which our Technical Support Team also utilizes to place phone orders.

What Information Was Involved

The personal information potentially involved may have included first and last names, shipping and billing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and credit card information including account numbers, expiration dates, and three-digit security codes. Please note that you are receiving this notification only because an attempted transaction occurred in our system during the potentially exposed time period; we cannot confirm your actual information was in fact involved in the potential incident.

What We Are Doing

We take this matter very seriously and apologize for any inconvenience caused. Upon learning of the incident, we took immediate measures to contain and neutralize the vulnerability and immediately began a forensic investigation to determine the extent of the third party criminal conduct. We have also deployed, and continue to deploy, additional security procedures to prevent future attacks. Finally, we have engaged cyber security legal counsel to guide us through this process.

In addition, we are offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with MyIDCare. MyIDCare services include: 24 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services.

4. Review Your Credit Reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the Three Credit Bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Equifax P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, Georgia 30374 1 (866)349-5191 www.equifax.com

Experian P.O. Box 4500 Allen, Texas 75013 1 (888) 397-3742 www.experian.com

TransUnion P.O. Box 2000 Chester, Pennsylvania 19016-2000 1 (888) 909-8872 www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year. Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. Please call 800-939-4170 or go to https://ide.myidcare.com/customending; https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect for assistance or for any additional questions you may have.

We remain committed to protecting your personal information. We again sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident. We are undertaking measures to further secure your personal information, and are continuously monitoring our processes to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Sincerely,

R. Jeffrey Bush, President

We are writing to inform you that on Saturday, March 14, 2020, The Jamaica National Group experienced a data breach as a result of a ransomware attack. Although our services are now substantially back online, we have identified that data relating to some members and customers was possibly taken during the data security incident. However, our investigations have found that some of your information would have been accessible to an unauthorized third party, therefore, it is possible, albeit unlikely, that you could be amongst those whose personal data was taken.

The information relating to you that may have been taken, may be information that is required to open an account with JN Bank, such as:

- The name and branch at which you opened an account
- The type of account that you opened
- Your personal customer information form
- Proof of address
- Proof of employment
- Copy identification documents
- Copy birth certificate
- Character reference details

There is also the possibility that for some customers credit card details could have been compromised.

We have already taken several steps in response to the incident. As required by law, we have advised the regulatory agencies in all countries in which we operate. Additionally, we have:

- Notified the Police and security agencies locally and overseas
- Advised relevant banks
- Advised our credit card supplier, which is doing enhanced monitoring of credit card transactions
- Undertaken a complete review of our IT systems to further strengthen our infrastructure
- Appointed a specialist IT security and forensic provider to investigate the incident
- Implemented a special email address wecare@jngroup.com to support customers who may have queries. Customers may also call 876-968-5096; 876-960-5508
- Established a process to help customers through this period, which could include credit remediation and identity protection services, such as LifeLock and Identity Force for a period of 12 months.

We have no evidence that the data that may have been taken was targeted or has been misused. However, we think this kind of incident needs to be treated with caution. Given the nature of this information, it is important that we make you aware of the incident and any associated risks.

There is a risk that the data that may have been extracted from our network could be used to attempt to facilitate fraud, identity theft or social engineering attempts. As a result, we recommend that you exercise increased vigilance in all matters relating to your personal and/or business details over the next 12-24 months, and report suspected identity theft incidents to JN Bank, law enforcement including your Attorney General, and the Federal Trade Commission.

To assist, we are able to offer 12 months of credit and identity monitoring at no cost through a leading credit monitoring service provider. Please let us know if you are interested, and we will send you the information and activation codes that you will need to set it up.

If you would like to institute a fraud alert and/or security freeze at no charge, you may contact the major credit agencies. The credit agencies may be contacted as follows:

TransUnion
P.O. Box 1000 Chester, PA 19022

You have the right to obtain a police report concerning the data breach. It may also be prudent for you to obtain replacement identity documents. We would suggest that you contact your local issuing authority and follow their advice.

In addition, it is good practice to:

- Check that all details for direct debits are up to date, and delete any that are no longer needed;
- Check bank accounts regularly and contact the bank if you see any transactions you do not recognize. If the transaction relates to a bank account that you hold with us, please contact 876-968-5096; 876-960-5508 or by emailing wecare@jngroup.com
- Be suspicious if anyone contacts you by email, phone call or text message asking you to confirm your personal details;
- Enable two-factor authentication on all of your online services that offer this;
- Use different passwords for different online accounts.

If you have any questions, then please don't hesitate to reply to this email or contact us at 876-968-5096; 876-960-5508 or by emailing wecare@jngroup.com. We will be happy to help you in any way we can.

We are sincerely sorry for any concern and inconvenience this may have caused you. We would like to reassure you that we take our responsibilities for the protection of your data very seriously.	The breach resulted from a ransomware attack, indicating that an outside party gained unauthorized access to Jamaica National Group Limited and Jamaica National Bank's IT systems.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Breach

Dear [IndividualFirstName]:

I am writing to inform you of an incident that affected the MyBlue Member Portal and involved your information.

What happened?

We recently discovered that a software code change made to the MyBlue Member Portal inadvertently altered Blue Cross and Blue Shield Federal Employee Program (FEP) member users' access for a short period of time. The change was made as part of a good faith effort to improve FEP members' secure access to their information due to changes being made to a third-party web browser's security requirement. Through this code change, we have learned that your personal and health information may have been accessible to other MyBlue Portal members between the evening of February 4, 2020, and the morning of February 5, 2020. When we learned of this issue on the morning of February 5, 2020, we promptly terminated all member access to the MyBlue Member Portal to investigate and remediate the issue. As a result of the investigation, by February 25, 2020, we were able to determine that your personal information may have been accessible to another FEP member who had logged into the MyBlue Portal with their own MyBlue credentials during the brief incident window. However, to date, we are not aware of any misuse of the information that was potentially accessible because of this incident.

What information may have been involved?

Although we were able to conclude that your personal and health information was accessible to another FEP member during the incident window, we are unable to determine what specific information, if any, was accessed. This is because the information that may have been accessible through the MyBlue Member Portal to another FEP member varied by member. However, the information may have included (1) information to identify and contact you (such as first, middle, and last name, address, phone number(s), Social Security number, email address, group and member ID numbers, and date of birth); (2) information related to medical and/or claims histories (such as medical providers, dates of service, diagnoses, treatment information, test results, and medical records); and (3) information regarding prescriptions, including drug name, number, prescriber name, and pharmacy name. The incident did not involve potential access to your full financial account or credit or debit card numbers.

What we are doing?

As soon as we discovered the incident, we promptly took down the MyBlue Member Portal and launched an investigation. We resolved the issue and then restored the MyBlue Member Portal services. Since resolution, we have not been notified of the issue recurring, although we continue to monitor the Portal for any related issues. While we are unaware of any misuse of your information as a result of this incident, including your credit or financial information, in an abundance of caution, we have nonetheless arranged to offer you credit monitoring and identity restoration services for a period of two years, free of charge through Experian. You have until June 30, 2020, to activate these services, and instructions on how to activate these services are included in the attachments to this letter.

What you can do?

As mentioned above, we are not aware of any misuse of your information to date as a result of this matter. The enclosed Reference Guide includes additional information on general steps you can take to monitor and protect your personal information. We encourage you to remain vigilant in monitoring your account statements, bills, notices, and insurance transactions for incidents of any unusual or unauthorized activity and to promptly report such incidents to your health care provider or your local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan. Additionally, as a proactive step, we encourage you to review your personal information contained on the MyBlue Member Portal.

For More Information.

If you have any questions about this matter or would like additional information, please call the FEP National Information Center toll-free at 1-800-411-BLUE (2583) (callers may press #1, then press #0 to speak to a live agent). This call center is open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, excluding weekends and holidays. We apologize for any concern this event may cause you, and we greatly appreciate your understanding. We regret that this incident occurred. We take the privacy of your personal information with the utmost seriousness and have implemented steps to prevent this in the future.

Sincerely,

Steps You Can Take to Protect Against Identity Theft and Fraud

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:

On April 24, 2019, the cyber criminals launched a sophisticated ransomware attack, which disabled various 
computer systems across the company. Due to the nature and effects of the ransomware attack, the exact scope of 
the security incident and the unauthorized actorsâ€™ access to our network is indeterminable. Our in-depth 
cybersecurity forensics review of the evidence available has not revealed any unauthorized access or misuse of
personally identifying, sensitive information. However, due to the limited nature of the evidence available, the 
possibility of unauthorized access cannot, at this time, be definitively ruled out. We are contacting you to provide 
you with further information and resources relating to this attack. 
& Due to the nature of the ransomware attack, and despite our investigation, we are unable to determine exactly 
what information the attackers may have accessed and therefore must presume the attackers may have accessed 
and/or duplicated any of the information available within Gurley Leepâ€™s corporate network. This information
includes names, current and/or past addresses, social security numbers, birthdates, employee benefits information,

Plano Synergy observed suspicious activity on our e-commerce websites and immediately launched an investigation into this activity. Third-party forensic investigators assisted Plano Synergy with the investigation and its efforts to determine what happened and what information may be affected.

On February 26, 2020, the investigation determined that Plano Synergy was the victim of a sophisticated cyber-attack that may have resulted in the code capturing certain customer information provided to make purchases on our e-commerce website at certain times between December 28, 2019, and January 7, 2020. The investigation identified code that was inserted into the checkout page and later determined that this code was capable of collecting certain customer information when entered on the checkout page. Plano Synergy promptly removed the code at issue to prevent any further potential issues. In addition, out of an abundance of caution, Plano Synergy temporarily disabled all online payment card transaction functionality on its e-commerce websites.

On March 3, 2020, Plano Synergy determined that certain individuals' name and credit card information were impacted by this event. At this time, you can safely and securely use your payment card at our website.

What Are We Doing?

We take this incident and the security of your information seriously. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately took steps to address the issue and we conducted an investigation to determine how this incident occurred and what information may be affected. These efforts included temporarily disabling transaction functionality, immediately removing the malicious codes, hardening the network environment, and monitoring for additional attempts to infiltrate the system.

The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent The Northshore Utility District (Northshore) located at 6830 NE 185th St, Kenmore, Washington 98028, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of certain customers personally identifiable information. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission.

By providing this notice, Northshore does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Washington law, the applicability of the Washington data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On February 12, 2020, a Northshore employee received an email that appeared to be from a legitimate King County, WA employee. It was discovered that the email contained a link that allowed unknown actors to temporarily gain access to the employee's email account. Northshore quickly launched an investigation and began working with computer forensic specialists to determine the full nature and scope of the activity.

The investigation confirmed that one employee email account was accessed without authorization for a limited period of time on February 12, 2020. However, the investigation was unable to determine what, if any, emails and attachments in the account were viewed by the unauthorized actor.

Northshore undertook a comprehensive review of the contents of impacted email account to identify those who may have had personal information impacted as a result of this event. This review was completed on or about March 9, 2020.

The personal information impacted by this event may include the following: name, Date of Birth, drivers license or state ID number, payment card information, financial account information, health insurance information, limited medical information, passport number, and Social Security number. There is no evidence this information was accessed by the unknown actor and Northshore is providing notice in an abundance of caution.

Notice to Washington Residents

On or about March 13, 2020, Northshore provided preliminary notice of this event to impacted current and former employees via email. A copy of the preliminary email communication is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

On or about April 1, 2020, Northshore began mailing written notice of this incident to all affected individuals for whom it had sufficient address information, which includes approximately four hundred eighty-three (483) Washington residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit B.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, Northshore moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of Northshore's email environment, and notify potentially affected individuals. Northshore is providing individuals with information accessible within the account access to two (2) years of complimentary credit monitoring services through ID Experts.

Northshore is also working to review existing policies and procedures. Additionally, Northshore is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank.

Northshore is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Northshore also reported this incident to Federal law enforcement and is cooperating as necessary.

Contact Information

Re: Notification of Data Security Incident

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>:

I am writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. As a solo practitioner, I take the privacy and security of your information very seriously. This is why I am contacting you, offering you complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services, and informing you about steps you can take to help protect your personal information.

What Happened?

On December 4, 2019, I learned that the personal information of some of my clients contained in my business email account was potentially exposed to an unauthorized user. This discovery was made during the course of an ongoing independent digital forensics investigation. With the assistance of cybersecurity experts, I conducted a thorough review of the information that may have been affected. We then worked diligently to identify up-to-date address information in order to notify all potentially impacted individuals, which was completed on March 12, 2020. While I am unaware of any evidence indicating that anyone's information has been misused as a result of this incident, I am providing this letter to you to inform you of the incident and provide steps you can take to further protect your personal information.

What Information Was Involved?

In addition, I took affirmative steps to minimize the likelihood of a similar incident occurring in the future. This includes working with cybersecurity experts to enhance the security of the firm's digital environment. Further, I have notified the three major consumer reporting agencies of the incident.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear [Recipient],

Natures Way Brands, LLC (Natures Way) is writing to inform you of an incident that may affect the security of some of your personal information. This notice provides information about the incident, Natures Ways response, and resources available to you, including complimentary credit monitoring services, to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

Natures Way discovered suspicious activity related to an attempted wire fraud related to a routine payment. Natures Way immediately began an internal investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. Working with third party forensic investigators, Natures Way determined that an unknown actor may have gained access to a limited number of employee email accounts from August 20, 2019 through November 13, 2019 as a result of a phishing email campaign. The investigation was unable to determine if any specific email or attachment were actually viewed. Natures Way, therefore, undertook a comprehensive review of the contents of the accounts to identify personal information that could potentially be accessible. Through this review, on or about January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that some of your personal information was present in an affected account at the time of the incident.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation determined that some of your personal information was present in an affected account at the time of the incident including your name and [unspecified information]. To date, Natures Way is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

What We Are Doing.

Natures Way takes this incident and the security of personal information in its care seriously.

Natures Ways response included resetting relevant account passwords, reviewing the contents of the accounts to determine whether they contained protected information, and reviewing internal systems to identify contact information for purposes of providing notice to potentially affected individuals. As part of Natures Ways ongoing commitment to the security of information Natures Way is also reviewing existing policies, procedures and existing security measures.

Natures Way notified law enforcement of this incident and is notifying relevant state and federal regulators. Natures Way is offering you access to complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services for 24 months through Experian.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear Sample A. Sample,

We are writing to inform you of a recent incident involving unauthorized access to some of our employees' email accounts. While we have no indication that your personal information has been misused, some of your information may have been in an email account that was accessed in this incident. We are writing to make you aware of our current understanding of what happened, measures that have been taken, and to provide you with some steps you can take to protect your personal information.

What happened?

On February 25, 2020, Spinrite, Inc. (Spinrite) learned that an unauthorized party gained access to employee email accounts through a phishing attack. We immediately initiated an investigation and retained a leading computer security firm. During the course of the investigation, we learned that unauthorized connections were made to a limited number of Spinrite email accounts between November 29, 2019, and February 25, 2020. We were unable to confirm whether any specific emails or attachments stored within those affected accounts were viewed or acquired as a result of this incident. Out of an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails stored in the affected email accounts to determine whether any of those emails contained personal information. We completed our review of the email accounts on March 23, 2020.

What information was involved?

We have determined that some of your personal information provided to Spinrite or to our affiliate Coats & Clark, Inc., was present in an affected email account, including some of the following information: first name, last name, [Extra1]. To date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

What we are doing?

As soon as we learned of this situation, we immediately launched an investigation and retained a leading computer security firm. We took steps to block unauthorized users from connecting to the affected email accounts, reset the relevant passwords, reviewed the contents of the documents in the email accounts to determine whether they contained personal information, and took additional measures to prevent unauthorized users from accessing employees' email accounts in the future. Based on our current investigation, we believe this incident was limited to the affected email accounts and did not impact our systems.

What you can do?

Although we do not have any evidence that your information has been misused, we recommend that you review the information provided in the enclosed Further Information and Steps You Can Take. The enclosure identifies some steps you can take to guard against the misuse of your personal information. Never provide personal information in a response to an electronic communication about a data security incident. Additionally, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing identity theft protection services through a one-year Experian IdentityWorks Membership at no cost to you.

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts:

There are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies.

Credit Freezes:

You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.

There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com

TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com

Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

To request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)

2. Social Security number

3. Date of birth

4. If you have moved in the past five years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years

5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill

6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.)

7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft

The credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security freeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number ("PIN") or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. To lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a security freeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through	The breach at Stockdale Radiology was a ransomware attack by an unknown intruder, resulting in the exposure of personal health information including names, addresses, and social security numbers.

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

TigerChef recently discovered an incident that may affect the security of some of your personal information. We write to provide you with information on the incident, steps TigerChef is taking in response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is appropriate.

What Happened?

On October 22, 2019, TigerChef received notice that Visa identified 46 cards that may have been compromised as the result of being used on the TigerChef website. TigerChef immediately began an investigation. While the exact nature of the potential exposure could not be confirmed, TigerChef had discovered suspicious code on its checkout page on September 9, 2019. TigerChef removed that code on September 10, 2019, and at that time there was no evidence of payment card compromise. However, it has been determined that this code may have captured card information. The unidentified code was on the checkout page of the TigerChef website beginning on July 17, 2019 until September 10, 2019, and any cards used during that time frame may be at risk. On January 3, 2020, TigerChef confirmed the identities of the individuals who made purchases during this time frame.

What Information Was Involved?

We confirmed that you used a payment card on the TigerChef website during the window of compromise. As a result, information entered onto the site could have been captured. This may include your name and credit card information.

What We Are Doing.

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. TigerChef has strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon learning of this incident, we quickly took steps to confirm the security of our systems. TigerChef began monitoring the back end setting that had previously been changed. In addition, TigerChef implemented the iField framework, which adds extra layers of protection.

In an abundance of caution, we are notifying potentially affected individuals, including you, so that you may take further steps to best protect your personal information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What You Can Do.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information to learn more about ways to protect your personal information.

For More Information.

We understand that you may have questions about this incident that are not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please contact 1-833-968-1685 (toll-free) Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. TigerChef takes the privacy and security of personal information seriously. We sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern this incident has caused you.

Sincerely,

TigerChef

Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Personal Information

Monitor Your Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report. You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.);
7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened?
On or about March 9, 2020, an unknown third party accessed employee payroll information after having gained access to an employee's email address. The third party was able to set up rules in the employee's email that diverted the employee's email messages to the third party. We wanted to inform you about this incident as soon as possible to allow you to take precautionary steps to further protect your personal information.

What Information Was Involved?
This incident involved your 2019 W-2 and associated information.

What We Are Doing.
We have completed full scans of company systems to identify malware and other threats to all employees in the U.S. We have determined that this incident was isolated to just one individual's network. Two-factor authentication was immediately implemented for HR, accounting, and our company executive team. We are in the process of rolling out two-factor authentication for all employees. We have also engaged an outside IT consultant, CORE BTS, to provide a full vulnerability assessment and recommendations concerning our systems.

We are happy to provide you with LifeLock Defender Preferred identity theft prevention and mitigation services at no cost to you for a period of 12 months. Please contact customer service at 800-899-0180 to take advantage of this offer.

What You Can Do.
We recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company that maintains the account. We also advise you to report any fraudulent activity or suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). To file a complaint with the FTC, go to www.identitytheft.gov or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations.

Additionally, we advise you to periodically check your credit report. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the FTC recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Thieves may hold stolen information to use at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly. You can obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months at http://www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling the toll-free number 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service at P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. Alternatively, you may purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of three national credit reporting agencies.

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report or obtaining a free security freeze. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 1 year. You can renew it after one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name or changing your existing accounts. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. A security freeze will prevent potential lenders from accessing your credit report, and your credit report will only be accessible by unfreezing the account. To obtain more information on placing a fraud alert on your credit report or obtaining a security freeze, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above or the FTC. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Additional free resources on how to avoid identity theft are available from the FTC at http://www.identitytheft.gov, by phone at 877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338), or by mail to Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20580.

What Oxfam Is Doing To Address This Situation

While Oxfam is not aware of and has not received any reports of the access or misuse of your personal information, it has taken the appropriate steps to ensure that your sensitive information has been secured. Oxfam is also conducting a thorough investigation into any unauthorized access of your personal information that may have occurred.

As a result of the potential unauthorized access of personal information, Oxfam will provide you, if you wish, with access to identity monitoring services provided by InfoArmor, an Allstate Company, at no charge for two years.

What You Can Do To Address This Situation

A security freeze prohibits a credit-reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer's credit report without written authorization.

To place a security freeze on your credit report, you must contact each of the three major consumer reporting agencies: Equifax (www.equifax.com); Experian (www.experian.com); and Trans Union (www.transunion.com):

The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (PIN) or password, or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze.

To lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you must call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by a secure electronic means or mail and include proper identification (name, address, and social security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identities of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. The credit reporting agencies have one (1) hour after receiving your request by telephone or secure electronic means or three (3) business days after receiving your request by mail to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time.

[Patient address]

Notice of Data Breach

April [_____], 2020

Dear [Patient name],

We value you as a patient, and we would like to thank you for allowing us to assist you with your healthcare needs. Unfortunately, a breach of your health information occurred when a former employee accessed your electronic medical record without your authorization and potentially downloaded your information. This letter is meant to inform you of the event, what we are doing, and what you can do to protect yourself.

What Happened?

On March 11, 2020, our office was performing a routine audit when we noticed that a former employee, who quit on March 2, 2020, had accessed our electronic medical record system after she had quit. Her access was revoked on March 3, 2020. Upon discovery, the office immediately performed a thorough audit to determine what information she viewed. While we do not know if she retained your medical information, through an audit of her activity we believe she may have downloaded your medical information. The employee believed she was authorized to access your information in order to file a report with a regulatory agency. Out of an abundance of caution, we are informing you of this event.

What Information Was Involved?

While we cannot confirm with certainty what information the former employee may have viewed, we believe she may have viewed your name, date of birth, medical record number, address, telephone number, demographic information, dates of service, email address, brief description of reason for each encounter at our office, treating physicians, referring physicians, past and current diagnoses, active medications, active medical issues, social security number, emergency contact information, insurance information, examination results, consult notes, sexual history, mental health history, family history, treatment plans, and charges to date. The employee confirmed in a signed declaration that she destroyed any personal information in her possession she obtained from this incident.

What We Are Doing?

As a safeguard, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for one year provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To enroll in this service, go to the myTrueIdentity website at www.mytrueidentity.com and in the space referenced as Enter Activation Code, enter the following 12-letter Activation Code [fill in for each patient] and follow the three steps to receive your credit monitoring service online within minutes. You can sign up for the online credit monitoring service anytime between now and July 31, 2020. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. Please note that credit monitoring service might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with TransUnion, Experian and Equifax, or an address in the United States (or its territories) and a valid Social Security number. Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

Once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain one year of unlimited access to your TransUnion credit report and credit score. The daily three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at TransUnion, Experian and Equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address and more. The service also includes access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (Policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

If you believe you may be a victim of identity theft, please call the toll-free TransUnion Fraud Response Services hotline at 1-855-288-5422. When prompted, enter the following 6-digit telephone pass code 697871 to speak to a TransUnion representative about your identity theft issue.

What You Can Do?

While the former employee stated that she destroyed any personal information in her possession, it is wise to monitor your credit and request a free credit report from major credit-reporting agencies, such as Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion. You may contact Equifax at 1-800-685-1111 or equifax.com; Experian at 1-888-397-3742 or experian.com; or TransUnion at 1-800-916-8800 or transunion.com. You may also request your credit report at www.AnnualCreditReport.com. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the FTC recommends that you check your credit reports periodically.

For More Information.

Again, we would like to emphasize to you our sincerest apology for this occurrence. We take patient privacy and data security very seriously, and we will ensure no similar event occurs in the future. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need any additional information or have any questions. Our address is listed above, and our phone number is (619) 420-0201.

Notice of Security Incident

Dear [Recipient],

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. For this reason, we are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident.

What happened?

On March 13, 2020, ExecuPharm experienced a data security incident that compromised select corporate and personnel information. Specifically, unknown individuals encrypted ExecuPharm servers and sought a ransom in exchange for decryption. As part of this incident, ExecuPharm employees received phishing emails from the unknown individuals. Upon a thorough investigation, ExecuPharm determined that the individuals behind the encryption and the sending of these emails may have accessed and/or shared select personal information relating to ExecuPharm personnel, as well as personal information relating to select personnel of Parexel, whose information was stored on ExecuPharm's data network. ExecuPharm has notified federal and local law enforcement authorities in the United States and retained leading third-party cybersecurity firms to investigate the nature and scope of the incident. ExecuPharm is also in the process of notifying the relevant authorities as required.

What information was involved?

We believe the individuals behind this data security incident may have accessed employee files. As a result, the information that may have been involved includes: social security numbers, taxpayer ID/EIN, driver's license numbers, passport numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, national insurance numbers, national ID numbers, IBAN/SWIFT numbers, and beneficiary information (including social security numbers). For information about what was contained in your employee file, please contact: employeeinquiries@execupharm.com. Unauthorized access to such information may potentially lead to the misuse of your personal data to impersonate you and/or to commit, or allow third parties to commit, fraudulent acts such as securing credit in your name.

What we are doing.

ExecuPharm internal teams worked diligently with forensic consultants to rebuild the impacted servers from backup servers and have now fully restored and secured the ExecuPharm systems. This included the installation of forensic tools on all systems and the isolation of impacted systems until ExecuPharm could confirm that they were secure. ExecuPharm also implemented additional countermeasures to block further ransomware emails from entering the ExecuPharm environment. ExecuPharm also upgraded its security measures to prevent future attacks, including forced password resets, multi-factor authentication for remote access, and endpoint protection, detection, and response tools.

Additionally, to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have potentially sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, a Current Credit Report, Web Watcher, Public Persona, Quick Cash Scan, $1 Million Identity Fraud Loss Reimbursement, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration. Visit https://enroll.idheadquarters.com to activate and take advantage of your identity monitoring services. You have until July 31, 2020, to activate your identity monitoring services. If you have already activated these services, no further action on identity monitoring services is required, though we encourage you to review the Additional Resources section below for further steps you can take to help protect yourself.

This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

Security Freeze
In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.

Additionally, if you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency there may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift, or remove the security freeze; however, this fee may be less in certain states (in MA, up to $5). In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency.

Subject: Notice of Data Breach

Dear SALUTATION:

As the former service provider for your 401K retirement plan with KDW Automotive, Wells Fargo is writing on behalf of KDW Automotive to inform you of an incident Wells Fargo experienced that may affect the security of your personal information. We apologize for any concern this may cause and take this matter seriously. Below, we've provided information about the incident and resources available to you to help protect your information.

What happened?

On December 23rd, 2019, Wells Fargo learned that an email, which included a file with some of your personal information intended for your current 401K service provider, was mistakenly sent to another financial institution and one of our business customers on November 6, 2019. Upon discovering the error, the recipients notified Wells Fargo and confirmed deleting the information. We have no evidence that any of the information has been misused. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, we want to make you aware of the incident.

We are offering you a complimentary two-year subscription to Experian IdentityWorksSM, a credit monitoring and identity theft protection service provided by Experian.

Tips to Safeguard Personal Information

Protecting your accounts:

Monitor your account statements often (even daily in online banking) to review all charges and transactions. Contact us immediately at 1-800-TO-WELLS (1-800-869-3557) 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week, if you see discrepancies or unauthorized activity on your Wells Fargo accounts. We will carefully review them for reimbursement in accordance with our policies.

If available, consider placing password protection on your Wells Fargo accounts, and do not use any part of your social security number as the username or password. To find out if password protection is available for your accounts, visit any Wells Fargo branch. Or we can help you close these accounts and transfer the money to new accounts. For this option, please call us at 1-800-TO-WELLS (1-800-869-3557), 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week, or visit any Wells Fargo branch.

For more tips on how to protect your Wells Fargo accounts, please visit www.wellsfargo.com/privacy_security

Do not write down or share your Personal Identification Number (PIN) number or passwords with anyone. If you receive suspicious emails that claim to be from Wells Fargo, forward them to reportphish@wellsfargo.com and then delete them.

If you have accounts at other financial institutions, please notify them and they can advise you on additional steps to take.

If your user name or email address, with a password or security question and answer that would permit access to an online account were involved, promptly change your user name or password and security question or answer, as applicable, or take other appropriate steps to protect online accounts for which you use the same user name or email address and password or security question and answer.

Protecting your identity:

Place a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. Call any one of the three major credit bureaus listed on the back of this page. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. This provides a significant layer of protection; however, it may limit your ability to get instant credit such as the offers often available at retail branches.

Check your credit report to ensure all your information is correct. You can obtain a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus every 12 months by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com or calling 1-877-322-8228.

If you believe you are a victim of identity theft, report it to your local law enforcement agency and to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your state Attorney General.

You also may want to consider placing a freeze on your credit file. A credit freeze means potential creditors cannot get your credit report and makes it less likely that an identity thief can open new accounts in your name. To place a freeze on your credit you can contact the nationwide credit bureaus. You can freeze your credit for free, but you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze. To lift the freeze, you will need to contact the credit bureaus again.

Information on how to contact the major credit bureaus, the FTC and Attorneys General can be found on the back of this page.

SVCF discovered that this shared mailbox may or could have been accessed by an unauthorized user.

What information was involved:

As a result of the incident, it was discovered that some of your personal information, specifically your name, address, photo, passport photo and number, drivers license number, and/or school records, among other information, may have been contained within the shared inbox.

Re: Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We represent Volusion, LLC (Volusion), an e-commerce platform that hosts websites for online merchants, with regard to a recent data security incident described in greater detail below. This letter is being sent on behalf of Volusion because personal information belonging to Iowa residents may have been affected by a recent data security incident.

1. Nature of the security incident.

On or about October 8, 2019, Volusion learned that personal information of some customers of Volusions merchant clients may have been improperly exposed as a result of malware placed on Volusions e-commerce platform. Immediately after learning this, Volusion took steps to secure their platform, removed the malware, notified the FBI, began an investigation and hired independent cybersecurity experts to assist with that investigation. On March 20, 2020, following a thorough independent investigation, Volusion confirmed that personal information input by some customers of Volusions merchant clients may have been improperly exposed while making purchases on the merchant clients websites between September 7, 2019 and October 8, 2019. The information may have included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, credit card numbers, CVVs, and expiration dates.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

Approximately 4,020 residents of Iowa were affected by this incident. Volusion will be notifying the potentially affected Iowa residents on or about April 20, 2020. A sample copy of the notification communication is being provided with this correspondence. In addition, Volusion is notifying statewide media and posting notice of the incident on their website.

3. Steps taken relating to the incident.

In addition to the steps discussed above, Volusion updated its internal procedures based on the findings of the investigation and added additional safeguards to minimize the chance that an incident like this could occur in the future.

4. Contact information.

Volusion remains dedicated to protecting the personal information in its control. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at (214) 722-7141 or by e-mail at lindsay.nickle@lewisbrisbois.com. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Very truly yours,

Dear Attorney General Rosenblum:

We represent KandyPens, Inc. (KandyPens) with respect to a data security incident involving the potential exposure of certain personally identifiable information described in more detail below. KandyPens, located in California, is an eCommerce entity that sells vape pens and vaporizer pens. KandyPens is committed to answering any questions you may have about the data security incident, its response, and steps taken to prevent a similar incident in the future.

1. Nature of security incident. In January 2020, KandyPens became aware of suspicious activity associated with its online payment process for its e-commerce platform. KandyPens began an internal investigation and engaged an independent computer forensic firm to assist. The forensic investigators determined that an unauthorized user had gained access to our online payment platform and credit and debit card information may have been compromised. Payment card information entered between March 7, 2019, and February 13, 2020, may have been at risk. From the investigation, it appears information at risk may have included customer names, credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes or card verification codes. KandyPens then worked to obtain a list of all customers who made a purchase on its website during the relevant time. Once they obtained this list, significant efforts were expended to remove any duplicates to obtain an accurate list for notification purposes. This process was completed on April 6, 2020.

2. Number of residents affected. Five hundred sixty-four (564) Oregon residents may have been affected and were notified of the incident. A notification letter was sent to the potentially affected individuals on April 20, 2020, via regular mail (a copy of the form notification letter is enclosed).

3. Steps taken relating to the incident. KandyPens remediated the vulnerability and has increased the monitoring of its online payment system. KandyPens is currently reviewing its policies and procedures to ensure customer information is appropriately protected.

4. Contact information. KandyPens takes the security of the information in its control seriously and is committed to ensuring the information in its control is appropriately protected. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at mventrone@clarkhill.com or (312) 360-2506.

For residents of Massachusetts: It is required by state law that you are informed of your right to obtain a police report if you are a victim of identity theft.

For residents of all states: Fraud Alerts: You can place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via each credit bureau's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three credit bureaus is below. As of September 21, 2018, fraud alerts will now last one year, instead of 90 days. Fraud alerts will continue to be free, and identity theft victims can still get extended fraud alerts for seven years.

Monitoring: You should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.

Security Freeze: A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, each credit reporting agency has a dedicated web page for security freezes and fraud alerts, or you can request a freeze by phone or by mail. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well):

(1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes;

(2) Social Security number;

(3) date of birth;

(4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and

(5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles.

The request may also require a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. Effective September 21, 2018, placing a freeze on your credit report is now free for all United States citizens.

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to provide notification of an incident at Lincoln Savings Bank that may affect the security of personal information of six thousand seven hundred and seventy-four (6,774) Iowa residents. Lincoln Savings Bank's investigation is ongoing, and this notification will be supplemented with new or significant facts or findings subsequent to this submission, if any.

Lincoln Savings Bank learned that a limited number of employee email accounts may have been compromised by an email phishing attack resulting in unauthorized access to the email boxes. Upon learning of the issue, Lincoln Savings Bank immediately secured the accounts and commenced a prompt and thorough investigation.

After an extensive forensic investigation and manual email review, Lincoln Savings Bank discovered on March 19, 2020, that the impacted email accounts that were accessed between October 3, 2019, and December 19, 2019, contained personal information belonging to a limited number of individuals. The impacted data includes the affected residents' Social Security Numbers; driver license numbers or other unique identification numbers (such as U.S. alien registration numbers or passport numbers); medical treatment information, Medicare/Medicaid numbers, and/or financial account number or credit card number or debit card number.

Out of an abundance of caution, Lincoln Savings Bank wanted to inform you (and the affected residents) of the incident and to explain the steps that it is taking to help safeguard the affected residents against identity fraud. Lincoln Savings Bank is providing the affected residents with written notification of this incident commencing on or about April 17, 2020, in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto.

Lincoln Savings Bank is offering all the Iowa residents whose SSNs were impacted a one-year membership in Experian IdentityWorks Credit 3B at its own expense in order to protect them against identity theft. Lincoln Savings Bank is also advising the affected residents about the process for placing fraud alerts and/or security freezes on their credit files and obtaining free credit reports. The affected residents are also being provided with the contact information for the consumer reporting agencies, the Iowa attorney general's office, and the Federal Trade Commission.

At Lincoln Savings Bank, protecting the privacy of personal information is a top priority. Since learning of the incident, Lincoln Savings Bank has implemented enhanced security safeguards to help protect against similar intrusions. Lincoln Savings Bank is also conducting ongoing monitoring of its network to ensure that it is secure and cleared of any malicious activity.

Re: Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Rosenblum:

We represent Volusion, LLC (Volusion), an e-commerce platform that hosts websites for online merchants, with regard to a recent data security incident described in greater detail below. This letter is being sent on behalf of Volusion because personal information belonging to Oregon residents may have been affected by a recent data security incident.

1. Nature of the security incident.

On or about October 8, 2019, Volusion learned that personal information of some customers of Volusions merchant clients may have been improperly exposed as a result of malware placed on Volusions e-commerce platform. Immediately after learning this, Volusion took steps to secure their platform, removed the malware, notified the FBI, began an investigation and hired independent cybersecurity experts to assist with that investigation. On March 20, 2020, following a thorough independent investigation, Volusion confirmed that personal information input by some customers of Volusions merchant clients may have been improperly exposed while making purchases on the merchant clients websites between September 7, 2019 and October 8, 2019. The information may have included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, credit card numbers, CVVs, and expiration dates.

2. Number of Oregon residents affected.

Approximately 7,395 residents of Oregon were affected by this incident. Volusion will be notifying the potentially affected Oregon residents on or about April 20, 2020. A sample copy of the notification communication is being provided with this correspondence. In addition, Volusion is notifying statewide media and posting notice of the incident on their website.

3. Steps taken relating to the incident.

In addition to the steps discussed above, Volusion updated its internal procedures based on the findings of the investigation and added additional safeguards to minimize the chance that an incident like this could occur in the future.

4. Contact information.

Volusion remains dedicated to protecting the personal information in its control. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at (214) 722-7141 or by e-mail at lindsay.nickle@lewisbrisbois.com. Please let me know if you have any questions.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

A.B. Closing, Inc. D/B/A Kavaliro (Kavaliro) recently discovered a data security incident that involved the compromise of certain Kavaliro business email and file sharing systems. This notice is being provided as a precaution to inform potentially affected individuals about the incident and to provide some steps that can be taken to help protect themselves.

This notification has not been delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation, and we sincerely regret any concern this notification may cause you.

What Happened:
In March 2020, Kavaliro became aware of unauthorized persons who were using an imposter domain name to conduct email phishing directed at Kavaliro's customers. Kavaliro has since had the imposter domain taken down, and while investigating the imposter domain, on March 26, 2020, became aware of unauthorized access to several Kavaliro email accounts by those involved with the imposter domain. On April 11, 2020, Kavaliro was able to determine that there was also unauthorized access to multiple additional Kavaliro email accounts, as well as certain internal file management systems.

Kavaliro is unable to determine the specific time and date that the unauthorized access began or the exact number of affected individuals, but Kavaliro believes the unauthorized access began with two accounts in September 2019 and expanded to multiple accounts in March 2020. The unauthorized access continued through March 29, 2020.

What Information Was Involved:
The email accounts and file sharing systems at issue may have contained personally identifiable information present in the email accounts or internal file management systems at Kavaliro, including but not limited to names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, usernames, passwords, financial account information, and certain demographic information.

What We Are Doing:
Kavaliro takes privacy very seriously and deeply regrets this incident. After Kavaliro learned of this incident, it initiated a comprehensive IT security investigation and hired an independent forensic cybersecurity investigation firm to assist in its investigation and response. Kavaliro also notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and will continue to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation.

Kavaliro enabled multi-factor authentication on its business systems, blocked certain foreign IP addresses, conducted global password resets, and is working continually to harden its information security infrastructure and technological practices to better prevent any future unauthorized access to its information systems.

As a precaution, and to reduce the risk that any client information could be misused, Kavaliro is offering potentially impacted individuals one year of identity monitoring services at no cost through Kroll, to include Credit Monitoring, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data. The offer is available to potentially affected individuals whose information may have been in Kavaliro's compromised accounts at any time between September 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. Qualifying individuals can learn more or request membership information by calling the call center at 844-978-2448. Once a membership number is received, you will receive activation instructions by mail and have until July 23, 2020, to activate your identity monitoring services. Additional information describing Kroll's services is included below in the Additional Resources section.

What You Can Do:
For tips on how to help protect yourself, please review the Additional Resources reference guide included below. This section includes steps you may wish to take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection, monitoring account statements and free credit reports, and details on placing a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.

For More Information:
For more information about this incident, or if you have additional questions or concerns, you may contact our dedicated call center directly at 844-978-2448 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time, excluding major US holidays. Again, we sincerely regret any concern this incident may cause you.

Additional Resources
Review Accounts and Credit Reports: You can also regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by mailing an Annual Credit Report Request Form (available at www.annualcreditreport.com) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA, 30348-5281. You may also purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one or more of the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.

You should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You may contact the FTC or your state's regulatory authority to obtain additional information about preventing identity theft: Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft. North Carolina residents may also contact the North Carolina Attorney General's Office: 9001 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, North Carolina 27699; 1-877-5-NO-SCAM; https://www.ncdoj.gov/protectingconsumers/.

Fraud Alerts: There are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed at the bottom of this page.

Credit Freezes: You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent and shall be provided free of charge. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since laws may differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information.

You can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the FTC or one of the national credit reporting agencies listed below.

Dear ___________:

We recently learned that PaperlessPay Corporation (PaperlessPay), the owner and operator of eStubview and a third-party vendor of Spencer Municipal Hospital (the Hospital), was subjected to a data security incident as the result of a cyberattack (the Incident). This vendor supplies the website for your online access to bi-weekly payroll checkstub information and the annual IRS W-2 Forms. We are writing to inform you that some of your personal information may have been subject to unauthorized access or acquisition as the result of that Incident. This information was maintained by the Hospital, and subsequently the vendor, in connection with your current or former employment. While we are not aware of any misuse of your information, we are providing this notice to inform you of the Incident and to call your attention to steps you can take to help protect yourself and your personal information.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and assure you that we have worked diligently to resolve this matter and continue to deploy measures to avoid these types of incidents from occurring in the future. Below you will also find instructions and a code redeemable for one year of credit monitoring with Experian, which the Hospital is making available at no cost to you.

What Happened?

On April 9, 2020, the Hospital was informed that your personal information may have been accessible to an unauthorized actor as a result of the Incident. Based on the investigation, it appears the Incident occurred at the vendor sometime on or before February 18, 2020. We have no reason to believe that any of the Hospitals systems were compromised, the Incident only occurred on the systems of this third-party vendor.

The Hospital also worked with PaperlessPay to determine what information may have been at risk. The Hospital will notify you if it becomes aware of any significant developments. As mentioned, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are aware of the Incident. This communication was not delayed at the request of law enforcement. As an added precaution, we have arranged for credit monitoring and identity restoration services to be provided to you by Experian at no cost to you.

What You Should Do To Protect Your Personal Information

We recommend you remain vigilant and consider taking one or more of the following steps to avoid identity theft, obtain additional information, and protect your personal information:

1. Contacting the nationwide credit-reporting agencies as soon as possible to:

- Add a fraud alert statement to your credit file at all three national credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. This statement alerts creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. Once the fraud alert is added to your credit report, all creditors should contact you prior to establishing any account in your name. You only need to contact one of the three agencies listed below; your request will be shared with the other two agencies. This fraud alert will remain on your credit file for 90 days.
- Place a security freeze on your credit account. This means that your credit account cannot be shared with potential creditors. A security freeze can help prevent new account identity theft. If you would like to request a security freeze be placed on your account, you must write by certified or overnight mail (see addresses below) to each of the three credit reporting agencies, or through the electronic or Internet method made available by the credit reporting agencies.
- Remove your name from mailing lists of pre-approved offers of credit for approximately six months.
- Receive a free copy of your credit report by going to www.annualcreditreport.com.

At Community Memorial Health System (CMHS), we value our employees and protecting your personal information is our priority. We are writing to let you know about a data security incident involving your personal information.

What Happened?

We were notified by PaperlessPay Corporation (PaperlessPay) in a letter dated March 20, 2020, that on February 19, 2020, they were contacted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding a possible breach of their systems. PaperlessPay is a vendor hired by CMHS to house pay stubs and assist with W-2 forms. DHS notified PaperlessPay that there was an unknown person purporting to sell access to their client database on the dark web. In response, PaperlessPay shut down their web server and SQL server to prevent potential unauthorized access. During this time, CMHS and its employees experienced an interruption in service for a short amount of time while their servers were offline.

Over the following weeks, PaperlessPay cooperated with the joint investigation conducted by DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In addition, PaperlessPay retained a cybersecurity firm to help with their own internal forensic investigation of the incident. Through these investigations, PaperlessPay confirmed that the unauthorized person gained access to their SQL server, where data is stored, on February 18, 2020. The available evidence has not, however, allowed DHS, the FBI, or the security firm to determine what data the person may have accessed or viewed while connected to the SQL server.

What Information Was Involved?

The impacted server stored pay stub and tax forms that contain name, address, pay and withholdings information, bank account number information (if this appears on your paystub), and Social Security number. With respect to bank account information, note that bank information for employees who receive a single deposit was not provided to PaperlessPay. Bank account information is, however, provided for those employees who receive multiple deposits. Specifically, for multiple deposit employees, PaperlessPay would have had access to a full bank account number for each account that is being deposited, but not to bank account routing numbers or bank names.

What Are We Doing?

Following notice of this incident, we have been working with PaperlessPay to understand the full scope of the incident and to ensure that CMHS information is secure moving forward. These conversations will be ongoing, but we are able to report that PaperlessPay has taken several steps to improve the security of their systems.

Though we can't be certain if the incident exposed your personal information, we believe in taking every precaution here. Therefore, CMHS has arranged for affected individuals to register for identity theft protection and credit monitoring services for one year at no cost to the employee through Experian's IdentityWorksSM, as described in more detail below.

What You Can Do.

As a precautionary measure, and as noted in our email to you on April 15, 2020, we have asked PaperlessPay to reset all passwords and we recommend that you change the password/access information for your payroll account. Additionally, and as always, please remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Some detailed steps for you to consider are as follows:

You may put a credit freeze (or security freeze) on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Credit freeze laws vary from state to state, but there is no cost anywhere in the country for freezing or unfreezing your credit file. You must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company, and may need to provide the following information: (1) full name, middle initial and any suffixes; (2) social security number; (3) complete addresses for past 2 years; (4) date of birth; (5) a copy of a government-issued identification card; (6) proof of your current address (such as a utility bill or telephone bill); and (7) proof of your identity (such as a copy of your Social Security card, pay stub with social security number, or W2 or 1099 form).

As a reminder, it is always a good practice to remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports from one or more of the national credit reporting agencies above, and to promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Dear [Employee Name],

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened?

Marshall Medical Center (MMC) uses an outside vendor called PaperlessPay to produce electronic paystubs and W2 forms for employees. On March 20, 2020, PaperlessPay contacted MMC that on February 19, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contacted PaperlessPay that an unknown person was purporting to sell access to PaperlessPay's client database on the dark web. In response, PaperlessPay shut down its web server and database to prevent any potential unauthorized access. This interrupted services to MMC employees and prevented you from accessing payroll records for a short amount of time while the servers were offline. PaperlessPay does not have any role in the actual Direct Deposit process of paychecks, so that process was not impacted.

Over the following weeks, PaperlessPay cooperated with the joint investigation conducted by DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Their investigation is ongoing, and PaperlessPay will continue to cooperate. In addition, PaperlessPay retained the cybersecurity firm Ankura to help with its own, internal forensic investigation of the incident.

Through these investigations, PaperlessPay confirmed that an unknown person (the Hacker) on February 18, 2020, accessed PaperlessPay's database where MMC employees' data was stored. The available evidence has not, however, allowed DHS, the FBI, or Ankura to determine what data the Hacker may have accessed or viewed while connected to the database. It is possible the Hacker only used access to determine the size of the database and to stage it for subsequent access that could be sold to others, and that the Hacker did not directly access any employee data.

The security system also has an alert system that is configured to detect data file transfers that exceed 1GB in size, and no alert was triggered during this security incident event. However, the Hacker would have had the capability to run queries against the database and view its data, so we cannot rule out the possibility of unauthorized access or acquisition.

What Information Was Involved?

The information stored in PaperlessPay's database regarding MMC employees consists of the data elements that appear on employee pay stubs and tax forms, including name, address, pay and withholdings, and Social Security number. However, these data elements are stored on the database in different tables that are associated by user ID numbers, not names, within each database table. Therefore, the only way to associate any data with an individual would be to run a query against the database and have it aggregate an individual's name with his or her other data components.

What We Are Doing.

PaperlessPay has acted to secure their network and prevent future incidents. To resume their services, PaperlessPay rebuilt a new domain controller, a new web server, and a new database server to start with a clean slate. Furthermore, PaperlessPay then restored database files to the new database server from backups. New IP addresses were assigned to all the new servers, and passwords for users and administrators were changed. These actions forced all clients to change their passwords when they log in for the first time and disabled all remote access capabilities to the new web server and database server.

PaperlessPay also installed an endpoint detection and response (EDR) application called Carbon Black on the new servers and other endpoints within its network. This has allowed PaperlessPay to monitor all activity while it completed its investigation of the incident. To date since Carbon Black has been running, there have been no indicators of compromise detected in the newly rebuilt environment, and PaperlessPay has reported that all customer services are functioning as normal.

Based on the information PaperlessPay has shared with MMC about this event, MMC has decided to stop sending any more information to this vendor going forward. The previous data for estubs and W2s will still be available through the PaperlessPay portal until we determine a better method for access. For a period of time, MMC will be going back to producing paper paystubs until we can go live on our new payroll system. MMC has purchased a new payroll system through a company called Workday and is building this system for go-live this fall. The new payroll system will have an employee portal where employees will be able to access their paystubs and W2 and will be included in the overall business system for the organization.

What You Can Do.

There are additional actions you can consider taking to reduce the chances of identity theft or fraud on your account(s).

ADDITIONAL ACTIONS TO HELP REDUCE YOUR CHANCES OF IDENTITY THEFT

- Place a 90-Day Fraud Alert on Your Credit file: An initial 90-day security alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a victim of fraud. When you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit on an existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the lender should take steps to verify that you have authorized the request. If the creditor cannot verify this, the request should not be satisfied. You may contact one of the credit reporting companies below for assistance.

Equifax 1-800-525-6285 www.equifax.com

Experian 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com

TransUnion 1-800-680-7289 www.transunion.com

- PLACE A SECURITY FREEZE ON YOUR CREDIT FILE: If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, a security freeze might be right for you. Placing a freeze on your credit report will prevent lenders and others from accessing your credit report entirely, which will prevent them from extending credit. With a Security Freeze in place, you will be required to take special steps when you wish to apply for any type of credit. This process is also completed through each of the credit reporting companies.
- Order Your Free Annual Credit Reports: Visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 877-322-8228. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.
- MANAGE your personal information: Take steps such as carrying only essential documents with you, being aware of whom you are sharing your personal information with, and shredding receipts, statements, and other sensitive information.
- USE TOOLS FROM CREDIT PROVIDERS: Carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card, and other account statements. Be proactive and create alerts on credit cards and bank accounts to notify you of activity. If you discover unauthorized or suspicious activity on your credit report or by any other means, file an identity theft report with your local police and contact a credit reporting company.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

McKissock Investment Holdings, LLC (McKissock), affiliated with McKissock, LLC, writes to notify you of a recent incident that may affect the security of some of your personal information. While there is currently no evidence that your information has been misused as a result of this incident, we are providing you with information about the incident, our response to it, and information related to what you may do to better protect your personal information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

McKissock became aware of unusual activity relating to certain McKissock systems and immediately began an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic investigators. The investigation determined that a certain legacy virtual server was accessed without authorization between November 16, 2019, and March 4, 2020. While the investigation did not determine that personal information had been viewed by an unauthorized actor, McKissock could not rule out the possibility of such activity. Therefore, McKissock immediately began a thorough review of the contents of the server to determine whether sensitive information was present at the time of the incident. On or about March 26, 2020, McKissock determined that your personal information was present on the affected server at the time of the incident. To date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that at the time of the incident the server contained information including your name and driver's license or state identification number.

What Are We Doing?

Information, privacy, and security are among our highest priorities. McKissock has strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon learning of this incident, we quickly took steps to investigate and confirm the security of our systems, and in an abundance of caution, we quickly disabled access to the affected server. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information, we implemented increased security measures, conducted additional employee training, and are currently reviewing our policies and procedures relating to data security. Additionally, we are also providing relevant regulatory notices. While, to date, we have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information as a result of this incident, we are notifying you so that you may take further steps to better protect your personal information should you feel it is appropriate to do so. We also secured the services of NortonLifeLock, Inc. to provide identity and credit monitoring services at no cost to you for twelve (12) months.
