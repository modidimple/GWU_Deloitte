Office of the Attorney General of Iowa

Des Moines, Iowa 50319-0106

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We represent Informatics, Inc. (Informatics), the website host of www.mycountyparks.com, a website maintained by Iowa's County Conservation System (ICCS), with respect to a data security incident (hereinafter, the Incident) described in more detail below. Informatics and ICCS take the security and privacy of the information in their control seriously, and have taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

1. Nature of the security incident.

On April 4, 2020, ICCS was first alerted to feedback received from several ICCS website users who discovered that fraudulent purchases were made on their payment cards after using the www.mycountyparks.com website. ICCS then quickly informed Informatics, Inc., the host of www.mycountyparks.com to investigate. On April 9, 2020, Informatics alerted ICCS that a technical investigation performed by Informatics revealed previously undiscovered evidence that an unknown individual had placed a malicious code on www.mycountyparks.com as early as January 31, 2020. The malicious code was used to intercept payment card information of www.mycountyparks.com website users who made purchases on the website between the dates of January 31, 2020, and April 8, 2020. Upon discovery, steps were taken to swiftly secure the ICCS website, such as the removal of the malicious code. At this time, ICCS and Informatics have no evidence to indicate that the attacker responsible for the attack may have viewed or otherwise acquired any personal information of consumers affected by this incident other than their name, address, and payment card information.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

Two thousand five hundred eighty (2,580) Iowa residents were potentially affected by this security incident. An incident notification letter addressed to these individuals was mailed on May 4, 2020, by first-class mail. A sample copy of the notification letter is included with this letter.

3. Steps taken.

Informatics and ICCS have taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future, and to protect the privacy and security of potentially impacted individuals' information. Those steps include strengthening its cybersecurity posture, such as the removal of the malicious code that caused the Incident, and providing potentially impacted individuals with timely notice of the Incident and complimentary identity theft restoration and credit monitoring services for a period of twelve (12) months.

4. Contact information.

Informatics and ICCS remain dedicated to protecting the sensitive information in their control. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@wilsonelser.com or (312) 821-6164.

Very truly yours,

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

The City of Fullerton (the City) is issuing this notice to inform individuals of a data privacy event that may have affected the security of personal information of some City residents and employees. The City takes this incident seriously and is providing individuals with information and resources to protect their personal information.

What Happened?

The City discovered unauthorized posts on a public website containing confidential City information. An investigation was immediately launched to identify the source of the activity and confirm the security of the network. A third-party forensic investigator was also engaged to determine the nature and scope of the event. During the investigation, it was discovered that an internal data storage account was accessed by unauthorized users on multiple occasions from 2016 through June 21, 2019. The investigation revealed that the data included copies of emails and attachments containing certain protected information. As a precaution, the entire contents of the storage account were reviewed to identify the information that may have been accessible within the account. Written notice was provided to individuals whose information was found in the data storage account. However, a small number of files present in the data storage account at the time of the access were not recovered and were unable to be reviewed.

What Information is Involved?

On October 25, 2019, written notice was provided to a small number of individuals whose sensitive information was found in the accessed data storage account. However, because a small number of files present within the data storage account were not able to be recovered, the City is providing this additional notification. The personal information that may have been present within these small number of files may include name and Social Security number, driver's license number, payment card information, medical or health information, and/or passport number. However, the City is unable to confirm the contents of these files or whether sensitive information was present in these files.

What Are We Doing?

The City takes the security of employee and citizen information seriously. The City immediately secured the account at issue, reviewed existing security measures, and is working diligently to implement additional security measures to ensure the security of the entire network. The City is also providing information about this event and about the steps individuals can take to help safeguard personal information. In addition, the City is offering identity monitoring services through Kroll.

What You Can Do?

The City encourages individuals to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review their account statements, and to monitor their credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, individuals are entitled to one (1) free credit report annually from each of the three (3) major credit reporting bureaus. To order a free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. Individuals may also contact the three (3) major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of their credit report. Individuals have the right to place a security freeze on their credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in their credit report without express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in an individual's name without consent. However, using a security freeze to control who gets access to the personal and financial information in an individual's credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, an individual cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on their credit report. Should an individual wish to place a security freeze, they should contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Re: Notice of Data [Variable Text 1]

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>:

Impact Mobile Home Communities (Impact MHC) is writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the security of some of your personal information. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, this letter provides information about the incident and the resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On July 3, 2019, Impact MHC became aware of suspicious activity relating to an employee email account. We immediately launched an investigation to determine what may have happened. Working together with a leading computer forensics firm, our investigation determined that an unauthorized individual or individuals accessed several employee email accounts between July 1, 2019, and July 31, 2019. Two of the email accounts were accessed between October 3, 2018, and July 8, 2019.

Because we were unable to determine which email messages in the accounts may have been viewed or acquired by the unauthorized actor, we reviewed the entire contents of the impacted email accounts to identify what personal information was accessible to the unauthorized actor(s). Due to the large volume of emails to be reviewed, this was a very lengthy and labor-intensive process. On February 27, 2020, we identified the individuals potentially impacted by this incident after a thorough programmatic and manual review of the email accounts. Once we confirmed the individuals who were potentially affected, Impact MHC worked to identify contact information for the impacted individuals and began preparing an accurate written notice of this incident.

What Information Was Affected?

Although we cannot confirm whether your personal information was actually accessed, viewed, or acquired without permission, we are providing you this notification out of an abundance of caution because such activity cannot be ruled out. The following types of your information were located in an email or attachment that may have been accessed or acquired by an unauthorized actor: your name and [Variable Text 2].

What Are We Doing?

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. Impact MHC has strict security measures in place to protect the information in our possession. Upon learning of this incident, we quickly changed all employee email account passwords and took steps to secure the accounts. We are currently implementing additional technical safeguards and employee training to prevent similar future incidents.

What Can You Do?

Although we are not aware of any fraudulent misuse of your information, we arranged to have ID Experts monitor your identity for 1 year at no cost to you as an added precaution. Please review the instructions contained in the attached Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information to enroll in and receive these services. Impact MHC will cover the cost of this service; however, you will need to enroll yourself in the credit monitoring service if you would like to do so.

Santa Rosa & Rohnert Park Oral Surgery (SROS/RPOS) is writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the privacy of some of your personal health information. You are receiving this letter because you are a current or former patient of, or were previously referred to, SROS/RPOS.

Monitor Your Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, promptly change any involved account passwords, and to review account statements, credit reports, and explanation of benefits forms for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear Account Holder:

The Chronicle of Higher Education, Inc. takes data security very seriously and we understand the importance of protecting the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you about an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

WHAT HAPPENED:

On May 10, 2020, The Chronicle concluded our investigation and analysis of a data security incident that involved unauthorized access to one of our servers. The Chronicle learned about the incident after receiving an internal alert about suspicious activity on the server. Upon learning of this, The Chronicle took the server offline, a leading cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with the investigation, and law enforcement was notified. Through our investigation, The Chronicle determined that unauthorized parties exploited a vulnerability in the server, through which they were able to obtain administrative account credentials for the server. The unauthorized parties then logged in to the server on February 17, 2020, and accessed a database on the server that contained credentials for online accounts to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and chroniclevitae.com.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED:

Our investigation determined that the server accessed by the unauthorized parties contained a database with your username(s) and hashed and salted password(s) for your online account(s) to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and/or chroniclevitae.com. The password(s) for your account(s) were not in plain text but had been altered through a cryptographic hashing and salting process, which rendered the actual password(s) indecipherable to third parties. Although access to the hashed and salted passwords would not allow access to your account(s), we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution because our investigation was unable to rule out the possibility that unauthorized parties could bypass the cryptographic hashing and salting process.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:

The next time you log in to your online account(s), you will be prompted to change your password(s). Also, if you use the same username(s) and password(s) for any other online account, we recommend that you change your password there as well.

WHAT WE ARE DOING:

To date, we have no evidence that there has been any unauthorized access to your online account(s), however, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. In addition to resetting the password(s) to your online accounts using stronger hashing and salting technology, we have taken steps to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, including the replacement of the server with the unauthorized access, as well as additional procedures to further expand and strengthen security processes.

FOR MORE INFORMATION:

We regret any inconvenience or concern this may cause you. If you have any questions, please contact 1-833-579-1097, Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time.

Sincerely,

Ken Sands

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident involving your personal information. At PCL, we take the protection of your information very seriously. Therefore, we are reaching out to you directly to explain the incident and provide you with steps you can take to protect yourself.

What Happened

Our third-party vendor, who assists with payroll operations, recently informed us that an unauthorized actor accessed their database that stores the personal information of current and former PCL employees. As a result, the unauthorized user may have been able to access the database that contained your personal information. However, we have no direct evidence that your personal information was misused.

Upon learning of the incident, we immediately directed our third-party vendor to remove all current and former PCL employee data from its database. The third-party vendor also began an investigation and engaged a cybersecurity and forensic firm to determine how the security incident occurred and the scope of such incident. Additionally, PCL hired a leading forensic investigation firm to conduct a search of the dark web in relation to the incident, which advised that it found no evidence of misuse of PCL employees' personal information.

What Information Was Involved

While our investigation is ongoing, we believe that the database that may have been accessed contained current and former employees' first and last names, address, personal email address, personal telephone number, pay and withholding information, and Social Security number.

What We Are Doing

We are notifying you so that you can take immediate action to protect yourself. We take the protection of your information very seriously. We conducted a thorough review of the potentially affected records and continue to review existing policies and procedures designed to prevent a similar occurrence from happening again. As mentioned, we immediately had all current and former employee data removed from the third-party vendor database. We are also notifying the appropriate regulatory authorities.

In addition, to help protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary 1-year membership of myTrueIdentity provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. This product provides you with superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft. To activate your membership and start monitoring your personal information, please follow the steps below.

May 14, 2020

Dear Claimant,

We are writing to inform you that the Department of Labor has discovered that your name and Social Security Number may have been mistakenly sent to an employer who is not associated with your unemployment claim. This was due to a processing error and not a result of any external breach of DOL data.

We have contacted all employers who received this wrong information and instructed them to destroy any SSNs they received in error. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

We want to assure you that there is no evidence of any misuse of your information at this time. However, we recommend that you closely monitor your accounts for any suspicious activity. To help you protect yourself against the risk of identity theft, we have included a checklist of suggestions with this letter.

The mailing that contained the wrongful printing of claimant names and SSNs on the backside of forms requesting information about wages paid occurred on approximately March 30, 2020. These forms were mailed by DOL to employers regarding employees who have submitted a claim for unemployment insurance benefits. Corrected forms were resent to all employers.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Cameron Wood
Unemployment Insurance Director
Vermont Department of Labor

TIPS FOR GUARDING AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT

(1) Review your bank, credit card, and debit card account statements over the next twelve to twenty-four months and immediately report any suspicious activity to your bank or credit union.

(2) Monitor your credit reports with the major credit reporting agencies:
Equifax: 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com
Experian: 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
TransUnion: 1-800-916-8800, www.transunion.com

Under Vermont law, you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report from those agencies every twelve months. Call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report if you find:
(A) Accounts you did not open;
(B) Inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate; or
(C) Inaccurate personal information, such as home address and Social Security number.

(3) If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or other account statements, call your local police or sheriff's office and file a report of identity theft. Get a copy of the police report. You may need to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up your records, and also to access some services that are free to identity theft victims.

(4) If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or on your other account statements, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit files so creditors will contact you before opening new accounts. Call any one of the three credit reporting agencies at the number below to place fraud alerts with all of the agencies:
Equifax: 888-766-08
Experian: 888-397-3742
TransUnion: 800-680-7289

(5) You may also get information about security freezes using the below addresses:

Experian: http://www.experian.com/consumer/security_freeze.html
TransUnion: https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze

If you do not have Internet access but would like to learn more about how to place a security freeze, contact the VT Attorney General's Office at 802-656-3183 (800-649-2424 toll-free in Vermont only).

(6) Even if you do not find suspicious activity on your credit report or your other account statements, it is important that you check your credit report for the next two years. Just call one of the numbers in paragraph 2 above to order your reports or to keep a fraud alert in place.

Helpful information about identity theft, security freezes, and obtaining a free copy of your credit report is available on the VT Attorney General's website: http://ago.vermont.gov/. Another helpful source is the Federal Trade Commission website: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft.

Impacted Principal Owner first and last name:

Over the last several weeks, our company has worked closely with the U.S. Treasury and Small Business Administration (SBA) to process more than 305,000 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications with the SBA, providing more than $25 billion in financial relief for small businesses in need. We are writing to advise you that in preparation for submission of loan applications to the SBA, Bank of America (the Bank) uploaded some clients' loan applications to a limited access, controlled SBA test application platform. This platform was designed to allow authorized lenders to test the process for submitting PPP applications to the SBA prior to the actual submission process.

During testing, we discovered information included in your application may have been visible for a limited time period to a limited number of other lenders and their vendors authorized by the SBA to participate in the program. There is no indication that your information was viewed or misused by these lenders or their vendors. And your information was not visible to other business clients applying for loans, or to the public, at any time. This did not affect the actual submission of PPP loan applications to the SBA.

Below we provide more detailed information for you, and respond to questions you may have.

WHAT HAPPENED:

Authorized lenders are required to submit loan applications to the SBA through the SBA's loan application platform. On April 22, the Bank uploaded some clients' loan application information to the SBA's test application platform, which authorized lenders and their vendors also use to test their loan submission processes. We quickly recognized other authorized lenders and their vendors may have had the ability to view the applicant information we uploaded. It is critical to note that there is no indication that any of the participating lenders or their vendors viewed or misused your information. The Bank requested and confirmed the removal of the information from the SBA's test website the same day. There was no impact to the submission of your loan application to the SBA.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED:

The information that may have been briefly visible to limited authorized lenders and their vendors included business contact and business information about the company of which you are a principal owner, such as business address and tax identification number (TIN). As a principal owner, personal information about you, such as your name, address, Social Security Number, phone number, email address and citizenship may have been involved.

WHAT WE ARE DOING:

Keeping your information confidential is one of our most important responsibilities. We are notifying you so we may work together to protect your personal and business information.

We have taken the following precautions:

We conducted our own internal investigations to protect and minimize any financial impact to you.

As an additional measure of protection, Bank of America has arranged for a complimentary two-year membership in an identity theft protection service provided by Experian IdentityWorks SM.

Important tips on how to protect personal information

We recommend that you take the following precautions to guard against the disclosure and unauthorized use of your account and personal information:

Review your monthly account statements thoroughly and report any suspicious activity to us.

Report lost or stolen checks, credit or debit cards immediately.

Never provide personal information over the phone or online unless you have initiated the call and know with whom you are speaking.

Do not print your driver's license or Social Security number on checks.

Safeguard ATM, credit and debit cards. Memorize PINs (personal identification numbers) and refrain from writing PINs, Social Security numbers or credit card numbers where they could be found.

Store cancelled checks, new checks and account statements in a safe place.

Reduce the amount of paper you receive containing personal information. Sign up for online statements, direct deposit and pay bills online.

Tear up or shred any pre-approved credit offers to which you do not respond.

As a general best practice, we recommended that you change (and regularly update) existing passwords and PIN numbers and monitor all your account(s) including any additional account(s) you may have with other financial institutions to prevent or detect the occurrence of any unauthorized/fraudulent activity.

Review your credit report at least once every year. Make sure all information is up to date and accurate, and have information relating to fraudulent transactions deleted. For a free copy of your credit bureau report, contact annualcreditreport.com or call 1.877.322.8228.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened?
The Student Information System of Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District had unauthorized access involving Parent and Student Data. On Tuesday May 12, 2020, the District IT department was notified that several school districts in the surrounding area had recently determined that their SIS (student information system) databases were compromised in November of 2019 through a vulnerability in the Aeries SIS software. Upon receiving this information, our IT department immediately ran security checks, reviewed logs and was able to confirm that Kingsburg Elementary Charter School Districts Student Information System database was accessed without authorization in November of 2019. Aeries, who licenses our use of the software, notified customers of the following: In late November 2019, Aeries Software became aware of unauthorized attempts to access data through the Aeries SIS Hosted platform. In response, Aeries immediately began an investigation into whether these attempts had been successful and, if so, how they had been accomplished, what impact, if any, they may have had on data, and what steps they could take to thwart future unauthorized access to data through the Aeries SIS using the same or similar means. At the time, internal investigation did not reveal any compromise of the Aeries SIS or data. Nevertheless, Aeries Software deployed a series of security patches in the December 20, 2019 version of the Aeries SIS which addressed the results of their internal investigation. Then, in late January 2020, Aeries was informed by a locally hosted District that their database may have been previously subject to unauthorized access, they had informed local authorities, and a criminal investigation was underway. Aeries now understands that the investigation by the authorities is ongoing and they are working closely with local law enforcement and federal authorities as well as the original reporting District to determine what transpired, by whom it was perpetrated, and what impact, if any, it may have had on data. In working with the original reporting District and law enforcement officials, in March 2020 Aeries was able to expand their earlier investigation with the new information as to the methods used by the individuals who had accessed data without authorization.

What Information Was Involved?
Student and Parent Internal ID number, First name, Last name, Parent/Guardian name, Residence address, Resident City, Parent/Guardian email address and password.

What We Are Doing.
While there is no evidence to suggest that your data was misused, state law mandates that we notify our families of whose data may have been subject to unauthorized access. (See Cal. Civ. Code 1798.29; see also Cal. Gov. Code 6252.) We are instituting a mandatory password reset for all parent and student accounts out of an abundance of caution. Instructions for completing the password reset will be sent to the email address on record for every impacted account. The vulnerability that allowed the data to be exploited was a bug in the Aeries Student Information System software and was patched in December 2019. We are working with Aeries, and law enforcement where appropriate. Aeries software has indicated the perpetrators have been taken into custody and the unauthorized access has been terminated.

What You Can Do.
We strongly advise all impacted users to follow the instructions being sent out via email to change their Aeries passwords immediately. If you have used your Aeries password for any other online accounts, we strongly advise you to change those passwords as well and avoid using duplicated passwords. There is nothing to suggest that any data was accessed revealing Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. Nevertheless, If you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the FTCs site at IdentityTheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Consumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations.

An unknown individual had unauthorized access to some emails from July 8, 2019, until September 22, 2019, which were discovered on August 26, 2019, and determined on April 17, 2020, that personal information may have been affected.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Organization: Santa Barbara Unified School District
Date: May 20, 2020
Subject: Notice of Data Breach

What happened?
In November 2019, Aeries Software discovered unauthorized attempts to access the Aeries Student Information System and began investigating. Aeries is the largest student information system vendor in California and is used by districts across the state. At that time, Aeries did not identify any data compromise. In December 2019, Aeries released security patches as a precautionary measure to address potential vulnerabilities. While investigating the unauthorized access attempt further, Aeries discovered that some data was accessed. On April 27, 2020, Aeries notified districts of the security breach and indicated that only districts using Aeries hosted services were compromised. SBUnified does not use Aeries hosted services and was not impacted. On May 6, 2020, Aeries notified all districts who store their Aeries data on their servers that they might have been impacted and offered assistance in determining whether those districts were compromised. On May 18, 2020, Aeries completed its investigation of SBUnified's database and notified the district that it may have been impacted by the same breach. SBUnified conducted an internal review of Aeries' findings and determined that it was one of hundreds of Aeries districts that were potentially compromised. Aeries received notice that the perpetrators have been taken into custody and that the unauthorized access has been terminated.

What information was involved?
Aeries' investigation determined that student ID numbers, parent and student emails, physical addresses, and hashed passwords may have been subject to unauthorized access. A "hashed password" is encrypted, meaning that the actual password cannot be viewed.

What we are doing?
While there is no evidence to suggest that the data was misused, state law requires that we notify our families whose data may have been subject to unauthorized access. Out of an abundance of caution, we are requiring that all parents/guardians with Aeries accounts reset their Aeries passwords. Students use their District Google accounts to access Aeries, and their Google passwords would not have been at risk as part of this breach. Additionally, we have protections in place to ensure that people outside of our District cannot email our students directly. Aeries fixed the vulnerability that permitted the unauthorized access in December 2019.

What you can do?
Parents/guardians should go to https://aeries.sbunified.org/parent and log in, and the system will walk you through resetting your password. If you have used the same password that you use for Aeries on any other websites, we recommend that you change your password on those other websites. We also recommend that you avoid using the same password on multiple websites in the future.

For more information.
Call our technology helpline at (805) 696-2700 or email us at support@sbunified.org.	The breach appears to have resulted from an unauthorized attempt to access the Aeries Student Information System by hackers. Although Santa Barbara Unified School District did not use Aeries hosted services, Aeries notified the school district that it may have been impacted by the same breach. Student ID numbers, parent and student emails, physical addresses, and hashed passwords may have been subject to unauthorized access.

We are writing to inform you of an issue involving the reservation information you gave us when you arranged your stay at [hotel name]. The issue affected the systems of Sceptre Hospitality Resources (SHR), a service provider we use to manage your reservation. It did not affect our own systems.

SHR recently informed us that, between January 22 and January 29, 2020, an unauthorized party gained access to guest reservation data for a limited number of guests whose information was maintained on SHR's systems. SHR has indicated that the affected reservation information may have included guests' names; contact information; payment card information, including cardholder name, payment card number, expiration date, and security code; and other booking information entered at the time of reservation.

We are taking this matter very seriously. The protection of our guest data is a top priority for us. After learning of the issue, we quickly began working with SHR to address the matter and identify our affected guests. We understand that SHR took steps to secure its systems and stop the unauthorized access to its systems. SHR also has engaged an outside firm to conduct a forensic investigation and contacted law enforcement authorities. The relevant payment card brands also have been notified of the issue.

As indicated above, this issue occurred on SHR's systems and did not impact our systems. We take our obligation to safeguard our guests' information very seriously and are alerting you about this issue so you can take steps to help protect yourself.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear Hosted Customer:

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have affected the Aeries Student Information System.

What Happened?

We want to inform you that your database may have been subject to unauthorized access involving your Parent and Student Data. In late November 2019, Aeries Software became aware of unauthorized attempts to access data through the Aeries SIS. We immediately began an investigation into whether these attempts had been successful and, if so, how they had been accomplished, what impact, if any, they may have had on data, and what steps we could take to thwart future unauthorized access to data through the Aeries SIS using the same or similar means. At the time, internal investigation did not reveal any compromise of the Aeries SIS or data. Nevertheless, Aeries Software deployed a series of security patches in the December 20, 2019 version of the Aeries SIS which addressed the results of our internal investigation.

Then, in late January 2020, we were informed by a locally hosted District that their database may have been previously subject to unauthorized access, they had informed local authorities, and a criminal investigation was underway. We now understand that the investigation by the authorities is ongoing and we are working closely with local law enforcement and federal authorities as well as the District to determine what transpired, by whom it was perpetrated, and what impact, if any, it may have had on data. In working with the District and law enforcement officials, in March 2020 we were able to expand our earlier investigation with the new information as to the methods used by the individuals who had accessed data without authorization. Specifically, we determined that the unauthorized access had included Parent and Student Login information, physical residence addresses, emails, and password hashes. With access to a password hash, weak, common or simple passwords, can be deconstructed to gain unauthorized access to Parent and Student Accounts. According to the results of our investigation, there is evidence to suggest that your database in our Hosted environment may have been subject to unauthorized access by this means. However, we understand the perpetrators have been taken into custody and the unauthorized access has been terminated.

What Information Was Involved?

At the moment, our investigation has revealed Parent and Student Login information, physical addresses, emails, and passwords hashes have been subject to unauthorized access.

What We Are Doing

While there is no evidence to suggest that your data was misused, Aeries Software policy requires that we notify our customers whose data may have been subject to unauthorized access. Out of an abundance of caution, we strongly recommend that you reset the account passwords for your parents and students as soon as possible. To assist our customers with Password security, in the March 26th version of Aeries, a new feature was released to provide System Administrators the ability to run a process that resets the passwords for Parents and/or Students in the PWA table and sends an email that includes a link for that account to reset their password. We strongly recommend ensuring all passwords meet parameters which reflect industry security best practices, such as:

- Force Users to Change Passwords Every 6 months (minimum)
- Days Prior to Expiration to Notify Users - 10 days (minimum)
- Minimum Length: 8-16 Characters
- Require a Special Character
- Require Letters and Numbers
- Require Upper and Lower case

Aeries documentation can be found here: Aeries Password Requirements

It is also important to understand that upon being made aware of these vulnerabilities, we took immediate action to ensure that critical patches were deployed to ensure that the vulnerabilities were no longer a threat to the system. In addition, we have taken additional technical measures to prevent future incidents and we are adopting new security protocols to increase protection of all customer data. In addition to allocating several resources to perform a rigorous internal security audit, we will also be engaging an independent third party to assist us in conducting a complete audit and analysis of our system security.

What You Can Do

While our password guidelines are optional, we strongly recommend ensuring all passwords meet parameters which reflect industry security best practices, such as:

- Force Users to Change Passwords Every 6 months (minimum)
- Days Prior to Expiration to Notify Users - 10 days (minimum)
- Minimum Length: 8-16 Characters
- Require a Special Character
- Require Letters and Numbers
- Require Upper and Lower case

For more information on password settings, the documentation can be found here: Aeries Password Requirements. Documentation for the new Reset Parent/Student accounts can be found here: Reset Parent/Student Account Passwords.

There is nothing to suggest that any data was accessed revealing Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. Nevertheless, If you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the FTCs site at IdentityTheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Consumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations. In addition, you can contact all three major credit bureaus to request that your credit reports be sent to you, free of charge, for your review. Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Thieves may hold stolen information to use at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

For More Information

We will continue to follow-up with any additional recommendations, details, or bulletins that you should be made aware of as more information comes in. For more information, please email legal@aeries.com.	Aeries Software became aware of unauthorized attempts to access data through the Aeries SIS and was later informed that a locally hosted District's database may have also been subject to unauthorized access. The investigation revealed unauthorized access that included Parent and Student Login information, physical residence addresses, emails, and password hashes. There is evidence to suggest that databases in the Hosted environment may have been subject to unauthorized access, although the extent of the breach is uncertain.

Arbonne became aware of unusual activity within a limited number of its internal systems on the evening of April 20, 2020. Arbonne immediately commenced an investigation with the assistance of third-party computer specialists. While the investigation remains ongoing, the preliminary investigation determined that certain information in Arbonne's systems may have been accessed without authorization. On April 23, 2020, the investigation identified a data table containing limited personal information that may have been accessible to an unauthorized actor. Arbonne confirmed that the information that could have been subject to unauthorized access includes personal information such as name, address, username, and password.

Notice to California Residents:

Arbonne provided preliminary notice to affected individuals on April 24, 2020, and began providing supplemental written notice on May 22, 2020. The population of affected individuals includes 3,527 California residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken:

Upon discovering the event, Arbonne moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of Arbonne systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. Specifically, Arbonne forced a password reset for all user accounts whose passwords may have been subject to unauthorized access. As part of Arbonne's ongoing commitment to the security of information, Arbonne is also reviewing and enhancing existing policies and procedures. Arbonne is providing access to credit monitoring and identity protection services for one year through Kroll, to individuals whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident, at no cost to these individuals. Additionally, Arbonne is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. Arbonne is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud. Arbonne has also reported this matter to the FBI and relevant regulators.

Exhibit A:

Arbonne International, LLC (Arbonne) is writing to provide additional details on an incident that may affect the security of some of your personal information. While there is currently no evidence that your information has been misused as a result of this incident, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing you with additional information about the incident, our response, and resources available to you to better protect your information should you feel it appropriate to do so.

[AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL NAME AND ADDRESS]

Dear [name of affected individual]:

We are writing to inform you of an issue involving the reservation information you gave us when you arranged your stay at [hotel name]. The issue affected the systems of Sceptre Hospitality Resources (SHR), a service provider we use to manage your reservation. It did not affect our own systems.

SHR recently informed us that, between January 22 and January 29, 2020, an unauthorized party gained access to guest reservation data for a limited number of guests whose information was maintained on SHR's systems. SHR has indicated that the affected reservation information may have included guests' names; contact information; payment card information, including cardholder name, payment card number, expiration date, and security code; and other booking information entered at the time of reservation.

We are taking this matter very seriously. The protection of our guest data is a top priority for us. After learning of the issue, we quickly began working with SHR to address the matter and identify our affected guests. We understand that SHR took steps to secure its systems and stop the unauthorized access to its systems. SHR also has engaged an outside firm to conduct a forensic investigation and contacted law enforcement authorities. The relevant payment card brands also have been notified of the issue.

As indicated above, this issue occurred on SHR's systems and did not impact our systems. We take our obligation to safeguard our guests' information very seriously and are alerting you about this issue so you can take steps to help protect yourself. You are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports. In addition, we have arranged to offer credit monitoring and identity restoration services to affected guests for one year at no cost to those guests. The enclosed Reference Guide provides information on these services and recommendations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on the protection of personal information.

We regret that this issue at SHR may affect you and hope this information is useful to you. If you have any questions regarding this issue, please contact [relevant toll-free number of call center].

RE: Notice of Security Incident

Dear [NAME],

I am writing on behalf of Weaver Fundraising, LLC d/b/a Trails End (Trails End) to inform you of an incident that involved your personal information. This letter provides you with information about the steps Trails End has taken to guard against future misappropriation or misuse of your personal data.

What Happened?

It appears that an unauthorized party obtained your username from sources other than Trails End (i.e. the dark web or previously compromised accounts), used it to attempt to access your account, and clicked the forgot password button. When we sent a new password to your email address, the unauthorized party was able to pull the new password from network traffic.

With a username and new password, the unauthorized party could enter an account, change information like your username, email address, password, and redeem an Amazon.com Gift Card (gift card). It appears an unauthorized party began pulling passwords from network traffic on May 3, 2020, and we discovered this was occurring on May 7, 2020, and immediately began an investigation to block the attacker.

What Information Was Involved?

Based on our investigation, we believe the unauthorized party gained access to your username and a password needed to access your Trails End account. We believe the unauthorized party also claimed a gift card in your account and changed your email address so that the gift card was not sent to you. We have since provided another gift card for you to claim in your account, and we reset your username and email address back to what it was prior to the attack by the unauthorized party. Our investigation indicates that the unauthorized party did not compromise other information.

What We Are Doing

Once we realized what was occurring, we immediately started an investigation, blocked the attacker, updated our security features, and reset information in your account back to what it originally was prior to the attack. Although we have reset your information, we recommend that you go into your account and change your password since it is currently a random password we assigned to you to prevent the attacker from accessing your account. You also can contact us to update your username if you desire. Although we intend to report this incident to the appropriate law enforcement officials, the mailing of this notice was not delayed by law enforcement.

What You Can Do

Please promptly change your password. Additionally, although we don't believe any of your sensitive information was taken, our required legal notice enclosed called Preventing Identity Theft and Fraud provides more information on ways to protect against the potential misuse of your information.

For More Information

Again, we take the security of your information very seriously, and we will continue to monitor and take measures to protect your information. If you have additional questions, please email us at support@trails-end.com.

Sincerely,

Trails End Popcorn Company
US.127986642.01

Preventing Identity Theft and Fraud

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft. For more information and to contact the FTC, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You may also contact the FTC at: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Credit Reports:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf. Alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies. Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries, including obtaining information about fraud alerts and placing a security freeze on your credit files, is as follows:

Equifax 1-800-349-9960 www.equifax.com P.O. Box 105788 Atlanta, GA 30348

TransUnion 1-888-909-8872 www.transunion.com P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19022

Fraud Alerts:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes:

You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies using the contact information above.

We encourage you to review your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act by visiting https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201504_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf, or by requesting information in writing from the Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Other Important State Information

You may also file a report with your local police or the police in the community where the identity theft took place. Further, you are entitled to request a copy of the police report filed in this matter.

For California Residents:

You can visit the California Office of Privacy Protection (www.oag.ca.gov/privacy) for additional information on protection against identity theft.

For Colorado, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico Residents:

You may obtain one or more (depending on the state) additional copies of your credit report, free of charge. You must contact each of the credit bureaus directly to obtain such additional report(s).

We are writing to inform you about an incident involving your personal information that we maintain. Although we have no evidence that your information was actually used, we take this event very seriously and believe it is important to inform you of what happened, what we have done in response, and what you can do to help protect yourself.

On or about April 6, 2020, we discovered that an unauthorized person had gained access to an employee's email account. We promptly blocked access to the account after discovering the unauthorized access. Our investigation revealed that the unauthorized person obtained access to the email account on or about March 13, 2020, and that the access ceased on or before April 4, 2020. We have engaged a forensics firm to determine whether and to what extent information in the account may have been accessed or acquired.

Our investigation has determined that the compromised email account contained personal information relating to you. We have no evidence that the intruder used or disseminated your information or that obtaining such information was the reason for the intrusion. Furthermore, as of today, our forensic consultant firm confirmed that the information exposed to the intruder could not be located on any of the typical websites known to store or sell misappropriated personal information.

The type of information stored on the compromised email account varied from person to person, but generally included some combination of name, employee ID number, driver's license number, financial account number, date of birth, address, work location, compensation and benefit information, dates of employment, and Social Security number.

To prevent similar occurrences from happening in the future, we are taking security measures to further bolster the security of the information we hold. We have not delayed this notification as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

On April 28, 2020, Car Wash Partners determined that an email security incident may have resulted in unauthorized access to personal information of 1,480 Iowa residents, including names, Social Security numbers and drivers license numbers. Upon learning of the incident, Car Wash Partners immediately took steps to secure the email accounts, launched an investigation, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist.

The investigation determined that an unauthorized individual accessed the email accounts at various times between October 30, 2019 and January 14, 2020. The investigation was not able to determine which emails and attachments, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized person. Therefore, Car Wash Partners conducted a thorough review of the contents of the email accounts and determined that an email or an attachment to an email in the accounts contained the personal information of 1,480 Iowa residents.

Today, Car Wash Partners is sending notification letters via First Class Mail to 1,480 Iowa residents whose personal information was contained in the accessed email accounts. This notice is being provided in accordance with Iowa Code 715C.1-2. Enclosed is a sample copy of the letter.

Car Wash Partners is offering one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection service through Experian to the individuals whose Social Security number or drivers license number were in the accessed accounts. Car Wash Partners is also providing a call center for the individuals to call with questions regarding the incident.

To help prevent this type of incident from happening in the future, Car Wash Partners is implementing enhanced security measures, including multifactor authentication, and providing additional data security training to employees.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

William R. Daugherty
Partner

Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>>,

We are writing to notify you of this incident, to offer you complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services, and to inform you about steps that can be taken to help protect your personal information.

What Happened?

On February 13, 2020, YHB discovered unusual activity in an employee's email account. YHB immediately took steps to secure its email system and launched an investigation with the assistance of a leading digital forensics firm to determine whether additional email accounts may have been impacted and whether any personal information was accessed without authorization. Through this investigation, YHB learned that a limited number of YHB employee email accounts may have been subject to unauthorized access between approximately October 15, 2019, and January 23, 2020. On April 24, 2020, our investigation determined that your information was contained in the impacted accounts and therefore may have been viewed or accessed without authorization. YHB then worked to identify up-to-date address information required to notify you. Please note that this incident was limited to information transmitted via email and did not affect any other information systems. Moreover, we are not aware of the misuse of any of your personal information.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Fraud Alert: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze: You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift, or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources: You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear Valued Member of our Minted Community,

We are writing to notify you of a data security incident involving your personal information. We describe below what happened, what information was involved, and what Minted is doing to address this matter. We also outline what steps you can take in response, including promptly changing your password to your Minted account. We are taking this matter very seriously and sincerely regret any concern it may cause you.

What Happened:

We recently became aware of a report that mentioned Minted as one of ten companies impacted by a potential cybersecurity incident. We promptly undertook an investigation, with the assistance of outside forensic experts. The investigation determined that, on May 6, 2020, unauthorized actors obtained information from our user account database. Since determining this on May 15, we have been continuing to investigate as expeditiously as possible to assess what information was impacted and to identify and notify affected users.

What Information Was Involved:

The information obtained included:

- Your name
- Your login credentials to your Minted account, consisting of your email address and password. Your password was not in plaintext but was in a coded format generated through a cryptographic process known as hashing and salting, which is designed to make your password unreadable.
- If you provided the following information to Minted, your telephone number, billing address, and shipping address(es)

What Information Was Not Involved:

Based on our investigation to date, we have no reason to believe that the following information was affected:

- Your payment or credit card information
- Your address book information
- Your photos or personalized information that you added to Minted designs

What We Are Doing:

We are continuing to investigate this incident diligently, with the ongoing assistance of outside experts. We also promptly notified U.S. federal law enforcement authorities and are closely cooperating with their investigation. In addition, we are reviewing our security protocols and have taken steps to enhance security.

What You Can Do:

Your password was hashed and salted and not stored in plaintext. In an abundance of caution, however, please change your password at your earliest convenience. To change your password:

1. Go to your Minted account page at https://www.minted.com/myaccount
2. Click change password
3. Enter your current and new passwords
4. Click change password.

If you forgot your password, you can reset it here: https://www.minted.com/forgot. You should choose a strong password that is not easy to guess. As an additional precaution, you should change your password for any other online accounts for which you use the same email address and password combination.

As always, please be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask you to provide your personal information electronically and avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails. Minted will never ask you for your financial information via email or phone. It is a good practice to monitor your accounts and any credit reports you receive for any signs of suspicious activity.

Other guidance, including how to obtain a free credit report, is provided in the attached Additional Resources, which we encourage you to review.

For More Information:

Please call our toll-free hotline: 1-844-963-2706 Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. US Central Time, excluding major US holidays. Information is also available on our website: www.minted.com/dataincidentnotice.

R+Co is providing you with information about our investigation and the steps we have taken in response to this incident. R+Co is also offering you information regarding steps you can take to protect your personal information should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On March 16, 2020, R+Co identified suspicious activity on its website (www.randco.com) and immediately initiated an investigation into the incident. As part of the investigation, which was conducted with the assistance of a third-party forensic specialist, it was determined that a malicious script was present on the website from March 6th to March 16th. The malicious script had the ability to access payment card information entered onto the website. Therefore, R+Co is notifying anyone who made a payment card transaction on its website while the script was present.

What Information Was Involved?

R+Co cannot state with certainty that your information was accessed. However, the information that was potentially subject to unauthorized access includes your name, address, and payment card data (account number, card expiration date, and security code.)

What We Are Doing.

You are being notified because your personal information may have been subject to unauthorized access. We take the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. As soon as we discovered the incident, we immediately took steps to address it, including working with computer forensic specialists to determine the full nature and scope of the incident.

As an added precaution, R+Co is also offering you access to 12 months of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services through Experian. The cost of this service will be paid for by R+Co. Instructions on how to enroll in the credit monitoring and identity protection services can be found in the enclosed Information about Identity Theft Protection.

Re: Aeries Parent Portal

Estimado padre/guardián de estudiante de IUSD:

El Distrito Escolar Unificado de Inglewood (el "Distrito") se compromete a proteger la confidencialidad y seguridad de la información de nuestros estudiantes y la de sus padres. Estamos escribiendo para informarles acerca de un incidente reciente que involucró sus datos. Este aviso explica el incidente, las medidas que se han tomado y algunos pasos que puede tomar en respuesta.

¿Qué pasó?

El Distrito utiliza el Sistema de Información de Estudiantes Aeries para proporcionar a los estudiantes y a sus padres acceso en línea a información sobre eventos y horarios escolares. A fines de noviembre del 2019, Aeries se enteró de que una persona no autorizada explotó una vulnerabilidad en el software Aeries que permitiría el acceso a la información de los padres y estudiantes. Tras el descubrimiento, Aeries comenzó una investigación y la policía inició una investigación para identificar a la persona responsable, que Aeries cree que ahora está bajo custodia policial. El 27 de abril del 2020, Aeries notificó al Distrito que esta persona pudo haber accedido al Sistema Aeries del Distrito.

¿Qué información estuvo involucrada?

La información a la que accedió el perpetrador incluía potencialmente el nombre del padre y/o estudiante, la dirección de su casa, el número de teléfono, la dirección de correo electrónico y la contraseña con hash, una forma de hacer que la contraseña real sea indescifrable para terceros, para el Sistema Aeries.

Lo que puede hacer

A pesar de que no tenemos evidencia de que su información personal haya sido mal utilizada, deseamos informarle que esto sucedió y asegurarnos de que lo tomemos muy en serio. Aunque no se accedió a la contraseña en sí, es posible que una persona con suficiente tiempo y habilidad pueda descifrar la contraseña. Por lo tanto, por precaución, se le pedirá que cambie su contraseña la próxima vez que inicie sesión en su cuenta. Además, si usa la misma contraseña para otras cuentas en línea, también recomendamos cambiar la contraseña de esas cuentas.

¿Qué estamos haciendo?

Entendemos la importancia de proteger la privacidad y la seguridad de la información personal, y lamentamos cualquier inconveniente o preocupación que pueda causar este incidente. Para ayudar a evitar que algo como esto vuelva a suceder en el futuro, instalamos el parche de software que Aeries puso a disposición para remediar la vulnerabilidad que permitía a personas no autorizadas acceder a nuestro sistema Aeries. Además, nosotros y Aeries estamos revisando nuestros reglamentos y procedimientos existentes para mitigar cualquier riesgo asociado con este incidente y para prevenir mejor incidentes en el futuro.

Para más información

Nos disculpamos por cualquier inconveniente que esto pueda causarle. Si tienes alguna pregunta, por favor llame (310) 680-5100 o (310) 680-5150 o mande un correo electrónico IUSDtechnicalsupport@inglewoodusd.com.

Sinceramente,

Erika F. Torres, Ed.D., MSW
County Administrator	The sensitive information of students and their parents from the online student information system was accessed by an unauthorized person exploiting a vulnerability in the software. The perpetrator had access to the names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and hashed passwords of the parents and students.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Subject: Notice of Data Breach

Dear [Recipient],

We are writing to inform you about a data breach incident that involved your information. Laguna Beach Unified School District (LBUSD) takes the confidentiality and security of our students' and their parents' information seriously, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause.

What Happened?
LBUSD uses the Aeries Student Information System to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. In late November 2019, Aeries discovered that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. Aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. Upon discovery, Aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who Aeries believes is now in police custody. On May 6th, 2020, Aeries confirmed to us that this individual may have accessed the other districts' Aeries Systems. We then conducted our own investigation and on May 14, 2020, determined that the individual did access parent and student data within the LBUSD's Aeries System.

It is our understanding that over 150 school districts in California have been impacted by this incident.

What Information Was Involved?
The information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, email address, and hashed password, a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties for the Aeries System.

What You Can Do
Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. Even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, you will be required to change your password on May 29th. To further secure your account, we will temporarily disable it if you do not sign in to change your password within 14 days of this notice. You would then need to contact HelpDesk@LBUSD.org to reset your account. Additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well. After the school year closes, we will change the password to all student accounts.

What We Are Doing
We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we are taking steps to prevent unauthorized access to the accounts involved. We are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. To help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that Aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our Aeries system. In addition, we and Aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

For More Information
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions, please email HelpDesk@LBUSD.org.

Sincerely,
Jason Viloria
Superintendent

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

We are writing to make you aware of a recent privacy issue at Catholic Charities of San Diego (Catholic Charities). We take the privacy of our clients very seriously and understand that your personal information is important to you.

What Happened

Catholic Charities was recently the victim of a ransomware attack. The attack was discovered on March 30, 2020. While we do not know for certain, presumably the ransomware was deployed sometime between the close of business on Friday, March 27, 2020, and early morning on Monday, March 30, 2020. Upon discovering the attack, we immediately shut down our entire system and began investigating. We notified the FBI and retained a forensic firm to conduct a thorough investigation. While we initially tried to recover the data from our backups, we were unable to do so. Ultimately, we ended up paying the attacker and recovering all of our data. We do not have any evidence that the attacker or anyone else has misused any of the data subject to the attack. However, we do know that an unauthorized person or persons had access to the data for a short period of time. Therefore, we are notifying you of the incident.

What Information Was Involved

The information involved in the attack included the following:

1) Name
2) Date of birth
3) Address
4) Phone number
5) Social security number
6) Immigration documents
7) Medical information (if provided to us), including medical treatment, diagnoses and medical history
8) Criminal history (if applicable)
9) Copies of pay stubs
10) Case notes
11) Public benefits and cash assistance information

To Enroll, Please Call: 1-833-579-1101
Or Visit: https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect
Enrollment Code: <<XXXXXXXX>>

What We Did and What We Are Doing

As soon as Catholic Charities discovered the ransomware attack, we immediately began investigating and gathering information. The entire system was shut down while we figured out what happened and could confirm that the ransomware was no longer active. Relevant passwords were immediately changed, and the compromised accounts were removed from the system. After paying the ransom, we confirmed that all of our data was recovered and restored. Monitoring and anti-crypto software was deployed. The environment targeted in the attack was retired. We are in the process of moving our backups to a cloud-based system, which will help protect against this type of incident in the future. Finally, we filed a report with the FBI and are working with local law enforcement to provide it with information to assist in its investigation. We will continue to cooperate with any investigations into this matter.

We take our responsibility to safeguard your personal information seriously. We are sorry this happened. In the interest of protecting our clients, we are offering identity theft protection services through ID Experts, a data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with MyIDCare. MyIDCare services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed ID theft recovery services.

(Enclosure)

Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-833-579-1101 to enroll and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop, and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069
Atlanta, GA 30348-5069

TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. Security Freeze	The organization was victim of a ransomware attack that was discovered on March 30, 2020. Despite trying to recover the data from their backups, they couldn't and they ended up paying the attacker and recovering all of their data.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: Important Security Notification. Please read this entire letter.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

I am writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by Good Samaritan Hospital (Good Sam) that may have involved your personal information and/or protected health information, described below. At Good Sam, we take the privacy and security of all information very seriously. While we have no evidence to suggest that any of the impacted information was viewed or misused during this compromise, it is crucial that we be as supportive and transparent as possible. That is why I am writing to inform you of this incident, to offer information about steps that can be taken to help protect your information, and to let you know about complimentary credit monitoring services that we are offering you through Kroll, a global leader in risk mitigation and response. I sincerely apologize for any concern that this incident may cause you. Let me reassure you that Good Sam is dedicated to providing the best care possible, and fully committed to supporting you.

What Happened: On November 4, 2019, Good Sam became aware of a potential compromise to several of its email accounts as a result of a targeted email phishing campaign that occurred over several days. During the course of this phishing campaign, Good Sam employees began receiving fraudulent emails that appeared to be from a known contact. These fraudulent emails contained a link to a malicious website that was designed to steal email account credentials. Upon discovery, Good Sam swiftly blocked access to the malicious website. Additionally, Good Sam immediately took steps to secure the affected accounts, which included resetting the passwords required to access the affected employee email accounts and implementing additional email and network security measures. Further, Good Sam promptly began investigating the incident with the support of a third-party expert forensics firm. Following progress by experts in their thorough investigation, it was ultimately determined that several employee email accounts experienced unauthorized access between October 28, 2019 and November 8, 2019 as a result of the above-referenced phishing campaign. Upon confirmation of the unauthorized access to Good Sam employee email accounts, Good Sam's third-party forensic experts immediately investigated whether the affected email accounts contained individuals' sensitive information. On May 12, 2020, after continued thorough investigation, Good Sam learned that the unauthorized access may have enabled access to your personal information. The information potentially impacted was within the affected employee email accounts in the normal course and scope of business as a part of regular hospital operations. There is no evidence to suggest that any Good Sam employee acted maliciously. Good Sam has worked diligently to obtain sufficient contact information to provide affected individuals with this notification.

While we have no reason to believe that any information within the affected email accounts was actually viewed or misused during this compromise, we are providing this notification to you out of an abundance of caution and so that you may diligently monitor your personal information and resources. We take great care in the security of our technology systems, and regret that this incident has occurred. This incident did not involve Good Sam information systems and is limited to the affected email accounts.

ELN-????-????

Based on the investigation conducted by Good Sam's third-party forensic experts, we believe the goal of the unauthorized individual(s) was to utilize the affected email accounts to redirect employee direct deposit payments rather than obtaining patient information.

What Information Was Involved: It is important to note, as mentioned above, that there is no evidence to suggest that any personally identifiable information or personal health information has been viewed or misused. The personal information that could have been viewed by the unauthorized individual(s) may have included your first and last name, in combination with your date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, tax identification number, financial account number, treatment/diagnosis, health insurance information, billing information, doctor's name, medical record number, medical history, prescription information, Medicare/Medicaid ID and/or patient account number.

What We Are Doing: Good Sam has taken every step necessary to address the incident and is committed to fully protecting all of the information that you have entrusted to us. Unfortunately, phishing events have become more common and the phishing campaign experienced by Good Sam is similar to others experienced by other companies and industries. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately secured the affected accounts and took steps to enhance the security of all information, including patient information,	Good Samaritan Hospital experienced a phishing campaign which resulted in unauthorized access to several employee email accounts between October 28, 2019 and November 8, 2019. The personal information potentially impacted included first and last name, in combination with date of birth, SSN, driver's license number, passport number, tax identification number, financial account number, treatment/diagnosis, health insurance information, billing information, doctor's name, medical record number, medical history, prescription information, Medicare/Medicaid ID and/or patient account number. No evidence was found that any information was actually viewed or misused, but the hospital is offering credit monitoring services through Kroll to affected individuals as a precaution.

NOTICE OF UNAUTHORIZED SYSTEMS ACCESS

Dear Employee_First_Name:

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know about a data security incident that may involve your personal information.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On January 17, 2020, at approximately 10:33 AM, Peterson & Smith Equine Hospital, LLC (Peterson & Smith) it appears that there was an unauthorized access of Peterson & Smith's computer systems. Peterson & Smith's IT team became aware of a potential issue approximately thirty minutes later. Upon discovering the unauthorized access, Peterson & Smith acted quickly to minimize any potential risk by removing the associated technology from the system and commencing a thorough review.

A review of Peterson & Smith's systems, conducted by a forensic investigator hired by Peterson & Smith, revealed that the attack was malware named Ryuk. The forensic investigation revealed that Ryuk was active on the Q drive, where some personal information on Peterson & Smith's employees is kept. There is no confirmation, or even any evidence, that any personal information was accessed. However, because the Ryuk malware is capable of copying information from files, it is possible that personal information of Peterson & Smith's employees was accessed. It appears that this attack was directed at Peterson & Smith itself and not to capture customer information.

March 25, 2020

Page 2

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

Peterson & Smith has been unable to confirm that any personal information of its employees was accessed. However, the files that may have been accessed and copied may have included personal information such as the name, address and social security numbers of employees of Peterson & Smith.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

Peterson & Smith has hired a forensic examiner and conducted a thorough review of the potentially affected computer systems and does not believe that there are any significant risks at this time. However, out of an abundance of caution, Peterson & Smith is taking additional steps to improve our security measures, such as:

- Notifying employees whose information could have been compromised; and
- Forcing password changes in various departments sooner than regularly scheduled.

Peterson & Smith will continue working to ensure the incident is properly addressed and will take any further actions as needed. Peterson & Smith values your privacy and deeply regrets this event occurred.

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

- Place a Fraud Alert on Your Credit Report

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

- Security Freeze

In some states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. A security freeze (also known as a credit freeze) makes it harder for someone to open a new account in your name. It is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to apply for a new credit card, wireless phone, or any service that requires a credit check.	The description of the event states that there was an unauthorized access of Peterson & Smith's computer systems by malware named Ryuk. A forensic investigation revealed that Ryuk was active on the Q drive, where some personal information on Peterson & Smith's employees is kept. Although there was no confirmation or evidence that any personal information was accessed, it is possible that personal information of Peterson & Smith's employees was accessed.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: We are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have resulted in unauthorized access to payment card data used on our website, www.superstrokeusa.com. At Super Stroke USA, we take the privacy and security of your personal information seriously and are continuously evaluating and improving our security and payment systems to ensure your information is secure.

We recently discovered that our e-commerce website was modified with malicious code that captured payment card data as it was entered on the website during a purchase. We immediately engaged external forensic investigators and data privacy professionals to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident. As a result of this review, we determined that the payment card information potentially accessed related to transactions made through our online store between October 10, 2019, and March 27, 2020.

The information that may have been acquired in this incident included customer name, credit or debit card numbers, card expiration dates, and CVVs (3 or 4 digit code on the front or back of the card). We concluded on May 8, 2020, that you completed a transaction at our website during the window of compromise with your card ending in [last four digits of card number], and your card information may be at risk. No other personal information of yours is at risk as a result of this incident.

Because we value our relationship with you, we wanted to make you aware of the incident and what we are doing to further secure your information. We have implemented enhanced security safeguards to help protect against similar intrusions and are conducting ongoing monitoring of our website to ensure that it is secure and cleared of any malicious activity.

Below are precautionary measures you can take to protect your personal information. Additionally, you should always remain vigilant in reviewing your financial account statements for fraudulent or irregular activity on a regular basis. As a best practice, you should also call your bank or card issuer if you see any suspicious transactions. The policies of the payment card brands such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover provide that you are not liable for any unauthorized charges if you report them in a timely manner. You should also ask your bank or card issuer whether a new card should be issued to you.

If you have any further questions regarding this incident, please call our dedicated and confidential toll-free response line at [phone number]. This response line is staffed with professionals familiar with this incident and knowledgeable on what you can do to protect against misuse of your information. The response line is available Monday through Friday, Eastern Time.

Other important information:

1. Placing a Fraud Alert: You may place an initial one-year Fraud Alert on your credit files, at no charge. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you personally before they open any new accounts. To place a fraud alert, call any one of the three major credit bureaus at the numbers listed below. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, they will notify the others.

Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian: 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion LLC: 1-800-680-7289

2. Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File: If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a Security Freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:

Equifax Security Freeze: https://www.freeze.equifax.com or 1-800-349-9960
Experian Security Freeze: http://experian.com/freeze or 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion Security Freeze: http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze or 1-888-909-8872

In order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze. If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account, or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the City in which you currently reside.

3. Obtaining a Free Credit Report: Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

4. Additional Helpful Resources: Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly. If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many creditors will want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint with the FTC by contacting them on the web at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338), or by mail at Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. In addition, you may obtain information from the FTC about fraud alerts and security freezes.	Super Stroke experienced an unauthorized access to payment card data used on their website, between October and March, as a result of a modified e-commerce website with malicious code that captured payment card data. The breach only involved the payment card data, customer name, credit/debit card numbers, card expiration dates and CVVs.

Dear <Affected Individuals Name>,

Notice of Data Breach

FabFitFun values your membership in our community and respects the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to let you know about a recent data security incident that involves your personal information.

What Happened?

Our technical team recently discovered that a third party had illegally placed malicious code on the https://fabfitfun.com/shop/ extension of our website. Our analysis has determined that the code was placed on the Shop portion of the site on May 2nd, and it was discovered shortly thereafter on May 6th as part of a routine review of our site. Shop was not highly trafficked at this time and the code did not impact other, more frequented portions of our website such as Add-Ons and Box purchases. Although only a very limited number of members were impacted, we have since been able to determine that you were likely one such member.

What Information was Involved?

If you completed a purchase on the Shop site between May 2nd and May 6th of this year, we have reason to believe that your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, email address, credit card number, CVV code, and card expiration date were exposed. Although we are not aware of any specific misuse of your information, we strongly urge you to take the steps detailed below. If you were in the process of checking out but did not complete a purchase during this window, we have reason to believe that your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address were exposed. We do not believe your credit card number, CVV code, and card expiration date were exposed, however, we are unable to confirm this with certainty. We are sending you this letter in an abundance of caution and we still urge you to take the steps detailed below.

What We are Doing

We took immediate steps to mitigate this incident by removing the malicious code from our site. We also activated our incident response plan, conducted an internal investigation, and retained advisors to assist in the investigation and response. As with any incident of this nature, we are also of course reviewing our information security policies and practices to determine what, if anything, we can do to further guard against this type of intrusion and to improve site security. We are deeply appreciative that you have chosen to be a part of the FabFitFun community and we are determined to make sure that you are happy with that decision. We are providing you with a complimentary one-year Annual Membership as a token of our appreciation for your business. At the end of your current membership, we will add four pre-paid boxes to your account and give you Select perks during that same time period. Once you have received the four pre-paid boxes, your original subscription will continue unless and until you decide otherwise.

What You Can Do

We urge you to immediately contact your bank that issued your credit card (the relevant phone number should be printed on the back of your card) and follow their recommendations. You should also closely monitor your credit card account statements for suspicious activity. If you see discrepancies or unusual activity, immediately call your bank. Under federal law and card company rules, customers who notify their payment card company in a timely manner upon discovering fraudulent charges will not be responsible for those charges. You may report any fraudulent charges to your local police or sheriffs office in order to file a police report for identity theft and to obtain a copy of the report. You may need to provide copies of the police report to creditors in order to clear any fraudulent charges from your records. You can also take additional actions described on the attachment to this letter.

For More Information

If you have any questions, please contact our customer service team at 855-313-6267 or email privacy@fabfitfun.com for more information. We offer you our sincere apologies that this incident occurred.

Sincerely,

Michael Broukhim, Co-CEO

What Happened

Between April 28, 2019-February 27, 2020, malicious code on TheCrucible.org was skimming data inputted during checkout and saving it on an image file hosted on our site. This code was rendered inactive by updates to TheCrucible.org on February 27, 2020. Upon discovering the malicious code, it was immediately removed and we started a thorough investigation into how the skimmer worked to ensure that no other aspects of TheCrucible.org were compromised. We have reported this security incident to the California Department of Justice.

What We Are Doing

Once we identified this problem, we disabled use of all debit and credit cards on TheCrucible.org until we could resolve the security concern. Only after our investigation and taking steps to make sure this problem couldn't reoccur, did we reactivate the use of credit and debit card transactions on TheCrucible.org. We added an additional third malware scanner to our regular security scans of the site.

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely.

You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear Name,

We are writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the privacy of some of your information. While to date we have no evidence to suggest that information potentially affected by this incident has been misused, we take this incident very seriously and are providing you with details of the incident and the resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On April 28, 2020, Allergy & Asthma Medical Group of the Bay Area discovered that its Berkeley physicians' office was broken into during the evening of April 27, 2020. We immediately initiated an investigation during which we learned that three laptops were stolen. While these laptops were secured, we are taking a conservative approach that the bad actor(s) may have gained access to them. Accordingly, we performed a diligent review to determine what information was present on the laptops and to whom that information related.

Based on that review, we learned that certain limited information relating to your FeNo results was potentially viewable on the laptop.

What Information Was Involved?

Your name, date of birth, Allergy & Asthma Medical Group ID number, physician name, and FeNo test results that included a graph of such results.

Our review confirmed that the bad actor(s) did not have access to your financial information, such as a Social Security Number, credit card number, insurance information, or medical records. The only information that may have been accessible on the laptops is that described above involving your FeNo results.

What Are We Doing?

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. Upon learning of this incident, we took immediate action and changed all laptop and mainframe passwords. While we have strict security measures in place to protect information in our possession, we are currently reviewing those security measures in response to this incident to identify and implement any potential enhancements to our security and privacy policies. We are also conducting additional employee training on our technical, administrative, and physical security and privacy safeguards. Further, we are reporting this incident to law enforcement and appropriate state and federal regulators.

What Can You Do?

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to regularly review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. We are in the process of securing the services of a company to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for twelve (12) months. Please contact Michele Zorovic at 925-935-0856 if you wish to enroll in the credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services. Under U.S. law you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. Finally, you can further educate yourself regarding identity theft, fraud alerts, security freezes, and the steps you can take to protect yourself, by contacting the consumer reporting agencies, the Federal Trade Commission, or your state Attorney General.

For More Information:

We recognize that you may have questions not addressed in this letter. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact me directly at (925) 935-0856.

As mentioned above, to date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, nevertheless we are providing you this notification out of an abundance of caution. We remain committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of our patients' information and sincerely regret and apologize for any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause you.

Sincerely,

Michele Zorovic
Risk Manager	The physical theft of three laptops containing certain limited information relating to patients' FeNO results which included their name, date of birth, Allergy & Asthma Medical Group ID number, physician name, and FeNO test results.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Subject: Aeries Data Security Incident May 12, 2020

Dear Rocklin Unified School District Families,

We are writing to inform you about a data security breach that occurred on Aeries, the District's Student Information System (SIS). Aeries stores and provides access to certain student and parent information for Rocklin Unified School District. We are one of hundreds of districts using Aeries SIS that was affected by this breach. RUSD has been a customer of Aeries for over 20 years, and in that time has had no unauthorized access or data breaches with this software. We do not believe there is any reason to be alarmed or unduly concerned, but we wanted you to be informed about what happened.

Timeline with information provided to us from Aeries:

On April 27, 2020, we were informed that there may have been unauthorized access to the Aeries SIS on November 4th, 2019. The initial report was focused on Aeries Hosted Databases, which we do not use. Our Student Information System is housed on our own servers here in Rocklin. On May 6, 2020, we learned that it may have also affected on-premise databases similar to ours. Following directions provided by Aeries, we immediately contacted Aeries and got confirmation on May 11, 2020, that our data was also accessed.

This breach may have revealed Parent and Student Login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and encrypted passwords. However, no other data elements were impacted as a result of this incident. Social security numbers, credit card data, or other personal information is not kept in our Aeries database. With access to encrypted passwords, unauthorized people may be able to deconstruct weak, common or simple passwords and subsequently enable unauthorized access to parent and student Accounts and data stored in the Aeries SIS.

We have been informed that local and federal law enforcement officials were notified of the incident, charges were filed, and the people responsible were arrested. The investigation of their misconduct is continuing. While there is no evidence to suggest that your specific data was misused, out of an abundance of caution, we will reset the account passwords for all parents and students beginning Tuesday, May 12, 2020. To reset your password, please follow the Forgot Password link on the Aeries Parent/Student Portal.

Further, we will be enforcing stricter password security guidelines as an added precaution against the possibility of future such incidents. All new passwords will employ the following guidelines:

- Force Users to Change Passwords Every 6 months (minimum)
- Days Prior to Expiration to Notify Users - 10 days (minimum)
- Minimum Length: 8-16 Characters
- Require a Special Character
- Require Letters and Numbers
- Require Upper and Lower case

We have no reason to believe that any data was accessed revealing sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. Rocklin Unified School District does not keep this type of information associated with your Aeries account. Nevertheless, if you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the Federal Trade Commission's site at IdentityTheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

For links and more information, go to www.rocklinusd.org/databreach. Here you will also see what actions Aeries is taking to prevent this from happening to our school district and others in the future. If you have any questions, including how to reset your password, please email safedata@rocklinusd.org, and one of our RUSD Technology Services experts will respond and help you in a timely manner.

Thank you,

Rocklin Unified School District	The breach occurred due to unauthorized access to the Aeries student information system, which was hosted on the school district's own servers, by an unknown outside party on November 4th, 2019. Parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and encrypted passwords were potentially accessed. Although law enforcement officials were notified and charges were filed against the perpetrators, it is unknown whether the accessed information was misused.

Dear Parent or Guardian of SBCUSD student:

San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents. We are writing to address a recent incident that involved your data. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

On April 27th, 2020, Aeries Software notified over 150 school districts, including SBCUSD, that their system was breached. The District uses the Aeries Student Information System to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. In late November 2019, Aeries learned that an unauthorized individual exploited a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. Upon discovery, Aeries and law enforcement launched an investigation and believe they have the person responsible in custody.

What Information Was Involved?

The information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties - for the Aeries System.

What You Can Do

While Aeries Software has no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. Although the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, SBCUSD will be implementing a mandatory password policy for all parent and student portal accounts. Additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

What We Are Doing

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. Aeries has installed the necessary software patch to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our Aeries system. In addition, SBCUSD and Aeries Software are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents. To assure that all Aeries Portal users have a strong password, SBCUSD will be implementing a mandatory password change policy. Details and effective date of the mandatory password change policy will be sent to your associated email account.

For More Information

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions, please call (909) 386-2550 or email studentemailsupport@sbcusd.k12.ca.us

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear Parent/Guardian,

The Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School District ("District") is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' and their parents' information. We are writing to address a recent incident involving your data. This notice explains the incident, the measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What happened?

The District uses the Aeries Student/Parent Portal to provide students and their parents with online access to information about school events, student schedules, and grades. In late November 2019, Aeries became aware that an unauthorized person exploited a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to parents' and students' information. Upon discovery, Aeries began an investigation and the police initiated an investigation to identify the responsible person, whom Aeries believes is now in police custody. On May 4, 2020, Aeries notified the District that this person may have accessed the District's Aeries Student/Parent Portal.

What information was involved?

The information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included the parent and/or student's name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password - a way to make the actual password indecipherable to third parties - for the Aeries Student/Parent Portal.

What you can do

Although we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we want to inform you that this happened and assure you that we take it very seriously. Although the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that a person with enough time and skill could decipher the password. Therefore, as a precaution, you will receive an email from aeriesportal@ycjusd.us with information asking you to change your password. Additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we also recommend changing the password for those accounts.

What we are doing

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. To prevent the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. To help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we have installed the software patch that Aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed unauthorized persons to access our Aeries Student/Parent Portal. Additionally, we and Aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you that we recently discovered a security incident that may have involved your personal information. During a review of our data security, we found that malicious code designed to scrape credit card numbers and other personal information may have been present on our e-commerce platform as early as November 11, 2016. We launched an investigation and received an investigative report on May 20, 2020, which confirmed that a new security feature added to our platform on February 16, 2017, prevented the malicious code from functioning after that date. However, there is a window from November 11, 2016, to February 16, 2017, during which customer information may have been exposed.

The malicious code could have enabled the attacker to acquire certain personal information belonging to customers who entered their payment card information in our online checkout process during the relevant period. The affected information may have included your name, address, and payment card data.

We take the security of our customers' information seriously and have taken steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. We have added a feature to our e-commerce platform that prevents malicious code attacks like this one. We are also offering you identity monitoring services at no cost to you for two years, which include Credit Monitoring, Web Watcher, Public Persona, Quick Cash Scan, $1 Million Identity Fraud Loss Reimbursement, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Interstates (Interstates) located at 1400 7th Avenue NE, PO Box 260, Sioux Center, Iowa 51250, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to six hundred eighty-three (683) Iowa residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Interstates does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On or about April 20, 2020, Interstates discovered that personal information of its employees may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party in connection with a data security incident experienced by Paperless Pay. Paperless Pay is a vendor Interstates previously utilized to provide employees with access to their paystubs and W2 forms. With the assistance of third-party forensic specialists, Paperless Pay determined that an unknown third party accessed a Paperless Pay server that stores information of Interstates employees on February 18, 2020. While the investigation by third-party forensic specialists was able to confirm access to the Paperless Pay server, the investigation was unable to rule out access to Interstates employee information on the server.

The information that could have been subject to unauthorized access includes names, addresses, and Social Security numbers.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On or about June 4, 2020, Interstates provided written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes six hundred eighty-three (683) Iowa residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, Interstates moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident and notify potentially affected individuals. Interstates is no longer utilizing the services of Paperless Pay and is seeking assurances that Paperless Pay is destroying any information of Interstates employees from their systems. Interstates is also providing access to credit monitoring services for one year, through Kroll, to individuals whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident, at no cost to these individuals.

Additionally, Interstates is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. Interstates is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, information on protecting against tax fraud, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

What Happened?

On May 12, 2020, the ABC Unified School District was informed by Aeries Software, Inc., the vendor for our student information database, that they had suffered a data breach impacting those who use the ABC USD portal. State and federal law enforcement agencies are conducting ongoing investigations into this data breach. At this point, investigators believe one entity was responsible for the attack, and suspects are in custody. Aeries Software has since patched the software issue that allowed the unauthorized access to occur.

What Information was Involved?

The following information was exposed on November 4, 2019:

- Parent Name
- Student Name
- Student ID (School)
- Physical Resident Address
- Email Address
- Password hashes

Aeries automatically encrypts passwords. A password hash does not reveal the password. However, with access to a password hash, unauthorized persons may be able to deconstruct weak, common, or simple passwords. No other information was exposed. No social security numbers are maintained in the Aeries system; therefore, no risk of compromise to this data is possible. ABC has determined that the unauthorized party attempted to gather your information. No evidence exists that your data was taken, nor misused. ABC is required by law to notify the families that were subject to unauthorized access.

What the District is Doing.

ABCUSD Information & Technology revoked all existing passwords, and users were instructed on how to manually reset their password.

What You Need to Do.

Parents and students need to log in to their Aeries portal as soon as possible and reset their password. It is recommended that families consider changing usernames and/or passwords that may have been in common with those used with the Aeries Portal. For additional support, please contact the Tech Support Hotline at (562) 229-7929.	A software data breach was reported involving Aeries Portal, the online program allowing student and parent access to common educational records. State and federal law enforcement agencies are conducting investigations into this data breach. Investigators believe one entity was responsible for the attack and Aeries Software has since patched the software issue that allowed the unauthorized access to occur.

Dear [Recipient],

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened

Pen Factory values and respects your privacy and is committed to keeping your information confidential. Our commitment to these values includes notifying individuals if we believe the confidentiality of their personal information may have been compromised. Accordingly, we are writing to advise you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

On April 15, 2020, we learned an unauthorized third party placed malicious computer code on our website (https://www.penfactory.com/). Upon learning of the incident, we promptly removed the malicious code and conducted an investigation. The code was active from September 2019 until April 15, 2020, and was designed to collect information typed into the website's checkout page as customers made purchases and deliver that information to the unauthorized third party.

What Information Was Involved

We are notifying you because, as a result of our investigation into this incident, on May 6, 2020, we determined that you made a purchase on our website during the time the malicious code was active. As a result, some of your information, including your name, email, address, and credit or debit card information, may have been obtained by the third party. The incident did not impact your Social Security Number.

What We Are Doing

We have taken steps to alert the credit card brands of the incident so they can monitor your account for potential fraudulent activity. Finally, we have taken additional technical steps to further secure Pen Factory's website and prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future. We also recommend that you check your debit or credit card statements for fraudulent charges.

What You Can Do

As mentioned above, your Social Security number was not impacted so we do not believe your identity is at risk as a result of this incident. Nonetheless, as a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Other Important Information

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes and steps to you can take to avoid identity theft. For more information and to contact the FTC, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You may also contact the FTC at: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Credit Reports: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf. Alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies. Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries, including obtaining information about fraud alerts and placing a security freeze on your credit files, is as follows:

Equifax

Fraud Alerts: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified above to find out more information:

Dear BOUSD Parents,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that affected the Aeries Student Information System (SIS), which stores and provides access to certain student and parent information for Brea Olinda Unified School District. While we do not believe there is any reason to be alarmed or unduly concerned, we wanted to inform you about what happened.

In late April, we were informed that there may have been unauthorized access to the Aeries SIS, which may have revealed Parent and Student Login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and a form of password known as a password hash. However, no other data elements were impacted as a result of this incident. The incident was not isolated to only the Brea Olinda Unified School District, but many districts throughout the state. Aeries also shared with their customers that in addition to an ongoing investigation, arrests have been made, and law enforcement has filed charges against the alleged perpetrators.

While there is no evidence to suggest that your specific data was misused, out of an abundance of caution, we will send you an email with a link to change your Aeries Parent Portal password on Monday, June 8, 2020. Student password information to the Aeries Parent Portal was not impacted as their access is tied to their Google account, and not stored in Aeries.

We consider it important for you to understand that upon being made aware of this incident, Aeries Software took immediate action to ensure the security of the system and has taken additional measures to prevent future incidents, including, but not limited to, engaging an independent third party to assist in conducting a complete audit and analysis of their system security.

If you have any questions, please send an email to AeriesHelp@bousd.us.

Changing Your Aeries Parent Portal Password

On June 8th, 2020, we will send you an Aeries password reset email containing a link to change your Aeries Parent Portal password. A sample of this email is pictured below. Once you have clicked on the link, it will take you to an Aeries website that will ask you to change your password (pictured below).

If you have any questions, please send an email to AeriesHelp@bousd.us.	The unauthorized access to the Aeries Student Information System suggests that an outside party hacked into the system, revealing student and parent login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and password hashes.

Dear Customer,

Castro Valley Health, Inc. takes the privacy and protection of your personal information very seriously. We are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have involved some personal information. Please review the information provided in this letter for steps that you may take to protect yourself against any potential misuse of your information. If after reading this letter you continue to have questions or concerns, you may call the toll-free number at the bottom of this letter during regular business hours.

What Happened:

The incident occurred when certain information about Castro Valley Health, Inc.'s patients inadvertently was transferred during 2016-2017 to a third-party website called Docker Hub. Castro Valley Health, Inc. first became aware of this incident on April 21, 2020, and promptly removed the information from the Docker Hub site. The transferred information was heavily coded and therefore not readable without significant decoding.

What Information Was Involved:

The information that was transferred to the Docker Hub site included: patient names, an entry that said Start of Care-Admission Visits, the name of the nurse, physical therapist, or speech therapist who admitted the patient, the address at which the patient visit was to occur, the patient's date of birth, medical record number, and the start of care date.

What Information Was NOT Involved:

The information did not include Social Security numbers, driver license numbers, Tax ID numbers or bank account information. Importantly, the information also did not include clinical or diagnostic information, notes, plans or orders.

Castro Valley Health, Inc.'s Response:

Castro Valley Health, Inc. began investigating the incident immediately after learning of it. We have no information indicating anyone has used any of the patient information from the Docker Hub website, or that anyone other than the person who alerted the Department of Health and Human Services to the situation ever has viewed the information. We are taking extra steps in addition to our existing policies to safeguard your information, including renewed training and employee orientation, conducting additional internal security audits and risk assessments, and enhancing our policies and procedures.

Additional Steps You May Wish To Take:

Steps you may wish to take include:

1. Get current copies of your medical records from your healthcare providers and medical insurer and review them for any incorrect personal information or unauthorized treatments, procedures or prescriptions;

2. Monitor any medical notices and activity on your accounts; and

3. Place fraud alerts or credit freezes on your accounts to prevent or warn you if anyone without your authority tries to open an account in your name. You can check your credit reports at annualcreditreport.com from any one of the three major credit bureaus Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion and place a fraud alert on your credit report. Their contact information is below:

Equifax: 1-888-548-7878

TransUnion: 1-800-916-8800

Experian: 1-888-397-3742

If you have reason to believe that your Medicare or Medicaid information is being improperly used, report that online or call 800-HHS-TIPS.

For More Information:

We sincerely apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience it may cause you. Should you have questions or concerns regarding this matter, please call 1-888-688-2497 toll-free during regular business hours.

Sincerely,

Castro Valley Health, Inc.	The incident occurred due to the inadvertent transfer of certain patient information to Docker Hub, a third-party website. The transferred information was coded and not readable without significant decoding.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear Parents,

We are writing to inform you of a recent incident involving your data at Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District (the District). Our commitment to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents is unwavering. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

The District uses the Aeries Student Information System to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. In late November 2019, Aeries discovered that an unauthorized individual exploited a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. Upon discovery, Aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who Aeries believes is now in police custody. On May 6, 2020, Aeries notified us that this individual may have accessed the District's Aeries System.

What Information Was Involved?

The information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, and login information for the Aeries System, consisting of email address and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties.

What You Can Do

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. Even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, we will be implementing a mandatory password reset for all parent and student portal accounts. Additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

What We Are Doing

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. To help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that Aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our Aeries system. In addition, we are working with Aeries to review our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

For More Information

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions, please call the Superintendent's Office at (707)399-5009 or email LindaMa@fsusd.org.

Sincerely,

Chris Clark
Director of Technology Support Services

The privacy and security of personal information is of the utmost importance to us, and we want to provide you with information about the incident, the services we are making available to you, and the measures we are taking to protect your personal information.

On or about November 4, 2019, an unknown third party gained unauthorized access to a single email account at Ottawa Kent.

Throughout our investigation, we worked with outside cybersecurity professionals who regularly investigate and analyze these types of incidents.

After a thorough review of the contents of the email account, we determined on May 4, 2020, that the account contained your full name and Social Security number. To date, we are not aware of any reports of identity fraud or improper use of your information as a direct result of this incident. However, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to make you aware of the incident and explain the services we are making available to help safeguard you against identity fraud.

We are writing to inform you about an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

WHAT HAPPENED:

On April 6, 2020, TAIT became aware of a data security incident in which an unauthorized party accessed a TAIT computer server and the email accounts of certain TAIT personnel. Upon learning of the incident, TAIT immediately took its servers and IT systems offline and a leading cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with the investigation. Although the investigation is ongoing, the investigation has revealed that the unauthorized access began on February 16, 2020.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED:

TAIT's investigation into this matter is ongoing, but TAIT has determined that the server content and email accounts accessed by the unauthorized party may have contained some individuals' names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, or financial account numbers.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:

To date, TAIT has no reason to believe that any of the information maintained in the server and email accounts was misused. Out of an abundance of caution, we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your financial account statements for any unauthorized activity. If you see charges or activity you did not authorize, we suggest that you contact your financial institution immediately. As a precaution, we are prepared to offer credit monitoring at no charge to those individuals potentially affected by this incident. For more information or to sign up for credit monitoring, please call our dedicated call center for this issue at 855-917-3540.

Fraud Alerts:

There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft.

Dear Parent/Guardian,

We are writing to inform you that your Aeries Parent Portal account password has been reset due to a potential security threat. Yuba City Unified School District (the District) takes the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents seriously. We are addressing a recent incident that may have involved your data. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

The District uses the Aeries Student Information System to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. In late November 2019, Aeries learned that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. Aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. Upon discovery, Aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who Aeries believes is now in police custody. On May 6, 2020, we learned that this individual may have accessed the Districts Aeries System. Based on our own investigation of the information available, we cannot rule out the possibility that parent and student data in the Districts Aeries System was accessed.

What Information Was Involved?

The information accessible to the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties for the Aeries System.

What You Can Do

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. Even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, your password has been reset. You will find a temporary password in this email that you can use to log in to your account and create a new password. Your new password must include the following:

- Lower case letters
- At least one (1) upper case letter
- At least 1 special character
- At least 1 number
- Contain at least eight (8) characters

You will also be required to change your password at least every six months. Additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

What We Are Doing

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. In order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we have reset all passwords for the Districts Aeries System and are requiring all account holders to create a new password the next time they log in to their accounts were involved to change their passwords. To help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that Aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to potentially access our Aeries system. In addition, we and Aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

For More Information

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions, please call our IT help desk at 530-790-2569.

Sincerely,

YCUSD IT Department

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

We are contacting you about a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. Corning Union High School District takes the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. For this reason, we are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident.

What Happened?
The district's Student Information System developer, Aeries Software, Inc. (DBA Eagle Software), was notified in late November 2019 of unauthorized attempts to access data through the Aeries SIS. In response, they immediately began an investigation into whether these attempts had been successful and, if so, how they had been accomplished, what impact on data, if any, and what steps they could take to thwart future unauthorized access to data through the Aeries SIS using the same or similar means. At the time, their investigation did not reveal any compromise of the Aeries SIS or data. Nevertheless, Aeries Software deployed a series of security patches in the December 20, 2019 version of the Aeries SIS which addressed the findings of their internal investigation.

In working with the District and law enforcement officials, in March 2020 Aeries Software was able to expand their earlier investigation with the new information as to the methods used by the individuals who had accessed data without authorization. Specifically, they determined that the unauthorized access had included Parent and Student Login information, physical residence addresses, emails addresses, and password hashes. With access to a password hash, weak, common or simple passwords can be deconstructed to gain unauthorized access to Parent and Student Accounts.

What Information Was Involved?
Parent and Student Login information, physical residence addresses, emails addresses, and password hashes. However, no other data elements were impacted as a result of this incident.

What We Are Doing
While there is no evidence to suggest that your data was misused, state law requires that we notify our families whose data may have been subject to unauthorized access. Out of an abundance of caution, we have reset the portal account passwords. It is also important to understand that upon being made aware of these vulnerabilities, Aeries Software took immediate action to ensure that critical patches were deployed to ensure that the vulnerabilities were no longer a threat to the system. In addition, Aeries Software has taken additional technical measures to prevent future incidents, and they are adopting new security protocols to increase protection of all student data. Aeries Software will also be engaging an independent third party to assist them in conducting a complete audit and analysis of their system security.

What You Can Do
We have no reason to believe that any data was accessed revealing sensitive information that would directly impact your credit rating. If you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the FTC's site at IdentityTheft.gov. You can also contact all three major credit bureaus to request that your credit reports be sent to you, free of charge, for your review.

For More Information
We will continue to follow-up with any additional recommendations, details, or bulletins that you should be made aware of as more information comes in. If you have any questions regarding this incident or if you desire further information or assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us at 530-824-8000.

Sincerely,
Corning Union High School District	The data breach notification stated that there were unauthorized attempts to access data through the Aeries SIS by an outside party. The investigation revealed that the unauthorized access included Parent and Student Login information, physical residence addresses, emails addresses, and password hashes.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

I wanted to let you know about a potential data security incident experienced by Gonzalez CPA that may have impacted your personal information. I value and respect the privacy of your information, and sincerely apologize for any concern or inconvenience this may cause you. This letter contains information about steps you can take to protect your information, and resources I am making available to help you.

What happened?

Beginning in March 2020, I learned that a limited number of my clients had experienced fraudulent tax filings. Upon learning of this fraud, I hired an independent computer forensic investigator to determine if there was a compromise of my network. To date, the forensic investigators have found no suspicious activity on my systems. We have asked our tax software provider to launch their own investigation as well. Our forensic investigation is ongoing, and I don't yet know whether any of your information was compromised, but I wanted to let you know before the investigation is complete so you can take steps to protect yourself.

What Information was involved?

Information that may be affected includes your tax return information, such as your name, address, Social Security number, bank account number if you provided that to me, and other tax-related information.

What we are doing:

While the investigation is ongoing, I have arranged for you to receive credit monitoring and identity protection services at no cost to you provided by MyIDCareTM powered by ID Experts for 12 months.

How to Enroll:

You can sign up online or via telephone. You will find detailed instructions for enrollment on the enclosed Recommended Steps document. Also, you will need to reference the enrollment code at the top of this letter when calling or enrolling online, so please do not discard this letter.

If you received a fraudulent deposit from the IRS into your bank account, the IRS has recommended the following:

1. Do not spend this money, as it must be returned to the IRS.
2. Contact your bank's fraud department and let them know that the money was deposited as a result of a fraudulent tax filing, and that the deposit should be reversed as soon as possible.
3. Do not return the money by check. The most reliable way for the money to be returned and credited to you is to instruct your bank to reverse the deposit.
4. If you have any issues with your bank and the return of the money, please contact me.

Additionally, if you know or suspect you are a victim of tax-related identity theft, the IRS recommends the following steps:

Respond immediately to any IRS written notice. The IRS will not contact you via phone.

If you received a Letter 4883C from the IRS indicating that they received a suspicious tax return with your name on it, you should follow the instructions on that letter to verify your identity with the IRS. Once you verify your identity, you can advise the IRS that you did not file the suspicious tax return. Additionally, you may be asked to file a paper return for the current filing season.

If you believe you may be a victim of tax fraud but have not received a Letter 4883C from the IRS, you should fill out and submit IRS Form 14039, which is available at IRS.gov. I can provide you with a copy of that form and assist you with filling it out if you would like. If you plan on filing on extension, please contact me for more information.

If you previously contacted the IRS and did not have a resolution, contact the IRS for specialized assistance at 1-800-908-4490. The IRS has teams available to assist. You should also visit https://www.irs.gov/individuals/how-irs-id-theft-victim-assistance-works for more information.

The security of your information is of the utmost importance to me. Once the forensic investigation is completed, I will be working closely with the investigators to identify additional security measures to further enhance the security of my system.

Other important information:

If you have any questions or concerns, please call 1-800-939-4170 Monday through Friday, 8 am - 8 pm Central Time. Your trust is a top priority for me, and I deeply regret any inconvenience or concern that this matter may cause you.

Sincerely,

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: We represent Zoosk, Inc. (Zoosk) located at 3300 N. Ashton Blvd, Suite 240 Lehi, UT 84043, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to California residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Zoosk does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of California law, the applicability of the California data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event
On May 11, 2020, Zoosk was alerted to a potential compromise of certain Zoosk user information. Zoosk immediately launched an investigation with the assistance of outside cybersecurity and forensic specialists and contacted law enforcement authorities. Zoosk is committed to providing its full cooperation with their investigative and prosecutorial activities. While the investigation remains ongoing, Zoosk determined that an unauthorized third party gained access to Zoosk data stored in a database hosted by a third party on or around January 12, 2020. The database contained certain information a user may have included in his/her online Zoosk profile. The majority of this profile information was maintained in the database in an unreadable format, however, a name, email address (username), date of birth, generalized demographical information, gender, and gender search preference may have been readable in the database. While not confirmed, passwords may also have been affected. The database did not contain financial or credit card data. Zoosk does not collect Social Security numbers, drivers licenses, passport numbers, or other taxation or government identity information, so none of these types of information are at issue. Pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code 1798.82 (West) the personal information that could have been subject to unauthorized acquisition includes name and email address (Zoosk username). While unconfirmed at this time, a user's password for his/her Zoosk online account may have been subject to unauthorized access.

Notice to California Residents
On June 3, 2020, Zoosk began providing direct notice of this incident to all affected individuals by email, which includes 560,138 California residents. Please note, this number is a best estimate of impacted individuals for California. Zoosk maintains email address information for its members and not physical address information. Email notification is being provided in substantially the same form as the email draft attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken
Upon discovering the event, Zoosk moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of Zoosk systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. Zoosk implemented various remediation efforts such as changing and rotating passwords, changing access keys, enabling multifactor authentication, monitoring of user activity and access, and is assessing the implementation of additional safeguards and training to its employees. In an abundance of caution, Zoosk is advising its members to change their password for their Zoosk account and is providing additional information on password security practices. Zoosk is also providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect personal information, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to law enforcement and information regarding security freezes and fraud alerts. Zoosk is providing the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies and a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Zoosk established a dedicated call center to offer support to its members and to respond to member questions and concerns related to the event. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission was also provided.

EXHIBIT A
The email draft attached as Exhibit A is a notice of the data security event sent to Zoosk members. It includes information about the incident, steps taken by Zoosk, and guidance for members on how to protect their personal information. It also provides contact information for Zoosk's member support phone numbers and regulatory authorities.	Zoosk's user data was compromised by an unauthorized third party gaining access to Zoosk data stored in a database hosted by a third-party on or around January 12, 2020. The majority of profile information was maintained in an unreadable format, however, a name, email address (username), date of birth, generalized demographic information, gender, and gender search preference may have been readable in the database. While not confirmed, passwords may also have been affected.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear FullName,

We recently informed you of an incident affecting MaxLinear and are sending this letter to provide you with an update regarding your personal information. Please read this letter carefully and contact us with any questions.

WHAT HAPPENED

On May 24, 2020, we discovered a security incident affecting some of our systems. We immediately took all systems offline, retained third-party cybersecurity experts to aid in our investigation, contacted law enforcement, and worked to safely restore systems in a manner that protected the security of information on our systems.

Our investigation to-date has identified evidence of unauthorized access to our systems from approximately April 15, 2020 until May 24, 2020. Our investigation has also identified evidence of unauthorized access to files containing personal information relating to you.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED

The information contained in these documents may include your name, personal and company email address and personal mailing address, employee ID number, drivers license number, financial account number, Social Security number, date of birth, work location, compensation and benefit information, dependent, and date of employment.

In addition to the complimentary monitoring services we are offering, to protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file.

The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any of the toll-free numbers of the credit reporting agencies provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three credit bureaus.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

To place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file, contact each credit reporting agency directly:

When you place any type of fraud alert on your credit file, the credit reporting agencies will send you a free copy of your credit report. Look for accounts that are not yours, debts you do not owe, or any other inaccuracies (e.g., wrong social security number or home address). If you find an error, contact the credit reporting agency directly. By law, that credit reporting agency must investigate and respond.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Re: Notice of Data Breach

We recently informed you of an incident affecting DMI and are sending this letter to provide you with an update regarding your personal information. Please read this letter carefully and contact us with any questions.

WHAT HAPPENED

We recently discovered a security incident affecting some of our systems. We immediately took all systems offline, retained third-party cybersecurity experts to aid in our investigation, contacted law enforcement, and worked to safely restore systems in a manner that protected the security of information on our systems.

Our investigation identified evidence of unauthorized access to our corporate systems supporting US and Canadian operations. We do not know if sensitive personal information held on our affected systems was accessed, which is why out of an abundance of caution we are informing you of this matter.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED

The information contained in the compromised systems may include:

WHAT WE ARE DOING

As a precautionary measure, we are offering you free credit monitoring services through Experian's IdentityWorksSM for a period of one year. This product provides you with daily monitoring of your credit report from Experian, internet surveillance, and identity restoration assistance. To activate your membership and start enrollment in the complimentary monitoring service, please follow the steps below:

Ensure that you enroll by: 9/30/2020 (Your code will not work after this date.)
Visit the Experian IdentityWorks website to enroll: https://www.experianidworks.com/credit
Provide your activation code:

WHAT YOU CAN DO

In addition to signing up for the complimentary monitoring service, to protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any of the toll-free numbers of the credit reporting agencies provided below. You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three credit bureaus.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

To place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file, contact each credit reporting agency directly:

Equifax PO Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374-0241 1-800-685-1111 www.equifax.com
Experian PO Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com
TransUnion PO Box 1000 Chester, PA 19016 1-800-680-7289 www.transunion.com

When you place any type of fraud alert on your credit file, the credit reporting agencies will send you a free copy of your credit report. Look for accounts that are not yours, debts you do not owe, or any other inaccuracies (e.g., wrong social security number or home address). If you find an error, contact the credit reporting agency directly. By law, that credit reporting agency must investigate and respond.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also recommends regularly reviewing statements from your accounts and periodically obtaining your credit report from one or more national credit reporting agencies.

If you have questions about the product, need assistance with identity restoration, or would like an alternative to enrolling in Experian IdentityWorks online, please contact Experian's customer care team at 866-578-5413 by 9/30/2020. Please be prepared to provide engagement number ENGAGE# as proof of eligibility for the identity restoration services by Experian.

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228. (Hearing-impaired consumers can access their TDD service at 1-877-730-4204.) The FTC provides an identity theft hotline: 1-877-438-4338; TTY: 1-866-653-4261. The FTC also provides information online at www.ftc.gov/idtheft. For Mail: Identity Theft Clearinghouse, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

For any accounts you maintain, security experts recommend implementing multi-factor authentication, where offered. If you are a participant in the DMI 401(k) plan administered by Fidelity, for example, you can implement multi-factor authentication through the Fidelity account settings. If you have any questions about your DMI 401(k) account, please contact Fidelity at 1-800-835-5097 or log into your account to make changes at www.401k.com.

RE: Notice of Data Breach

Dear Families,

We are writing to inform you about an incident potentially affecting some of your students' personal information. We value all our students and families and are providing this notice to outline some steps you may take to help protect yourself.

WHAT HAPPENED

On June 2, 2020, KIPP SoCal was notified of an issue involving unauthorized access to a data file containing certain students' information. The issue was found when a vendor that we contract with discovered that our GitHub page containing the data file had an incorrect privacy setting, allowing our data file to be searchable within the confines of GitHub from October 3, 2019, through June 2, 2020. The page may have been accessed seven times by individuals or robots during the time it was exposed. You are receiving this notice because we determined that your students' information was among those that were accessed without authorization.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED

The student information was stored on a data platform called GitHub that KIPP SoCal and many other public organizations use for data management. The page containing the data file included student names, addresses, birth dates, race/ethnicity, primary language, and primary disability. Social security numbers were not included in the file. The issue has been resolved, and we do not have any evidence that the information has been misused.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

After KIPP SoCal learned of the issue, we immediately deleted the data file and inactivated the GitHub page, conducted a full audit of GitHub and other data platforms, and put additional layers of security into place for future protection. We take the safety and security of our students' information very seriously and reinforce our pledge to make our schools safe zones. We are in the process of conducting data security audits across all of our systems to ensure that this is an isolated incident and it does not happen again.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

We recommend you be on the alert for any suspicious activity related to your financial accounts and credit reports. Despite no social security numbers or drivers' license or identification card numbers being part of this file, we encourage you to regularly monitor your statements and records to ensure there are no transactions or other activities that you did not initiate or authorize. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You can review your credit information by contacting the three credit bureaus and have the option of placing a fraud alert on your accounts. The three credit bureaus' contact information is listed below:

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Magellan Health Inc. provides healthcare delivery, employee assistance program services, and pharmacy management services to health plans, managed care organizations, employers, labor unions, military and governmental agencies, and third-party administrators. They also manage health services for individuals enrolled in their Medicaid and Medicare programs. Magellan may have obtained personal information through the services they provide to your employer or health plan, or to you directly.

On April 11, 2020, Magellan discovered that they were targeted by a ransomware attack. The unauthorized actor gained access to Magellan's systems by sending a phishing email on April 6 that impersonated a Magellan client. Magellan immediately retained a cybersecurity forensics firm, Mandiant, to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident. The investigation revealed that this incident may have affected personal information. At this point, there is no evidence of fraud or misuse of any personal information as a result of this incident, but Magellan is notifying individuals out of an abundance of caution.

The personal information accessed by the unauthorized actor included Social Security numbers and/or other financial information, names, dates of birth, treatment information, health insurance account information, member ID, other health-related information, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses. Magellan immediately reported the incident to the appropriate law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, and implemented additional security protocols to protect their network, email environment, systems, and personal information.

Magellan is offering a complimentary two-year membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM to help protect identities. They also provided an Information About Identity Theft Protection reference guide, which includes steps individuals can take to help protect themselves, including recommendations from the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and details regarding placing a fraud alert or a security freeze on credit files.

If individuals have any questions or need additional information, they can contact Magellan at 888-451-6558.	The breach was caused by a ransomware attack via a phishing email that impersonated a Magellan client.

You Can Trade, Inc. ("YCT"), a subsidiary of TradeStation Group, Inc., is an online education service company (hereinafter collectively referred to as "TradeStation"), that values and respects your privacy, which is why we are writing to make you aware of a recent incident that involves some of your personal data.

WHAT HAPPENED

On May 28, 2020, YCT discovered that certain personal data of YCT customers and prospective customers (YCT Data) was accessed by one or more unauthorized persons.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED

The data accessed may have included personal data such as: first name, last name, username, password (salted and hashed), email address, and phone number. If you purchased a subscription with You Can Trade, Inc., additional personal data involved includes your billing address, credit card type, but only the last four digits of your credit card number and credit card expiration date. Given the types of personal data that may be affected (particularly given that passwords are salted and hashed which means that they are not visible and the fact that limited credit card data was accessed), we believe it is unlikely that there will be harmful consequences from this incident.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

TradeStation has an enterprise-wide Information Security department whose responsibilities include all TradeStation subsidiaries, including YCT. TradeStation has implemented preventive measures to safeguard your personal data that includes a variety of technical and administrative measures designed to protect electronic systems and the information on those systems from unauthorized access, use, and other malicious acts. However, in the event of an incident, TradeStation has a comprehensive incident response plan that facilitates the detection, review, and containment of an incident. TradeStation has implemented additional security measures to prevent a reoccurrence. Additionally, TradeStation identified two domains (shayand.com and youcantrade.urtestsite.com) that accessed the YCT DATA and were mimicking the appearance of YCT's website. We promptly acted and shut down both domains.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant and do not click on any emails that you may receive that may seem suspicious and/or may contain any links or language with the above-referenced domains (shayand.com or youcantrade.urtestsite.com). If you do have an account with YCT, please make any changes to your account by logging directly onto the YCT website (www.youcantrade.com).

For further information and assistance, please contact us at support@youcantrade.com.

Sincerely,

We want to provide you with information about the incident, explain the services we are making available to you, and assure you that we are taking significant measures to protect your information.

What Happened?

We received notice from our tax software company that some of our clients' 2019 federal tax returns had been fraudulently filed. If you are one of those clients, we have already contacted you (or the primary filer) directly by phone.

What We Are Doing

Upon learning of the issue, we immediately secured our tax software and commenced a prompt and thorough investigation.

We also immediately notified the Internal Revenue Service of the issue and continue to work with them.

What Information Was Involved?

On May 5, 2020, the forensic investigation concluded that an unauthorized third party accessed our system in April 2020 and may have acquired certain individual client information, including your full name and Social Security number. To the extent you provided your bank account information (routing and checking account numbers) to us, that information may have been accessed as well. The compromised information included the personal information of primary individual filers, spouses, and dependents. Each person on the tax return will be notified separately of this incident.

What You Can Do

To protect you from potential misuse of your information, we are offering a one-year membership in Experian IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft.

This letter also provides other precautionary measures you can take to protect your personal information, including placing a fraud alert and/or security freeze on your credit files and/or obtaining a free credit report. Additionally, you should always remain vigilant in reviewing your account statements for fraudulent or irregular activity on a regular basis.

If your tax return was fraudulently filed, we have been working with you to file a paper return along with a Form 14039 (Identity Theft Affidavit) with the IRS. If you have not received a phone call from us notifying you that a fraudulent return was filed with your information, then your return was not affected and will be e-filed by our firm when it is complete. To the extent that you provided your bank account information to us, you may contact your financial institution to inquire about steps to take to protect your account, including whether you should close your account or obtain a new account number.

For More Information

We apologize that this incident occurred. We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our clients' information and have taken many precautions to help safeguard it. We continually evaluate and modify our practices to enhance the security and privacy of our clients' information and have taken steps to prevent further unauthorized access to client records.

You must contact each of the credit reporting agencies directly to obtain such additional report(s).

Security Freeze: Security freezes, also known as credit freezes, restrict access to your credit file, making it harder for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. You can freeze and unfreeze your credit file for free. You also can get a free freeze for your children who are under 16. And if you are someone's guardian, conservator, or have a valid power of attorney, you can get a free freeze for that person, too. How will these freezes work? Contact all three of the nationwide credit reporting agencies Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. If you request a freeze online or by phone, the agency must place the freeze within one business day. If you request a lift of the freeze, the agency must lift it within one hour. If you make your request by mail, the agency must place or lift the freeze within three business days after it gets your request. You also can lift the freeze temporarily without a fee. Don't confuse freezes with locks. They work in a similar way, but locks may have monthly fees. If you want a free freeze guaranteed by federal law, then opt for a freeze, not a lock. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue.

For New Mexico residents: You may obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You may submit a declaration of removal to remove information placed in your credit report as a result of being a victim of identity theft. You have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report or submit a declaration of removal pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting and Identity Security Act.

For Colorado and Illinois residents: You may obtain information from the credit reporting agencies and the FTC about security freezes.

Fraud Alerts: A fraud alert tells businesses that check your credit that they should check with you before opening a new account. As of September 18, 2018, when you place a fraud alert, it will last one year, instead of 90 days. Fraud alerts will still be free and identity theft victims can still get an extended fraud alert for seven years.

For Colorado and Illinois residents: You may obtain additional information from the credit reporting agencies and the FTC about fraud alerts.

Federal Trade Commission and State Attorneys General Offices: If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your home state.

I am writing to provide notification of an incident at Orascom Construction USA, Inc. and its operating entities The Weitz Company, LLC; Contrack-Watts, Inc.; and Watts Constructors, LLC (hereinafter Orascom) that may affect the security of personal information of seven hundred fifty-six (756) Iowa residents.

Orascom is providing the affected residents with written notification of this incident commencing on or about June 8, 2020, in substantially the same form.

Orascom is offering all the Iowa residents whose SSNs were impacted a one-year membership in credit monitoring services at its own expense in order to protect them against identity theft. Orascom is also advising the affected residents about the process for placing fraud alerts and/or security freezes on their credit files and obtaining free credit reports. The affected residents are also being provided with the contact information for the consumer reporting agencies, the Iowa attorney general's office, and the Federal Trade Commission.

At Orascom, protecting the privacy of personal information is a top priority. Since learning of the incident, Orascom has implemented enhanced security safeguards to help protect against similar intrusions. Orascom is also conducting ongoing monitoring of its network to ensure that it is secure and cleared of any malicious activity.

Dear Sonicbids User,

We are writing to inform you of an incident that may impact the security of your Sonicbids username and password. We are providing you with information about the event and a reminder to use strong passwords to protect your online accounts.

What Happened?

On May 17, 2020, we learned that certain Sonicbids usernames and passwords were publicly accessible as a result of a data privacy event involving our third-party cloud hosting services, which we use to store information related to Sonicbids users. We immediately launched an investigation and determined that an unauthorized actor had accessed Sonicbids cloud instance and obtained usernames and passwords for certain individuals. The actor then made this information publicly accessible for a limited period of time. Out of an abundance of caution, we immediately reset all Sonicbids user passwords, including yours. We also conducted a thorough review of the information that was publicly available to confirm the identities of individuals whose credentials were publicly accessible and provide them with notice as soon as reasonably possible. As part of our investigation of this incident, we determined that the unauthorized access to our cloud instance occurred on December 29, 2019.

What Information was Involved?

Our investigation determined that the incident impacted your name and Sonicbids username and password.

What We Are Doing.

Protecting the privacy and security of our users' personal information is among our highest priorities. We immediately took steps to respond to this incident and continue to implement enhanced security protocols to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. Our immediate steps included taking the Sonicbids site offline, forcing password resets for all users, and ensuring appropriate permissions were restored prior to relaunching the site. We also worked with outside computer specialists to identify and remediate any potential vulnerabilities within our network. We retrained our staff on data security and are notifying regulatory authorities as required by law. We've also been in contact with federal law enforcement and are cooperating as required.

What You Can Do.

Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Notice of Data Breach

To Parent or Legal Guardian of [PATIENT NAME]:

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have affected your child's information. CodeMetro provides software solutions to applied behavior analysis providers, including [CUSTOMER NAME], from which your child may have received services.

What happened?

On April 21, 2020, CodeMetro systems suffered a ransomware attack, which was detected within hours of its deployment. Upon discovery, we took immediate steps to contain the threat and engaged a third-party forensic firm to investigate the incident and assist with remediation efforts. We also notified federal law enforcement authorities of the incident.

Our investigation has found that prior to deploying the ransomware, the criminals were able to access a database server and deploy tools to copy and remove some data. The database server contained health-related patient information.

What information may have been involved?

As a result of the investigation, we were able to determine that your personal information may have been potentially involved, and we notified your child's provider of the incident on or about May 29, 2020. The patient information that was involved may have included:

1. Information to identify and contact the patient (such as patient name, patient picture, parent/legal guardian name, guarantor name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, gender, and ethnicity);
2. School information (school name, Individualized Education Program (IEP) start and review dates, assessment and psychological evaluation dates, and eligibility type (type of behavioral or developmental condition or impairment));
3. Health insurance information (payer name, payer contract dates, policy information including type and deductible amount, and policy ID number); and
4. Medical information (dates of enrollment with your ABA provider's services, authorized services, allotted time/number of sessions, diagnostic codes and modifiers, charge/reimbursement rates, outcomes, and provider names).

[If your child is covered under TRICARE, the health insurance ID number may be a guarantor/legal guardian's Social Security number.]

What we are doing.

As soon as we discovered the incident, we promptly launched a forensic investigation, contacted law enforcement, and took steps to remediate the incident. We take data security incidents very seriously and have worked to implement the necessary steps to ensure the continued protection of your data. In response to this incident, we have enhanced our security and monitoring as well as hardened our systems to minimize the risk of any similar incident in the future.

We have arranged to offer you credit monitoring for a period of one year, at no cost to you, through Epiq. You have until [DATE] to activate these services, and instructions on how to activate these services are included in the attached Reference Guide.

To order your free annual credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at (877) 322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) website at www.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The three credit bureaus provide free annual credit reports only through the website, toll-free number, or request form. Upon receiving your credit report, review it carefully. Look for accounts you did not open. Look in the inquiries section for names of creditors from whom you have not requested credit. Some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names; the credit bureau will be able to tell if this is the case. Look in the personal information section for any inaccuracies in information (such as home address and Social Security Number). If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone number on the report. Errors may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. You should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. If there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in writing. Information that cannot be explained should also be reported to your local police or sheriff's office because it may signal criminal activity.

RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear [Insert Name],

I am writing to inform you of a data breach incident that occurred with our third-party e-commerce system, which may have compromised your contact information and/or payment card information. The ASA takes matters such as this very seriously, and we want to provide you with an opportunity to investigate and inquire if you need additional details.

On May 8, 2020, the ASA discovered that our e-commerce system had been infiltrated by an unauthorized entity, and malicious files were deposited with the intent to capture customer payment card information during transmission upon Submit. At this time, there is no evidence that data stored in our customer database or on our servers has been affected, only information that was being transmitted. It appears that impacted transactions first occurred on April 13, 2020, and were contained by May 8, 2020.

The incident occurred through a flaw in the ASA's customer relationship management software, called IMIS, which is produced by Advanced Solutions International (ASI). The IMIS software contained a flaw that allowed personal information to be compromised.

Affected customers may have had their payment card data, names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses compromised in transmission. Data stored in our customer database and on our server were not affected. The ASA does not retain payment card information in our database or on our server.

Upon discovery of the infiltration, the ASA immediately disabled its e-commerce site and began an investigation into the extent of the compromise. We have contacted law enforcement. We have retained the services of Trustwave, a security expert, to assist us in determining how the unauthorized entity was able to get through our security, what information was stolen, how to remedy the situation, and how to prevent further attacks. If the forensic investigation reveals any change in the information about this incident, we will notify you promptly of any material information by way of another notification letter. We are working closely with major card companies Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express, as well as law enforcement to ensure the incident is properly addressed.

To help protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM. This product provides you with superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft.

Notice of Data Breach

Name,

On behalf of Cognizant Technology Solutions, I am writing to inform you about a recent incident that may have involved your Cognizant corporate credit card. We regret that this incident occurred and take the security of your personal information seriously.

WHAT HAPPENED.

We recently discovered that Cognizant was the victim of a ransomware attack carried out by international cyber criminals. On April 20, 2020, Cognizant learned that the attackers staged and likely exfiltrated a limited amount of data from Cognizant's systems. Based on our investigation, we understand that this activity occurred between April 9 and 11.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED.

The majority of the personal information that was impacted was information relating to our corporate credit cards. Out of an abundance of caution, we are giving notice to all associates who have an active corporate credit card. All associates who have an active corporate credit card will be offered credit and identity theft monitoring services from ID Experts, as detailed below.

WHAT WE ARE DOING.

We notified the issuer of the cards of impacted accounts. They continue to monitor the account for any fraudulent activity and we have been informed that they have not seen an increase in fraud for our accounts. Cognizant is taking this security incident very seriously. We have been cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with their investigation of the cyber criminals responsible for the attack. In addition to quickly containing the incident, we are also taking various steps to further improve Cognizant's overall security posture.

WHAT YOU CAN DO.

While we have no reason to believe that any fraudulent activity has been carried out on the accounts, to assist you and consistent with law, we are providing you with the following information about general steps you can take to protect against potential misuse of personal information. As a precaution, we have arranged for you, at your option, to enroll in a complimentary 12-month credit and dark web monitoring service provided by ID Experts, which also includes identity theft insurance coverage and managed identity restoration services. You have until September 18, 2020, to activate this complimentary service by using the following activation code: [Enrollment Code]. This code is unique for your use and should not be shared.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

You should always remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft, including by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions.

In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or law enforcement, including your Attorney General, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC's website, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338) or write to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228.

You may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:

Equifax Experian TransUnion

In addition, you may obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes.

You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file.

In addition, you can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a security freeze to restrict access to your credit report:

(1) Equifax (800) 685-1111
(2) Experian (888) 397-3742
(3) TransUnion (888) 909-8872

You will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your request, each credit reporting agency will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN or password that you will need in order to lift or remove the freeze. You should keep the PIN or password in a safe place.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Subject: Aeries Security Breach

Dear Charter Alternative Program Parents,

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that affected the Aeries Student Information System. This system stores and provides access to certain student and parent information for schools across the United States. Although we do not believe there is any reason to be concerned, we wanted to inform you about what happened.

On May 6th, 2020, we received information that there may have been unauthorized access to the Aeries SIS on November 4th, 2019. This may have revealed Parent and Student Login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and password hashes. Although a password hash is an encrypted password (not visible), unauthorized persons may be able to deconstruct weak, common or simple passwords, which would enable the person to access unauthorized Parent and Student Accounts and data stored in the Aeries SIS. Based on the report we received from Aeries, no other data stored in our AERIES database was affected, including grades, credits, & transcripts.

We have been informed that local and federal law enforcement officials were notified of the incident, charges were filed on a single individual, and the investigation is continuing. While there is no evidence to suggest that data was misused, we will be resetting the account passwords for all Charter parents out of an abundance of caution tomorrow, May 19th. As an added precaution against the possibility of future such incidents, we will be enforcing stricter password security guidelines, which will require the following:

- Minimum Length: 8 Characters
- Require a Special Character
- Require Letters and Numbers
- Require Upper and Lower case

Upon being made aware of the incident, Aeries Software took action to ensure the security of the system and has taken additional technical measures to prevent future incidents, including adopting new security protocols. We will continue to work closely with Aeries Software to ensure that your data remains as secure as possible.

If you suspect your personal information has been misused, you can visit the FTC's site at IdentityTheft.gov to get further information. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]	The contents of the data breach notification letter suggest that this was an outside party who may have gained unauthorized access to the Aeries Student Information System.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity: As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Copy of Credit Report: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze: Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity: As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Copy of Credit Report: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze: Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost.

A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

2. Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File.

Whether or not you choose to use the complimentary 12-month credit monitoring services, we recommend that you place an initial 1-year fraud alert on your credit files, at no charge. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you personally before they open any new accounts. To place a fraud alert, call any one of the three major credit bureaus at the numbers listed below. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, they will notify the others.

Equifax P.O. Box 105069 Atlanta, GA 30348 www.equifax.com 1-800-525-6285
Experian P.O. Box 2002 Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion LLC P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016 www.transunion.com 1-800-680-7289

3. Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File.

If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a security freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by sending a request in writing or by mail, to all three nationwide credit reporting companies. To find out more about how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information:

Equifax Security Freeze P.O. Box 105788 Atlanta, GA 30348 https://www.freeze.equifax.com 1-800-685-1111
Experian Security Freeze P.O. Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 http://experian.com/freeze 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion LLC P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016 www.transunion.com 1-800-680-7289

In order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit monitoring company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the City in which you currently reside.

If you do place a security freeze prior to enrolling in the credit monitoring service as described above, you will need to remove the freeze to sign up for the credit monitoring service. After you sign up for the credit monitoring service, you may refreeze your credit file.

Steps You Can Take to Further Help Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state. Contact information for the FTC is: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20580, www.consumer.ftc.gov and www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-438-4338.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<FirstName>> <<MiddleName>> <<LastName>> <<NameSuffix>>:

<<b2b_text_1(CompanyName)>>, (GAIN), is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you that we recently identified and addressed a data security incident that may have involved your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On May 15, 2020, GAIN concluded its investigation of an incident involving some of our systems. GAIN first learned of suspicious system activity on April 15, 2020, during a routine review of login activity. Upon identifying the suspicious activity, GAIN immediately started an investigation with the assistance of a leading cyber security firm. Through this investigation, GAIN determined that an unauthorized party may have accessed some of our computer servers between the dates of April 14, 2020 and April 18, 2020. Upon learning of this, GAIN secured the involved servers and took them offline.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

We have undertaken a comprehensive review of the data that could have potentially been accessed as a result of the incident and have determined that the data related to some of our current and former customers. The information included your name in combination with your <<b2b_text_2(impactedData)>>. Your Social Security number was NOT involved in this incident. To date, we do not have any evidence that any of your information has been misused.

WHAT WE ARE DOING:

To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, GAIN has implemented additional security measures, including the deployment of enhanced monitoring and alerting software.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:

We remind you to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your financial account statements for any suspicious activity. You should immediately report any suspicious activity to your financial institution. Please see the pages that follow this notice for additional steps you may take.

FOR MORE INFORMATION:

If you have any questions, please call 1-877-FOREXGO (367-3946), Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time.

Sincerely,

<<b2b_text_3(SignatoryInfo)>>

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111

Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742

TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts:

There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes:

You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports?

There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.

For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com

TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com

Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze?

A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	The unauthorized party may have accessed some of the computer servers between April 14, 2020 and April 18, 2020, indicating a hack by an outside party.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear FIRST_NAME:

Joseph J. Gormley, CPA values and respects your privacy and is committed to keeping your information confidential. Our commitment to these values includes notifying individuals if we believe that the confidentiality of their personal information may have been compromised. Accordingly, we are writing to advise you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information. We take the privacy and protection of your personal information very seriously and highly recommend you carefully review the information contained in this letter to best protect yourself in the future.

What Happened?

On May 5, 2020, we were informed that our server experienced an intrusion. The intruder or intruders placed malware on our server and by doing so, may have gained access to our customers' names, addresses, social security numbers, tax returns, and information used to file tax returns. We retained outside vendors to evaluate our system and corrective action was immediately implemented. The investigation is continuing and we are unable to affirmatively confirm which files, if any, were actually accessed. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying those whose information was potentially accessed.

What Information Was Involved?

The information may have included names, addresses, social security numbers, tax returns, and information used to file tax returns.

What We Are Doing

Cyber-attacks continue to increase and evolve. For this reason, and to help prevent this type of incident in the future, we are actively enhancing our data security procedures. We have removed all malicious code on our system, enabled other cybersecurity layers of protection, and have implemented security upgrades to our system. We are currently in the process of communicating with all necessary consumer reporting and governmental agencies.

What You Can Do

1. Change your passwords on any accounts that may have been breached and remember to use unique passwords across different accounts.

2. Remain vigilant and monitor your credit and identity by reviewing your account statements and monitor credit reports for any unauthorized activity. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

3. Initiate a Fraud alert which will warn lenders that you may have been a fraud victim. When you request a fraud alert be added with any of the three major credit bureaus, the bureau you contacted will notify the other two and alerts will be added with those bureaus as well. This extra precaution will notify any potential lenders that they should contact you before granting any new line of credit in your name. This fraud alert will stay on your credit report for 90 days, and you can renew the fraud alert when it expires.

4. Keep an eye on your financial accounts by visiting your online bank and financial accounts, and setting up any alert features they may have. This may keep you notified of any unusual activity, should it occur.

5. Report any suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, or the Federal Trade Commission.

6. Place a Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed below in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze.

In order to request a security freeze, you may need to provide all the following information:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);

2. Social Security Number;

3. Date of birth;

4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;

5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;

6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.)

7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft;

Re: Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear <<Name >>,

I am writing on behalf of Ketterer Company (Ketterer) to inform you of a potential data security incident that may have involved your personal information. Ketterer takes the privacy and security of sensitive information very seriously. This is why I am notifying you of the incident and informing you about steps you can take to protect your personal information.

What Happened?

Ketterer is a vendor that hosts the KnightsGear.com website for the Knights of Columbus. Ketterer has learned that malicious scripting designed to harvest consumer information was present on KnightsGear.com from February 7 to May 6, 2020. On February 24, 2020, we received an alert from security software that was monitoring the KnightsGear.com website that prompted us to begin an investigation. We engaged a digital forensics firm to help us determine what happened and confirm whether customer information may have been accessed.

While the investigation was ongoing, from March 31, 2020 until May 7, 2020, we closed the online store in response to COVID-19 social distancing measures. On May 13, 2020, the investigation confirmed that personal information input into the KnightsGear.com website by customers while the scripting was present on the KnightsGear.com website may have been compromised. Based on our records, you made a purchase on the KnightsGear.com website during the identified timeframe.

What Information Was Involved?

Based on our investigation, the affected personal information may include your name, address, email address, payment card number, CVV, and expiration date.

What Are We Doing?

As soon as we discovered the incident, we took the steps described above. In addition, based on the findings of the investigation, we have added additional safeguards to minimize the chance that an incident like this could occur in the future.

What You Can Do:

We encourage you to review and follow the recommendations included with this notice. In addition, we recommend that you carefully review your payment card account statements, and if you find any suspicious activity report it to the financial institution that issued the account. You can also report any suspected fraudulent activity to local law enforcement.

For More Information:

We sincerely apologize for any concern this situation may cause you. If you have any questions, please call 1-833-579-1110 Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

Sincerely,

Thomas Ketterer
President
Ketterer Company

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened

Eagle Community Credit Union (Eagle CCU) is committed to the privacy of individuals and takes the protection of personal information that is entrusted to us seriously. This commitment extends to notifying individuals when their personal information may be at risk. Although we have no reason to believe that your information has been used to commit fraud or identity theft, we are writing to make you aware of a recent data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

We recently discovered that, on February 24, 2020, someone outside of Eagle CCU temporarily accessed an Eagle CCU's employee email account without authorization. Upon learning of the situation, we promptly contained the incident the morning of February 24, 2020 by securing the employee email account to prevent further access and began an initial internal investigation into the incident. We also hired a leading forensic security firm to further investigate the incident and confirm the security of our computer systems and network. The security firm's investigation showed no internal wrongdoing and verified Eagle CCU computer systems and network are secure.

On April 22, 2020, our investigation determined that the email account contained some of your personal information. At this point, we do not believe that the unauthorized third party's motivation was to access the personal information contained in the email account and have no indication that any such information has been used for fraud or identity theft purposes. Nonetheless, we are providing you with this notice because your personal information was contained in the relevant account. We are also committed to taking steps to help prevent something like this from happening again, including reviewing our technical controls and increased security training for all staff members.

What We Are Doing

Although we are not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of Experian IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorks Credit 3B is completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on identity theft prevention and IdentityWorks Credit 3B, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

What Information Was Involved

As part of our investigation, we searched for any personal information that could have been viewed. The impacted information contained in the relevant email account varied by individual but may have included your name, financial account information, and/or your Social Security number.

What You Can Do

As a precautionary measure, we recommend you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Other Important Information

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes and steps to you can take to avoid identity theft. For more information and to contact the FTC, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You may also contact the FTC at: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Credit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information:

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Subject: Aeries Data Security Incident - June 24, 2020

Dear Saddleback Valley Unified School District Families,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that affected Aeries, the District's Student Information System (SIS). Aeries SIS stores and provides access to certain student and parent information for Saddleback Valley Unified School District. We are one of the hundreds of districts using Aeries SIS that was affected by this incident. SVUSD has been a customer of Aeries for over 10 years, and in that time has had no unauthorized access or data incidents with this software. We do not believe there is any reason to be alarmed or unduly concerned, but we wanted you to be informed about what happened.

Timeline with the information provided to us from Aeries:

On April 27, 2020, we were informed there may have been unauthorized access to the Aeries SIS on November 4th, 2019. The initial report was focused on Aeries Hosted Databases, which we do not use. Our Student Information System is housed on-premise on our own servers. On May 6, 2020, SVUSD learned that the Aeries incident may have also impacted on-premise databases. Following directions provided by Aeries, we immediately contacted Aeries and received confirmation that our data was also accessed.

This incident may have revealed Parent and Student Login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and encrypted passwords. However, no other data elements were impacted because of this incident. Social security numbers, credit card data, or other personal information is not kept in our Aeries database. With access to encrypted passwords, unauthorized people may be able to deconstruct weak, common, or simple passwords and subsequently enable unauthorized access to parent and student Accounts and data stored in the Aeries SIS.

We have been informed that local and federal law enforcement officials were notified of the incident, charges were filed, and the people responsible were arrested. The investigation of their misconduct is continuing. While there is no evidence to suggest that your specific data was misused, out of an abundance of caution, we will reset the account passwords for all parents beginning Wednesday, June 24, 2020. To reset your password, please follow the Forgot Password link on the Aeries Parent/Student Portal. Beginning Thursday, June 25, 2020, both parents and students will be able to view the new student password in the Family portal by navigating to Student Info > Student Data. Students will begin using their new password Monday, July 6, 2020.

Further, we are encouraging stricter password security guidelines as an added precaution against the possibility of future such incidents. All new passwords should employ the following guidelines:

- Recommend Users to Change Passwords Every 6 months (minimum)
- Recommend Minimum Length: 8-16 Characters
- Recommend a Special Character
- Require Letters and Numbers
- Recommend Upper and Lower Case Letters

We have no reason to believe that any data was accessed revealing sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. Saddleback Valley Unified School District does not ask nor keep this type of information associated with your Aeries account. Nevertheless, if you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the Federal Trade Commission's site at IdentityTheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

For links and more information, go to https://click.svusd.org/SVUSD-Cyber-Security. Here you will also see what actions Aeries is taking to prevent this from happening to our school district and others in the future.

If you have any questions, including how to reset your password, please email portalsupport@SVUSD.org or call the help desk line at (949) 855-4357 Monday through Friday from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM, and one of our SVUSD Technology Services staff will respond and help you in a timely manner.

Thank you,

Dear Parent,

Adelanto Elementary School District (the District) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents. We are writing to address a recent incident that involved your data. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?
On April 27th, 2020, Aeries Software notified over 150 school districts, including AESD, that their system was breached. The District uses the Aeries Student Information System to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. In late November 2019, Aeries learned that an unauthorized individual exploited a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. Upon discovery, Aeries and law enforcement launched an investigation and believe they have the person responsible in custody.

What Information Was Involved?
The information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password (form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties) for the Aeries System.

What You Can Do?
Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. Even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, you will be required to change your password upon next login. Additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

What We Are Doing
We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. In order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. To help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that Aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our Aeries system. In addition, we and Aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

For More Information
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions, please call 1(760)5307693 between 8:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Pacific, email helpdesk@aesd.net, or visit https://www.aesd.net/AeriesBreach.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear Parent of FN LN,

Red Bluff Joint Union High School District (the District) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents. We are writing to address a recent incident that may have involved your data. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

The District uses the Aeries Student Information System to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. In late November 2019, Aeries learned that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. Aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. Upon discovery, Aeries began an investigation and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who Aeries believes is now in police custody. On May 3rd, 2020, we learned that this individual may have accessed the District's Aeries System. We then conducted our investigation, and on May 6th, 2020, determined that the individual did access parent and student data in the District's Aeries System.

What Information Was Involved?

The information accessible to the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties for the Aeries System. The following email accounts associated with your student were affected: ACCOUNTS.

What You Can Do

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. Even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, we recommend you change your password the next time you sign into your account. Additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

What We Are Doing

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. In order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are recommending all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. To help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that Aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to potentially access our Aeries system. In addition, we and Aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

For More Information

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions, please call the district office at 530-529-8704, or email questions@rbhsd.org.

Sincerely,

Todd Brose
Superintendent	An unauthorized individual successfully exploited a vulnerability in the Aeries student information system software, leading to access to parent and student data, including sensitive personally identifiable information such as names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and hashed passwords.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear [ORIGINAL FIRST NAME] [ORIGINAL MIDDLE NAME] [ORIGINAL LAST NAME] [EXTRA1]:

At Salinas Valley Memorial Healthcare System (SVMHS), we understand that the confidentiality and security of your personal information is critically important, and we are committed to protecting it. This letter is to notify you of a recent cyber incident that affected SVMHS and may have resulted in a compromise of certain electronic files containing your personal information.

What Happened

On April 30, 2020, SVMHS determined that the email account of one of its employees had been compromised. On May 7, 2020, and June 5, 2020, respectively, SVMHS subsequently determined that email accounts of a contractor and three other employees were also compromised. These five email accounts were compromised through Outlook Web Access, SVMHS's browser-based email access solution.

Based on our review of the emails within the compromised inboxes, we determined that an email containing your personal information was present in one of the inboxes. Our investigation to date has suggested, however, that the unauthorized person(s) only had access to the inboxes for a matter of hours before we disabled access to the accounts. We also have no evidence at this time to suggest that the unauthorized person(s) viewed, retrieved or copied your personal information.

What Information Was Involved

The personal information about you in the email in the affected inbox may have included identifying information, such as your name, hospital account number or medical record number, in combination with health information about you, such as your service location and your attending physician's information. The personal information about you in the email did not include your social security, driver's license or bank account numbers.

What We Are Doing

SVMHS disabled access and then reset the passwords to the affected email accounts. Further, we implemented additional security measures such as two-factor authentication to Outlook Web Access for all SVMHS email accounts. We have also taken other steps to try to prevent similar incidents in the future.

We note that this notification was not delayed as a result of any law enforcement investigation. We notified the California Department of Public Health and are notifying the California Attorney General and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights of this incident.

Though we believe the likelihood that the unauthorized person(s) viewed, retrieved or copied your personal information is low, as a precautionary measure to safeguard your information from potential misuse, we are partnering with Experian to provide its Experian IdentityWorks product for one year at no charge to you. A description of this product is provided in the attached material, which also contains instructions about how to enroll (including your personal activation code). If you choose to take advantage of the Experian IdentityWorks product, it will provide you with identity theft detection and resolution of identity theft services as described in the attached material. In order for us to activate this service, you must complete the enrollment	The breach was caused by an outside party who gained unauthorized access to the email accounts of a contractor and three employees through Outlook Web Access. There is evidence that an email containing personal information, such as name, medical record number, service location, and attending physician's information, was present in one of the compromised inboxes. The breach notification letter states that SVMHS does not have evidence that the unauthorized person(s) viewed, retrieved or copied any personal information.

If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name, or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the city in which you currently reside.

If you do place a security freeze prior to enrolling in the credit monitoring service as described above, you will need to remove the freeze in order to sign up for the credit monitoring service.

Dear [NAME OF RECIPIENT]:

EDP Renewables North America LLC (EDPR NA) values its landowners and is committed to protecting your personal information. Unfortunately, we recently learned that we were the victim of a cyber-attack. We are writing to inform you about this information security incident and to share with you the steps EDPR NA is taking to address it.

On April 13, 2020, EDPR NA's parent corporation experienced a ransomware attack on its information systems.

5. You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit file without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. Please understand that placing a security freeze on your credit file may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make for a new loan, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.

A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.

To Whom It May Concern:

I write on behalf of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (Cognizant), to inform you about a recent incident in which Cognizant was the victim of a ransomware attack through which personal information relating to New Hampshire residents was accessed by an unauthorized third party.

On April 20, 2020, Cognizant learned that the attackers staged and likely exfiltrated a limited amount of data from Cognizant's systems, primarily relating to internal tax and finance documents. Based on our investigation, we understand that this exfiltration occurred between April 9 and 11.

Through our investigation, we have determined that the impacted data included instances of the following categories of personal information mostly relating to current and former employees, and also a limited number of contractors and employees of or other individuals related to previously or potential acquired companies: name and Social Security number and/or financial account information. While we have not seen any public disclosure of the data and have no reason to believe it has been misused, we will begin providing notice to approximately 10 individuals residing in New Hampshire about this incident.

As part of our investigation, we also found documentation used to manage our internal corporate credit card program that contained instances of employee corporate cardholder name and card number, and expiration date in some instances. We provided notice to the issuer of the cards about these accounts and we have been informed that they have not seen an increase in fraudulent activity on these accounts. While we do not believe that this will create a risk of harm to our employees relating to this information, out of an abundance of caution we are notifying all of our employees who have active corporate credit card accounts. We will begin providing notice to approximately 125 employees with active corporate credit card accounts residing in New Hampshire.

We are providing these individuals with an offer for complimentary credit monitoring, dark web monitoring, and identity theft insurance and recovery services provided by ID Experts. An individual can enroll in these services online at https://ide.myidcare.com/cognizant or by calling +1-833-579-1114.

Please find attached samples of the letters we will be sending to these individuals. In the event we notify a material additional number of individuals residing in New Hampshire, we will update your office.

Cognizant is taking this security incident very seriously. We have been cooperating with the FBI in connection with their own investigation of the cyber criminals responsible for the attack. In addition to quickly containing the incident, we are also taking steps to further enhance Cognizant's overall security posture. Cognizant maintains a written information security program.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

We are writing on behalf of our client, The New York City Bar Association and the City Bar Fund (collectively "the City Bar"), to notify you of a data security incident involving one of its third-party vendors, Advanced Solutions International ("ASI"). ASI is the developer of the iMIS software, a member management and e-commerce platform that the City Bar uses on its website, www.nycbar.org.

On April 30, 2020, the City Bar was alerted to suspicious activity that involved its website's e-commerce portal. Upon learning of this, the City Bar removed the unauthorized code from the iMIS platform hosted on its web server and launched an investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm.

Through this investigation, completed on May 20, 2020, the City Bar identified unauthorized code designed to capture cardholder data had been inserted in the web server that hosts the iMIS ecommerce platform on its website. The unauthorized code was present on the City Bar's website between April 23, 2020 and May 1, 2020, during which time it could have captured cardholder data submitted by consumers who placed orders or made donations following completion of the checkout process.

The investigation concluded that the unauthorized code was capable of potentially capturing cardholder names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and card security codes (CVV).

Beginning on June 30, 2020, the City Bar will mail a notification letter via United States Postal Service First-Class mail to one New Hampshire resident whose cardholder data may have been involved in this incident, in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 359-C:20.1. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed. This does not waive the City Bar's objection that New Hampshire lacks personal jurisdiction over it regarding any claims relating to this incident.

To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, the City Bar has implemented advanced malware protection software with enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

Gerald J. Ferguson

As a precautionary measure, Urban Compass, Inc. is writing to inform you about a phishing incident that affected some of our agents' Gmail accounts. This incident may have involved some of your information. We take your privacy seriously, and this notice explains the incident, the measures we have taken, and the steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

We discovered that some of our agents' Gmail accounts were accessed without authorization due to a phishing attack. A phishing attack is a common cyber-attack that tricks email recipients into believing that the message is from a trustworthy entity and to click a malicious link or download a malicious attachment. We conducted an internal investigation, and a leading computer forensic firm was hired to assist. The investigation revealed that an unauthorized person gained access to the Gmail accounts between May 24, 2019, and November 6, 2019, and again between November 11, 2019, and January 8, 2020. The investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized person actually viewed any emails or attachments in the accounts.

What Information Was Involved?

As a precaution, we reviewed the emails and attachments in the agents' Gmail accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized person. From this review, in April 2020, we determined that the accounts may have contained your <<b2b_text_1 (Impacted Data)>><<b2b_text_2 (Impacted Data)>>.

Dear Martinelli, Marcus H:

Steel Partners values our employees and stakeholders and understands the importance of protecting personal information. We are writing to inform you about an incident that may involve some of your information. This incident may have involved personal information concerning you that was collected by a Steel Partners entity relating to your employment, your status as a beneficiary of a current or former employee, your participation in a pension plan, or your status as a beneficiary of a pension plan participant. Steel Partners entities include Steel Partners, portfolio companies of Steel Partners, and pension plans administered by Steel Partners. This letter is intended to replace the letter mailed to you on June 29, 2020, and provides you with additional information obtained through our investigation.

What Happened

Steel Partners recently discovered unauthorized activity in the email account of one of its employees. It immediately initiated an investigation, which identified unauthorized access to that email account. Steel Partners locked the account and promptly engaged a forensic security firm to assist. The investigation identified that a security breach may have occurred on April 18, 2020, when the email account was accessed using a method that allowed for a local download of the entire mailbox. On May 29, 2020, it was determined that there were documents within the employee's email account that contained personal information. A broader review of our systems indicated that only one email account was impacted. We are notifying you because some of your personal information was contained in documents within the Steel Partners employee's email account.

What Information Was Involved

The impacted email account contained documents that may have contained your first name, last name, social security number, and date of birth or health information related to disability or workers' compensation claims.

What You Can Do

While we have no indication that your personal information has been misused, we encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports. If you detect any unauthorized activity, you should promptly notify the appropriate institution. Please find more information on protecting your identity in the guidance attached to this letter.

Dear Sirs or Madams:

We write on behalf of our client, Accedian Networks US Inc. ("Accedian"), to notify you of a security incident that resulted in the unauthorized access of the personal information of one New Hampshire resident.

On May 15, 2020, Accedian discovered it was the victim of a ransomware attack. The external threat actor was able to gain access to Accedian's systems, infecting certain systems with ransomware and exfiltrating data off of certain servers in the system. Once Accedian became aware it had been subject to a ransomware attack, the system was contained by shutting down all servers and machines. Accedian also immediately put in place an incident response plan and retained forensic experts to contain the incident and determine its scope.

Additional containment and responsive measures taken include:
- Password reset and multi-factor authentication for all GSuite users;
- Separating routing from Firewall;
- Building a new Firewall to support Web Filtering;
- Building a green network with additional VLANs;
- Revalidating all internal routes(> 5000 IPs);
- Rebuilding an Active Directory (Windows 2016);
- Changing VPN Protocol and security (2 factor authentication+ certificate); and
- Deploying Enterprise wide Antivirus/Malware/End-point security.

During the investigation, the forensic experts advised that there was insufficient evidence from the logs to identify all files accessed by the attacker, and what data was transferred to the attacker's infrastructure during the incident.

On June 3, 2020, however, Accedian received information from the attacker on the files accessed and what data had been transferred during the incident. Upon receipt of this information, Accedian immediately undertook an assessment to determine the scope of individuals affected in the United States. From this review, Accedian determined that the personal information of one New Hampshire resident was accessed by the attacker, including name, address, resume, salary or fee schedule, social security number, tax forms banking details for direct deposit purposes and photo identification.

To help protect the identity of impacted individuals, we are offering a complimentary 2 year membership of identity theft and credit monitoring solutions from CyberScout. This product provides superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft. The affected individual will be notified of the incident on July 2, 2020. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed.

If you have any questions or need further information regarding this incident, please contact me at (514) 971 2497 or julie.himo@nortonrosefulbright.com.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Howard & Howard Attorneys, PLLC ("Howard & Howard"), to notify you of a security incident involving 6 New Hampshire residents.

Howard & Howard conducted an investigation involving unauthorized access to an employee's email account. Upon first learning of the incident, Howard & Howard secured the employee's email account, launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident, and a computer security firm was engaged to assist.

The investigation determined that an unauthorized person had access to the contents of the employee's email account at times between February 1, 2020, and February 12, 2020. The investigation did not determine whether the unauthorized individual viewed or accessed any of the emails in the account; however, Howard & Howard was not able to rule out that possibility.

Howard & Howard searched the contents of the account to identify documents containing personal information. On April 22, 2020, Howard & Howard determined that an email or attachment in the account contained the Social Security numbers of 6 New Hampshire residents.

Beginning on June 30, 2020, Howard & Howard will notify the New Hampshire residents in substantially the same form as the enclosed letter via United States Postal Service First Class Mail in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 359-C:20.

Howard & Howard is offering the New Hampshire individuals a complimentary, one-year membership to credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration services through Experian. Howard & Howard is recommending that individuals remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing their account statements for unauthorized activity.

Howard & Howard has also established a dedicated call center where all individuals may obtain more information regarding the incident.

To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, Howard & Howard is taking steps to enhance its existing security protocols and re-educating its staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Dear Full_Name:

At Howard & Howard, we understand the importance of protecting and securing the personal information that we maintain. I am writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

We conducted an investigation involving unauthorized access to a Howard & Howard employee's email account. Upon first learning of the incident, we secured the employee's email account, launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident, and a computer security firm was engaged to assist.

The investigation determined that an unauthorized person had access to the contents of the employee's email account at times between February 1, 2020, and February 12, 2020. The investigation did not determine whether the unauthorized individual viewed or accessed any of the emails in the account; however, we were not able to rule out that possibility.

We searched the contents of the account to identify documents containing personal information. On April 22, 2020, we determined that an email or attachment contained in the account contained your personal information, including your Variable_Text. Although we cannot confirm your information was viewed, and have no indication that your information has been misused, we wanted to inform you of this incident and offer recommendations on ways to protect your information.

As always, we encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements for any unauthorized activity. As an added precaution, we are also offering you a complimentary one-year membership with Experian's IdentityWorks. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection support.

Dear Attorney General MacDonald,

I am writing to report a breach of security involving personal information of several New Hampshire residents. On May 19, 2020, the Inn at Deerfield, Inc. consulted with a third-party for advice relating to the Inn's accounting software. The Inn granted the third-party remote access to one of the Inn's computers and the financial records stored in the Inn's systems. The third-party's access lasted approximately 20 minutes. This was the Inn's first and only dealing with the third-party software consultant. After the 20-minute interaction, efforts were made to investigate the third-party further, but that investigation could not confirm the third-party's business or corporate credentials.

After being unable to confirm the credentials of the third-party consultant, the Inn retained an information technology provider to wipe clean the one computer the third-party accessed and examine the Inn's other computer systems. Neither the Inn nor the information technology provider believe any data was taken from the Inn's systems, but the third-party was able to access the Inn's records for the 20-minute period. During that time, it is possible the third-party accessed personal information for purposes other than consulting the Inn.

The Inn takes protecting personal information seriously and is providing this notice out of an excess of caution in case the third-party consultant was not in fact a legitimate operation. The information to which the third-party had temporary access was limited to that used for payroll, including name, address, social security number, and in some cases, date of birth and direct deposit banking information. Our investigation indicates that the third-party could have accessed files containing personal information of 372 current and former employees who, based on the information available to the Inn, reside in New Hampshire.

The Inn mailed notices to these 372 individuals by July 3, 2020. The Inn contracted to offer credit monitoring services to these individuals, at no cost to them, for a period of 12 months and provided instructions for enrolling in those services along with the notice sent to them.

The Inn makes significant efforts to protect information, but we regrettably allowed this limited access by a third-party. We have taken steps to examine our systems and believe the incident was limited to the brief, 20-minute access by the third-party. We have taken steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The Inn notified law enforcement authorities of this incident, but we did not delay in notifying the affected individuals pending the outcome of a law enforcement investigation.

If you have any questions or concerns about this incident, please contact me, Kelly Adams, at (855) 255-9404 or at kelly@innatdeerfield.org.

Sincerely,

Kelly Adams
Executive Director
Inn at Deerfield, Inc.	The breach was caused by a third-party accessing the Inn's computer remotely and with unauthorized access. Although the investigation did not confirm the third-party's business credentials, the Inn took steps to investigate their systems, wiped clean the computer that was accessed, and offered credit monitoring services to affected individuals. The incident was reported to law enforcement authorities, and efforts were made to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Breach, Beverly Hills Unified School District:

Dear BHUSD Parents/Guardians,

Beverly Hills Unified School District (the District) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents. We are writing to address a recent incident that may have involved your data. This notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

The District uses the Aeries Student Information System to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. In late November 2019, Aeries learned that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. Aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. Upon discovery, Aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who Aeries believes is now in police custody. On April 27, 2020, we were notified by Aeries that this individual may have accessed the District's Aeries System. We then contacted Aeries, and on May 5, 2020, we were informed that the individual did access parent and student data within the District's Aeries System.

What Information Was Involved?

The information accessible to the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties - for the Aeries System.

What You Can Do

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. Even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, we have increased security for passwords. You will be required to change your password to comply with the bulleted list below. You will be required to do so the next time you log on to the Aeries Parent Portal. We recommend you do so immediately. Additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well. Although this incident was the result of a vulnerability in Aeries system, not the District's, we have taken this opportunity to review the District's security as well. To further strengthen account security, your new password must include the following:

- Lower case letters
- At least one (1) upper case letter
- At least 1 special character
- At least 1 number
- At least eight (8) characters.

What We Are Doing

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. In order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. To help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that Aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to potentially access our Aeries system. In addition, we and Aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

For More Information

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you need technical assistance or support, please email tech@bhusd.org. We have also posted a Frequently Asked Questions page for you here. If you have questions or concerns not addressed in the FAQ, please contact David Damico (Executive Director of Technology Services and Support) at ddamico@bhusd.org.

Dear Member,

Subject: Notice of Data Breach

Central California Alliance for Health (the Alliance) has been informed of a data security breach that may have involved unintentional disclosure of our members' health information. Alliance employees' email accounts were accessed, but there is no proof to suggest that any member health information is being misused at this time. The Alliance wants to ensure that members who may have been affected are notified that their health information may have been disclosed.

What Happened:

On May 7, 2020, the Alliance found that many Alliance employees' email accounts were accessed illegally by an unknown person. These accounts were accessed for about one hour. The Alliance found the issue and immediately shut down the Alliance employees' email accounts that were accessed.

What Information Was Involved:

- Alliance Care Management program records
- Claims information

- Demographic information
- Medi-Cal ID number
- Medical information
- Referral information

The Alliance employees' email accounts would not have included financial information and social security numbers.

What We Are Doing:

The Alliance took immediate efforts to shut down the Alliance employees' email accounts that were involved to make sure the unknown person could not access any more member health information. All Alliance employees, even those not involved in the data security breach, were asked to change their email password information to ensure all email accounts were secured. Also, all Alliance employees were required to take a training on preventing these types of data security breaches.

What You Can Do:

We suggest that you keep a copy of this notice for your records in case there are any concerns with your medical records in the future. No further action is required of you.

You have the right to review your Alliance billing information at no charge in order to ensure that your Alliance ID number has not been misused. To review your Alliance billing information, you can request a copy of your records by submitting a Records Access Request Form to the Alliance.

(Enclosure)
Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your MyIDCare membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-833-431-1276 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help.

If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069
Atlanta, GA 30348-5069

TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.	The breach occurred on May 25, 2020, when an individual gained unauthorized access to their databases and systems containing personal health information and medical records on their patients.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Re: Mortgage Loan Notice of Data Breach

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that occurred with one of our due diligence vendors that we hired to perform services on some of our loans, including yours. We also want to let you know about the services we are offering to you at no charge to help protect your continued privacy. At this time, we have no reason to believe that your personal information has been accessed or used inappropriately. However, we are writing this letter to explain what happened, what information was involved, what we have done, and what you can do to protect your continued privacy.

First, we want to explain why we have your personal information. Mortgage lenders often sell mortgage loans after they have made them. Selling the loans replenishes their funds and enables them to maintain a continuous flow of mortgage funding for new loans. In your case, your mortgage loan was sold to us, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Because you make or have made your mortgage payments to a different company, you probably haven't had direct interactions with Freddie Mac. The company that you make your mortgage payments to (which may be the lender who originally made the loan to you) is responsible for processing your payments and providing you with customer service. The fact that you are receiving this letter from us does not mean that there has been any change in your mortgage or your relationship with that other company.

What Happened?

We recently learned that earlier this year, a vendor we hired to perform due diligence services on some of our loans experienced a ransomware attack on its systems. Because the incident left the vendor's system inaccessible to the vendor, the vendor does not know all details of the incident or the information affected.

What Information Was Involved?

While we have no indication that your personal information was accessed or used inappropriately, we have determined that your information, including your loan application data (e.g., name, address, social security number, date of birth, credit and bank account information), was on the vendor's systems at the time of the incident. The vendor has informed us that it has not found any evidence that your personal information, which was encrypted as required by our contract with them, was accessed or taken from its systems by the attackers. However, given the nature and circumstances of the attack, we decided, as a precautionary measure, to make credit	The breach was caused by a ransomware attack on a due diligence vendor's systems, leaving the vendor's system inaccessible and compromising the vendor's information.

RE: Important Notice of Data Incident. Please read this entire letter.

Dear [Insert name],

We are contacting you as a client of Douglas M. Smith & Company, CPAs, to report that between March 31 and April 1, 2020, four (4) tax returns electronically filed by our firm were rejected, apparently because fraudulent returns had already been filed for those taxpayers. Your tax return was NOT rejected, and there is no evidence of any suspicious activity relating to your return; however, as required by law, we are providing this notification to all our clients. We are also providing one year of complimentary credit monitoring, fraud monitoring, and $1,000,000 in Identity Theft Insurance for all clients and their dependents in an abundance of caution. Enrollment instructions are provided below under Credit Monitoring.

We are working with the IRS and Secret Service to ensure that every client receives a full refund, including those identified on any fraudulent returns, and we have directed the IRS to flag your account to prevent anyone other than our office from filing a return on your behalf. Rest assured, no client needs to worry about losing their refund.

WHAT HAPPENED
Between March 31, 2020, and April 1, 2020, four (4) electronically filed tax returns were rejected by the Intuit Lacerte tax preparation software, which Lacerte reported was due to the fact that returns were previously filed for those taxpayers. We immediately reported this incident to the IRS, Secret Service, Fresno Police, and FBI, and, working with Lacerte, identified a total of 30 fraudulent returns. You are not among the individuals identified on the 30 fraudulent returns.

We also immediately retained forensic investigators to conduct an investigation, and, to date, we have found no evidence that any unauthorized individual has accessed our computer systems, where your personal information is stored.

IS MY TAX RETURN SAFE?
Yes, all returns are safe. Mr. Smith has contacted the IRS and Secret Service regarding the 30 fraudulently filed returns and is re-filing those returns in paper format to ensure refunds are paid in full. We have also directed the IRS to flag you and all other clients and dependents to prevent filings attempted by anyone other than our office. No client will need to worry about losing their refund.

WHAT INFORMATION IS INVOLVED
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no suspicious activity with respect to you or any other clients and dependents who were not identified on the 30 impacted returns. For the 30 fraudulent returns, the taxpayers' Social Security Number, along with public information including name, address, and date of birth, was used to file the return. You are not impacted by the 30 fraudulent returns, but your Social Security Number is stored on our server, which is why we are legally required to provide this notification.

WHAT WE ARE DOING
We immediately notified the IRS of the 30 impacted returns and directed the IRS to flag you and all other clients and dependents to prevent anyone other than our office from filing returns for those individuals. We also retained forensic investigators to analyze our computer systems and information and hired a new IT and cybersecurity firm to manage all security going forward. And, we are providing one year of credit monitoring, fraud monitoring, and $1,000,000 in Identity Theft Insurance for all clients and dependents in an abundance of caution to minimize the risk of identity theft.

CREDIT MONITORING
We are providing you with one year of access to Triple Bureau Credit Monitoring/Triple Bureau Credit Report/Public Records monitoring/Cyber Monitoring* services at no charge. These services provide you with alerts for twelve months from the date of enrollment when changes occur to any of one of your Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion credit files. This notification is sent to you the same day that the change or update takes place with the bureau. Also, the following public records will be monitored: Change of Address, Court Records, and Social Security number trace, Payday Loan, and Sex Offender. The cyber monitoring will review the dark web and alert you if your personally identifiable information is found online.

In addition, we are providing you with proactive fraud assistance to help with any questions that you might have or in the event you become a victim of identity theft. These services will be provided by CyberScout, a company that specializes in identity theft education and resolution.

To enroll in Credit Monitoring* services at no charge, please log on to https://www.myidmanager.com and follow the instructions provided. When prompted, please provide the following unique code to receive services: <CODE HERE>.

For guidance with the CyberScout services or to obtain additional information about these services, please call the CyberScout help line 1-800-405-6108 and supply the fraud specialist with your unique code.

WHAT YOU CAN DO
You are encouraged to remain vigilant against identity theft, including over the next twelve to twenty-four months, by regularly reviewing financial account statements and monitoring credit reports for suspicious activity, and to immediately report any unauthorized charges to the card issuer. The phone number to call is usually on the back of the credit or debit card. Any incidents of suspected identity theft may be reported to financial institutions and law enforcement.

Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who may access the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies:

Equifax
P.O. Box 10569
Atlanta, Georgia 30348
1-866-836-3651 / 1-800-525-6285

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place a fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years.

Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies. You may also contact the Federal Trade Commission for additional information regarding consumer protection at:

In closing, we thank you for your business, and we believe we are taking every possible step to protect you following this incident. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no suspicious activity regarding your tax return, and we have found no evidence that any unauthorized individual accessed our computer systems. No client will need to worry about losing their refund, as we continue to work with the IRS and Secret Service regarding the 30 impacted returns and have directed the IRS to flag your account to prevent any fraudulent filings.

We recommend that you enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring, fraud monitoring, and $1,000,000 in Identity Theft Insurance using the instructions referenced above, which service is at no cost to you. If you believe there is any possibility that someone is using your personal information, you can contact a CyberScout personal advocate to work with you in reporting the problem and helping you through the entire identity restoration process.

We thank you again for your business, and if you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate	The tax returns of four clients electronically filed by Douglas M. Smith & Company, CPAs were rejected because fraudulent returns had already been filed for those taxpayers. No suspicious activity was found on this specific client's return and they are providing one year of complimentary credit monitoring, fraud monitoring, and $1,000,000 in Identity Theft Insurance for all clients and their dependents in an abundance of caution.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Claire's Stores, Inc. ("Claire's"), to notify your office of a security incident involving New Hampshire residents.

Claire's began an investigation of its e-commerce websites after it was contacted by a security researcher the night of Thursday, June 11, 2020, who claimed to have determined that Claire's e-commerce site had been compromised. Claire's immediately took action to investigate the security researcher's claim and identified and removed unauthorized code in the code that operates its e-commerce site on Friday, June 12, 2020.

The added code was capable of obtaining information entered by customers during the checkout process and sending it out of the Claire's system. A security firm was engaged, and Claire's identified the specific transactions involved. Claire's also reinforced the security of its site. Purchases made in Claire's retail store locations were not involved	The e-commerce site of Claire's was compromised and unauthorized code was added, which was able to access customer information during the checkout process and exit the Claire's system. A security firm was employed, and specific transactions were identified.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General McDonald:

Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman and Dicker LLP (Wilson Elser) represents Eshel, Aminov & Partners LLP (Eshel Aminov), an accounting and financial services firm, with respect to a potential data security incident (hereinafter, the Incident) described in more detail below. Eshel Aminov takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

1. Nature of the security Incident.

Beginning on or about March 10, 2019 and ending on or about May 20, 2019, Eshel Aminov experienced a business email compromise in which an unknown cyber attacker gained access to Eshel Aminov's business email environment as a result of an email phishing scheme.

Eshel Aminov does not know what, if any, personal information belonging to its clients was either acquired or accessed by the unknown cyber attacker as a result of this Incident. However, the individual responsible for the Incident had the means to access and/or acquire unencrypted documents within Eshel Aminov's business email environment that contained Social Security numbers, financial information, payment card information, and tax-related information of Eshel Aminov's clients.

Again, at this time, Eshel Aminov has no evidence that the cyber attacker actually viewed or acquired any personal information or that any fraud of misuse of any personal information has occurred due to the Incident.

Eshel Aminov first discovered the Incident on or about May 10, 2019, at which time it swiftly took steps to secure its business email environment. Eshel Aminov has since gone to great lengths to identify and notify any individuals who were potentially impacted as result of this incident including (1) a thorough internal review of tens of thousands of client files (2) the hiring of a third-party vendor to organize and process Eshel Aminov client mailing data and (3) the hiring of a third-party vendor to arrange for any potentially affected individuals to receive credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.

2. Number of New Hampshire residents affected.

On or about April 15, 2020, Eshel Aminov finished identifying a population of six (6) New Hampshire residents that were potentially affected by this Incident. Incident notification letters addressed to these individuals were mailed on July 8, 2020, via First Class Mail. A sample copy of the two versions of the Incident notification letters being mailed to potentially affected residents of New Hampshire are included with this letter.

3. Steps taken.

Eshel Aminov has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. These steps include resetting Eshel Aminov employees' access credentials through a global firm-wide password reset, implementing additional layers of security to Eshel Aminov's email platform, and reviewing the ways confidential information is transmitted within the firm. Additionally, Eshel established a new client portal for secure transfer of data. Eshel Aminov has also provided potentially impacted individuals with notice of the Incident and complimentary, online credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to all notified residents of New Hampshire for twelve (12) months.

4. Contact information.

Eshel Aminov remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information within its control. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@wilsonelser.com or (312) 821-6164.

Very truly yours,

Exhibit A

July 1, 2019

Dear [Client Name]:

On or about May 20, 2019 our internal investigation of this incident revealed to us that the incident began on or about March 10, 2019 and ended on or about May 20, 2019. We have had the utmost privilege of serving many clients over the years, and, as such, it has been challenging to notify thousands of past and former clients of this incident all at once. To that end, our efforts have included, among other endeavors (1) expending significant internal resources during the latter half of 2019 in compiling and centralizing information related to individuals who may have been affected by this incident, (2) hiring an outside vendor in early 2020 to examine these records and to extract and process the information needed to properly deliver this notification letter to you, and (3) arranging for the provision of complimentary services, described below, that we are providing to you to help protect your personal information.

We sincerely regret any inconvenience that this incident may cause and can assure you that we have taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. This includes resetting employees' access credentials to ensure our systems are secure, implementing additional layers of security to our email platform, and reviewing the way that confidential information is transmitted within the firm. Additionally, in 2019, we established a new client portal for the secure transfer of data. This portal may be accessed via our website: https://www.eshelcpa.com/.

Subject: Payment Card Incident Notification

Dear <<FirstName>> <<MiddleName>> <<LastName>> <<NameSuffix>>,

Claires and Icing are writing to inform you that we recently identified and addressed an incident that may have involved your payment card information. This notice explains the incident, the measures we have taken in response, and some additional steps you may consider taking.

What Happened?
We recently began an investigation of our e-commerce websites, and on June 12, 2020, we identified and removed computer code that had been added to our site by an unauthorized person. The added code was capable of obtaining information entered by customers during the checkout process and sending that information out of our system. A security firm was engaged, and we identified the specific transactions involved. We also reinforced the security of our site. Purchases made in our retail store locations were not involved.

Findings from the investigation show the code was first added on April 7, 2020. There were several times from April 7 to June 12 when the added code was not present because of new code deployments. We are notifying you because you placed an order during a time the added code was present.

What Information Was Involved?
The information entered during the checkout process that could have been copied includes:

- Contact information - first and last name, address, email address (only if you chose to edit your email on the checkout page), and phone number.
- Payment card information - payment card number, expiration date, and card verification code for the payment card ending in <<b2b_text_2(Last4ofCard)>>. If you made more than one purchase between April 7 and June 12 and used more than one card, you can identify the other cards involved by looking at your email receipt or by calling us at the number below.
- Other information - if you paid with a gift card or created a Claires account during the checkout process, the added code could have copied the gift card number and PIN or the account password (but not email address).

What We Are Doing.
Claires conducted an investigation, implemented additional security measures, and hired resources to inform and assist our customers. We also notified the payment cards network so that they can inform the banks that issued the cards. Claires also notified law enforcement and relevant authorities.

We are also offering a complimentary one-year membership of Experians IdentityWorksSM. This product provides you with internet surveillance and identity theft insurance at no cost to you upon enrollment. To activate your membership and start monitoring your personal information, please follow the steps on page 3.

What You Can Do.
We encourage you to closely review your payment card account statements for any unauthorized charges. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to the bank that issued your card because payment card network rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely reported.

For More Information.
We regret that this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. If you have any further questions or concerns, we established a dedicated call center, which can be reached by calling 1-844-951-2879, Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. 6:30 p.m. EDT, excluding US holidays.

Sincerely,

Marie Hodge

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Claires Stores, Inc. (Claires), to notify your office of a security incident involving Iowa residents.

Claires began an investigation of its e-commerce websites after it was contacted by a security researcher the night of Thursday, June 11, 2020 who claimed to have determined that Claire's e-commerce site had been compromised. Claire's immediately took action to investigate the security researcher's claim and identified and removed unauthorized code in the code that operates its e-commerce site on Friday, June 12, 2020. The added code was capable of obtaining information entered by customers during the checkout process and sending it out of the Claires system. A security firm was engaged, and Claires identified the specific transactions involved. Claires also reinforced the security of its site. Purchases made in Claires retail store locations were not involved.

Findings from the investigation show the code was first added on April 7, 2020. There were several times from April 7 to June 12, 2020 when the added code was not present because of new code deployments. The information entered during the checkout process that could have been copied includes first and last name	The security incident was caused by an unauthorized code that was added to the Claire's e-commerce website which allowed the information entered by customers during the checkout process to be obtained and sent out of the Claire's system.

As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, they will notify the others.

P.O. Box 105069
Atlanta, GA 30348

3. Consider Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File.

If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a Security Freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:

Equifax Security Freeze
P.O. Box 105788
Atlanta, GA 30348
https://www.freeze.equifax.com
1-800-685-1111

Experian Security Freeze
P.O. Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013
http://experian.com/freeze
1-888-397-3742

TransUnion Security Freeze
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19016
http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze
1-888-909-8872

In order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name, or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the city in which you currently reside.

If you do place a security freeze prior to enrolling in the credit monitoring service as described above, you will need to remove the freeze in order to sign up for the credit monitoring service. After you sign up for the credit monitoring service, you may refreeze your credit file.

4. Obtaining a Free Credit Report.

Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We represent the McPherson College (McPherson), headquartered in McPherson, Kansas with respect to a potential data security incident described in more detail below. McPherson takes the security and privacy of their student and employee information very seriously and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

1. Nature of the security incident. On or about October 3, 2019, McPherson College discovered that a single employee's email account may have been compromised. McPherson immediately took action to secure the email account and conduct an investigation into the incident. McPherson proceeded to engage a third-party computer forensics firm to conduct a thorough investigation. That investigation concluded in or about November 2019 and found that a single employee's email account had been compromised. McPherson then proceeded to engage a third-party e-discovery vendor to review the contents of the compromised email account and create a list of individuals that would need to be notified as a result of unknown/unauthorized threat actor accessing the compromised email account. On June 3, 2020, after a thorough and full search of the material accessible within the email account, McPherson received a final list of the names and addresses of the individuals whose information may have been accessed by the unauthorized/unknown third party. The unknown unauthorized threat actor may have been able to access the affected individuals' name in addition to possibly their Passport number, driver's license number, government ID number, credit card number and CVV, student loan information, limited personal health information, and/or date of birth.

2. Number of New Hampshire residents affected. A total of two (2) New Hampshire residents may have been potentially affected by this incident. Notification letters to these individuals were mailed on July 10, 2020, by first-class mail. A sample copy of the notification letter is included with this letter.

3. Steps taken. McPherson takes the security and privacy of the information very seriously and has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future, as well as to protect the privacy and security of potentially impacted individuals' information. These include but are not limited to implementing multi-factor authentication, forcing password changes, strengthening the security of their email tenant, and reporting the incident to the appropriate government regulators as required. Additionally, the affected individuals were provided with credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for a period of 1 year through Epiq.

4. Contact information. McPherson remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information in its control. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@WilsonElser.com or (312) 821-6164.

The information included the residents' full name and Social Security number. Not all information was included for all residents. CIA has no indication that any information has been misused.

Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, CIA wanted to inform you (and the affected residents) of the incident and to explain the steps that it is taking to help safeguard the affected residents against identity fraud. CIA will provide the affected residents notification of this incident commencing on or about July 2, 2020 in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto.

CIA is advising the affected residents about the process for placing a fraud alert and/or security freeze on their credit files and obtaining free credit reports. The affected residents are also being provided with the contact information for the consumer reporting agencies and the Federal Trade Commission.

At CIA, protecting the privacy of personal information is a top priority. CIA is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information in its possession and has taken many precautions to safeguard it. CIA will continue to evaluate and modify its practices and internal controls to enhance the security and privacy of personal information.

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We are writing to notify you of two potential data security incidents involving approximately 77,296 New Hampshire residents.

In 2016, Morgan Stanley closed two data centers and decommissioned computer equipment that processed client information in both locations. As is customary, we contracted with a vendor to remove the data from the devices. We subsequently learned that certain devices believed to have been wiped of all information still contained some unencrypted data (the "Data Center Event").

Separately, in 2019, Morgan Stanley disconnected and replaced computer servers (the "WAAS device") in local branch offices. Those servers had stored information on encrypted disks that may have included personal information. During a recent inventory, we were unable to locate a small number of those devices. The manufacturer subsequently informed us of a software flaw that could have resulted in small amounts of previously deleted data remaining on the disks in unencrypted form (the "WAAS Device Event").

We have worked with outside technical experts to understand the facts and any potential risks for both events. We are not aware of any access to or misuse of personal information in connection with either of these incidents.

For both events, we investigated the disposition and handling of the devices, and worked with outside technical experts to understand any potential risks to customer data in light of the technical characteristics and configuration of each of the relevant devices. In addition, we have continuously monitored active accounts as well as internet and "dark web" forums for any evidence of misuse of Morgan Stanley data and have not detected any unauthorized activity related to the incident.

Nonetheless, we decided that, in an abundance of caution, on July 10, 2020, we would provide notice of the Data Center Event and the WAAS Device Event to individuals whose information may have been on the devices when they left our possession.

Data that potentially could have remained on the devices may have included account names and numbers (at Morgan Stanley and any linked bank accounts), Social Security numbers, passport numbers, contact information, dates of birth, and asset value and holdings data. Note that any data on the devices did not contain credit or debit card numbers or passwords that could be used to access financial accounts.

We are notifying approximately 77,296 New Hampshire residents who may have been affected via a written notice that will be delivered by the U.S. Postal Service or, where electronic communications have been authorized by the customer, via our e-communications system. A sample copy of the notice is attached hereto.

As noted above, we have continuously monitored this situation and have not detected any unauthorized activity relating to this incident. In addition, for any potentially impacted account, we have instituted enhanced security procedures, including continuous fraud monitoring and monitoring of information about malicious online activity and evidence of misuse of any Morgan Stanley data. We have also arranged with Experian to provide any potentially affected individuals with credit monitoring services for 24 months at no charge to them.

Finally, in addition to the measures described above, we have taken steps to further strengthen controls aimed at reducing the risk that such an incident could occur in the future.

To the extent you have any questions about this notification, please contact my colleague, Akinyemi Akiwowo at (212) 537-1592 or Akinyemi.Akiwowo@morganstanley.com for additional information.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

We are writing to inform you of potential data security incidents relating to personal information for your Morgan Stanley account(s).

What Happened

In 2016, Morgan Stanley closed two data centers and decommissioned the computer equipment in both locations. As is customary, we contracted with a vendor to remove the data from the devices. We subsequently learned that certain devices believed to have been wiped of all information still contained some unencrypted data. Separately, in 2019, Morgan Stanley disconnected and replaced a computer server in a local branch office. That server had stored information on encrypted disks that may have included personal information. During a recent inventory, we were unable to locate that device. The manufacturer subsequently informed us of a software flaw that could have resulted in small amounts of previously deleted data remaining on the disks in unencrypted form. We have worked with outside technical experts to understand the facts and any potential risks. We are not aware of any access to, or misuse of, your personal information in connection with either incident. Nonetheless, because it is possible that data associated with your account(s) could have remained on some of the devices when they left our possession, in an abundance of caution, we wanted to make you aware of these matters and what we are doing to protect you.

What Information Was Involved

The data pertaining to your account(s) may have included certain personal information of the individual(s) associated with your account(s), including account names and numbers (at Morgan Stanley and any linked bank accounts), Social Security numbers, [passport numbers,] contact information, date of birth, asset value, and holdings data. The data did not contain Morgan Stanley online passwords.

What We Are Doing

We have continuously monitored these situations and have not detected any unauthorized activity related to the incidents.

Enclosed is a standard reference guide with additional information on the protection of personal information.

We understand the importance you place on data security, and we take our responsibility to protect your information very seriously. We sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern these matters may cause you.

Supplemental Information for the Protection of Personal Information

Avoiding Phishing. Please use caution when responding to third parties who request disclosure of your personal information via email, text, or phone. This may include inquiries from third parties posing as bank officials, information security experts, government agencies, and other trusted sources, in an effort to trick you into divulging your personal information.

You should never provide personal information, such as usernames, passwords, government-issued personal identification numbers (e.g., U.S. Social Security Numbers), account numbers, or any other confidential personal information via email request or screen pop-ups. Legitimate agencies/companies do not ask for this type of information in an email. We will never ask for your account password by email or by phone.

Remain Vigilant. As always, you should monitor your statements for any activity you do not recognize. Contact us immediately to report any suspicious activity.

You also should not click links or open attachments sent from atypical or unknown senders, even if they appear to be legitimate. Pay special attention to links that purportedly take you to websites or other resources related to this incident or offer you services to assist with this incident. When in doubt, call your regular Morgan Stanley contact to verify the legitimacy of the communication.

Ordering Your Free Credit Report. You are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. To order your credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 877-322-8228. We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports.

Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act Rights: You also have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. More information is available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf.

Obtaining a Police Report: You may be entitled by state law to obtain a police report relating to this matter; however, to our knowledge, no such report exists. If you are the victim of identity theft, you also have the right to file a police report and obtain a copy of it.

Fraud Alerts and Security Freezes. You can place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, free of charge, by calling any of the toll-free numbers provided below. Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually. For more information on fraud alerts and security freezes, you also may contact the FTC as described below. You may have to submit personal information to obtain the security freeze, including name, Social Security Number, date of birth, and photograph of a government ID.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear Account Holder,

The Chronicle of Higher Education, Inc. takes data security very seriously, and we understand the importance of protecting the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you about an incident that may have involved some information related to your online account(s) to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and/or chroniclevitae.com. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

WHAT HAPPENED:

On June 19, 2020, The Chronicle completed our investigation of reports we received that some of our data may have become accessible online. Through the investigation, we confirmed that unauthorized parties made data for some online accounts to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and chroniclevitae.com accessible online. Upon learning of this, The Chronicle launched an investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm, and law enforcement was notified. Through the investigation, The Chronicle determined that unauthorized parties had exploited a vulnerability in one of The Chronicle's servers, through which they were able to obtain limited account information.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED:

Our investigation determined that the account information posted online only contained your name, email address, username(s), and password(s) for your online account(s) to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and/or chroniclevitae.com. Although The Chronicle hashed and salted passwords for online accounts in our database, meaning that a cryptographic process was used to render the actual passwords indecipherable to third parties and that they were not maintained in plain text, the unauthorized parties were able to bypass the cryptographic hashing and salting process, making the passwords for some online accounts accessible in plain text.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:

The Chronicle reset passwords to all online accounts on June 16, 2020, so that the passwords for the accounts are no longer valid. If you have not logged in since that date, the next time you log in to your online account(s), you will be prompted to change your password(s). Also, if you use the same username(s) and password(s) for any other online account, we recommend that you change your password there as well.

WHAT WE ARE DOING:

To date, we have no evidence that there has been any unauthorized access to your online account(s); however, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. In addition to resetting the password(s) to all online accounts using stronger hashing and salting technology, we have taken steps to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, including the replacement of the server with the unauthorized access, as well as additional procedures to further expand and strengthen security processes.

FOR MORE INFORMATION:

We regret any inconvenience or concern this may cause you. If you have any questions, please call 1-833-579-1097, Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time.

Sincerely,

Ken Sands

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE:

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<First and Last Name>>,

We are writing to inform you about a security incident that occurred on the LACBA.org website. On June 11, 2020, we discovered that unauthorized cybercriminals had placed malicious code on our website, which copied member payment card information and other data as it was entered on the site. The cybercriminals then transferred this information to a server they operated. We understand that these cybercriminals targeted many bar associations and professional organizations, not just LACBA.

As soon as we learned of this issue, we took steps to prevent any further theft of our members' personal information and began an internal investigation. We have also retained an independent forensic firm. The following details are based on our current understanding of this incident but may be subject to change.

What happened? On June 11, 2020, a financial institution alerted LACBA that there was malicious code present on specific portions of its website, LACBA.org. Further investigation of the incident established that the malicious code was present at least as early as May 10, 2020.

What information was involved? Our internal investigation indicates that the information compromised as a result of this incident includes your first and last name, 16-digit payment card number(s), username, password, attorney bar number (if used as a username), and any other information you typed into the website at that time.

What we are doing? We have eliminated the code that enabled unauthorized access to the personal information and have engaged an independent forensic firm to review our systems and recommend any additional necessary changes.

What you can do? If you have not already done so, you should change your LACBA.org password and your password for all other online accounts for which you use the same username or email address and password. We recommend that you contact the financial institution that issued the payment card you used on LACBA.org and alert them to the compromise of your payment card information. We also recommend that you review your account statements for any suspicious or unauthorized charges between at least as early as May 10, 2020, and the present, and to contact your financial institution if you identify any such charges. In addition, we recommend that you regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies.

For More Information: If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at 1-833-431-1282.

Sincerely,

Stan Bissey
Executive Director	The organization reported that cybercriminals placed malicious code on their website to copy member payment card information as well as other data, indicating that this was a card-related data breach.

1305 E. Walnut Street
Des Moines, Iowa 50319-0106
consumer@ag.iowa.gov

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We are writing to notify you of two potential data security incidents involving Iowa residents.

In 2016, Morgan Stanley closed two data centers and decommissioned computer equipment that processed client information in both locations. As is customary, we contracted with a vendor to remove the data from the devices. We subsequently learned that certain devices believed to have been wiped of all information still contained some unencrypted data (the Data Center Event).

Separately, in 2019, Morgan Stanley disconnected and replaced certain computer servers (the WAAS device) in local branch offices. Those servers had stored information on encrypted disks that may have included personal information. During a recent inventory, we were unable to locate a small number of those devices. The manufacturer subsequently informed us of a software flaw that could have resulted in small amounts of previously deleted data remaining on the disks in unencrypted form (the WAAS Device Event).

We have worked with outside technical experts to understand the facts and any potential risks. We are not aware of any access to or misuse of personal information in connection with either of these incidents.

For both events, we investigated the disposition and handling of the devices, and worked with outside technical experts to understand any potential risks to customer data in light of the technical characteristics and configuration of each of the relevant devices. In addition, we have continuously monitored active accounts as well as internet and dark web forums for any evidence of misuse of Morgan Stanley data and have not detected any unauthorized activity related to the incident.

Nonetheless, we decided that, in an abundance of caution, on July 10, 2020, we would provide notice of the Data Center Event and the WAAS Device Event to individuals whose information may have been on the devices when they left our possession.

Data that potentially could have remained on the devices may have included account names and numbers (at Morgan Stanley and any linked bank accounts), Social Security numbers, passport numbers, contact information, dates of birth, and asset value and holdings data. Note that any data on the devices did not contain credit or debit card numbers or passwords that could be used to access financial accounts.

We are notifying Iowa residents who may have been affected via a written notice that will be delivered by the U.S. Postal Service or, where electronic communications have been authorized by the customer, via our e-communications system. A sample copy of the notice is attached hereto.

As noted above, we have continuously monitored this situation and have not detected any unauthorized activity relating to this incident. In addition, for any potentially impacted account, we have instituted enhanced security procedures, including continuous fraud monitoring and monitoring of information about malicious online activity and evidence of misuse of any Morgan Stanley data. We have also arranged with Experian to provide any potentially affected individuals with credit monitoring services for 24 months at no charge to them.

Finally, in addition to the measures described above, we have taken steps to further strengthen controls aimed at reducing the risk that such an incident could occur in the future.

To the extent you have any questions about this notification, please contact my colleague, Akinyemi Akiwowo at (212) 537-1592 or Akinyemi.Akiwowo@morganstanley.com for additional information.

Upon identifying the incident, Merani promptly removed the code from its systems and retained a forensic security firm to investigate the incident. Merani has also notified law enforcement. Additionally, we have taken steps to alert the credit card brands of the incident so they can monitor affected customers' credit and debit card accounts for potential fraudulent activity. Finally, we have taken additional technical steps to further secure the restaurant's payment processing system to prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future.

Merani encourages individuals to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft by reviewing credit card, bank, and other financial statements for any unauthorized activity.

Dear Patient,

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened?

On the morning of Monday, June 1, 2020, we discovered that our computer network had been hacked and our computer terminals could not be used.

What Information Was Involved?

The computers stored both dental records and payment information, including Social Security numbers of several patients and insurance information. As a result, your personal information is now potentially accessible to unauthorized individuals.

What We Did

Immediately upon discovery, we contacted a local IT company and another IT company in the State of New York to resolve the issue. We paid ransom to the hacker and IT companies to obtain the data. Everything has been resolved. We will report to the State Attorney General, FBI, and HHS.

What You Can Do

We encourage you to take the following steps to protect yourself from risks associated with this breach of your data:

Dental records and Dental Insurance Information:

Regularly review the explanation of benefits statement that you receive from your insurance administrator. If you see any services listed that you did not receive, contact your administrator immediately at the number on your statement. You should also check your credit receipts for dental bills that you do not recognize. If you find anything suspicious, call the credit reporting agency at the number on the report.

Social Security Number:

Place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit files. A fraud alert requires potential creditors to use what the law refers to as reasonable policies and procedures to verify your identity before issuing credit in your name. The alert will remain on your accounts for 90 days. A security freeze will lock your credit files so nobody can access them to obtain credit in your name. You can unlock them temporarily or permanently at any time. You can request a fraud alert or security freeze through any one of the three reporting agencies. Experian 888.397.3742, Equifax 800.525.6285, and TransUnion 800.680.7289. You can also request a credit report from any of these agencies, which you should check for suspicious activity.

Re: Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear Office of the Attorney General:

This Firm represents the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac'') and we are writing to notify you regarding the nature and circumstances of a recent data security incident involving a ransomware attack suffered by one of Freddie Mac's vendors. The data security incident potentially affects personal information of individual borrowers whose mortgage loans were sold to Freddie Mac.

On May 20, 2020, it came to Freddie Mac's attention that, earlier this year on an unknown date, a vendor Freddie Mac hired to perform services on some of its loans experienced a ransomware attack on systems that contained personal information of individual borrowers. At this time, Freddie Mac has no evidence that the personal information of affected borrowers has in fact been accessed or used inappropriately. Freddie Mac has been in communication with the vendor since learning of the incident. Because the incident left the vendor's system inaccessible to the vendor, the vendor did not immediately know the details of the incident or the information affected. Many details are still uncertain.

After investigation, Freddie Mac has determined that information on the vendor's systems at the time of the ransomware incident included loan application data of individual borrowers including name, address, social security number, date of birth, credit and bank account information. The vendor has informed Freddie Mac that it has not found any evidence that personal information, which was encrypted as required by Freddie Mac's contract with the vendor, was accessed or taken from	The breach was caused by a ransomware attack suffered by one of Freddie Mac's vendors, which affected the personal information of individual borrowers.

As a result, these individuals are being notified of this incident and being provided with credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. Columbia has received information that as a result of the ransomware attack the unauthorized/unknown threat actor was able to access and exfiltrate some student and employee personal information. This information includes their name and Social Security number.

To date, Bousquet Holstein is not aware of any reports of identity fraud or improper use of any information as a direct result of this incident.

Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, Bousquet Holstein wanted to inform you (and the affected resident) of the incident and to explain the steps that it is taking to help safeguard the affected resident against identity fraud.

RE: Important Security Notification - Please read this entire letter.

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by Zeta Tau Alpha (ZTA) that may have involved your personal information described below. At ZTA, we take the privacy and security of all information very seriously. While we have no evidence to suggest that any of the impacted information was viewed or misused during this compromise, it is crucial that we be as supportive and transparent as possible. That is why I am writing to inform you of this incident, to offer information about steps that can be taken to help protect your information, and to let you know about complimentary credit monitoring services that we are offering you through TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.

I sincerely apologize for any concern that this incident may cause you. Let me reassure you that ZTA is fully committed to supporting you.

What Happened:

On May 8, 2020, ZTA became aware of a vulnerability to iMIS, ZTA's management software. Upon discovery, ZTA began the process of updating iMIS to remove the vulnerability. Further, ZTA promptly began investigating the vulnerability. ZTA's investigation identified malicious code that was added to the iMIS software that acted as a credit card skimmer between April 27, 2020, and May 27, 2020. As a result, the malicious code may have allowed an unauthorized individual to collect credit card data from transactions that occurred within this time period. Importantly, the vulnerability, as well as the malicious code, has been removed.

While we have no reason to believe that any information was actually viewed or misused during this compromise, we are providing this notification to you out of an abundance of caution and so that you may diligently monitor your personal information and resources. We take great care in the security of our technology systems and regret that this incident has occurred.

What Information Was Involved:

It is important to note, as mentioned above, that there is no evidence to suggest that any personally identifiable information has been viewed or misused. The personal information that could have been viewed by the unauthorized individual(s) may have included your first and last name, in combination with your name, address, and credit card information utilized in your recent transaction with ZTA.

What We Are Doing:

ZTA has taken every step necessary to address the incident and is committed to fully protecting all of the information that you have entrusted to us. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately began investigating the vulnerability and took steps to secure the iMIS software. Additionally, we are offering you complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services.

Credit Monitoring:

As a safeguard, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for one year provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. Additional information regarding how to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring service is enclosed.

What You Can Do:

In addition to enrolling in the complimentary credit monitoring service detailed within, we recommend that you remain vigilant in regularly reviewing and monitoring all of your account statements and credit history to guard against any unauthorized transactions or activity. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts, please promptly contact your financial institution or company. We have provided additional information below, which contains more information about steps you can take to protect yourself against fraud and identity theft.

For More Information:

Should you have questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact Carrie Hoffeditz, Senior Director of Operations & Personnel at 317-872-0540.

ZTA has no relationship more important or more meaningful than the one we share with you. I want to personally express my deepest regret for any worry or inconvenience that this incident may cause you.

Sincerely,

Meghan Parker
Executive Director

RE: Notice of a Data Breach

Dear [first name] [last name],

Steel Partners values our employees and stakeholders and understands the importance of protecting personal information. We are writing to inform you about an incident that may involve some of your information. This incident may have involved personal information concerning you that was collected by a Steel Partners entity relating to your employment, your status as a beneficiary of a current or former employee, your participation in a pension plan, or your status as a beneficiary of a pension plan participant. Steel Partners entities include Steel Partners, portfolio companies of Steel Partners, and pension plans administered by Steel Partners.

What Happened

Steel Partners recently discovered unauthorized activity in the email account of one of its employees. It immediately initiated an investigation, which identified unauthorized access to that email account. Steel Partners locked the account and promptly engaged a forensic security firm to assist. The investigation identified that the method by which the email account was accessed allowed for a local download of the entire mailbox. On May 29, 2020, it was determined that there were documents within the employee's email account that contained personal information. A broader review of our systems indicated that only one email account was impacted. We are notifying you because some of your personal information was contained in documents within the Steel Partners employee's email account.

What Information Was Involved

The impacted email account contained documents that may have contained your first name, last name, social security number, and date of birth or health information related to disability or workers compensation claims.

What You Can Do

While we have no indication that your personal information has been misused, we encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring	The breach seems to be an unintended disclosure, as the email account of an employee was accessed without authorization, allowing the download of personal information, but no hacking or intentional breach is mentioned.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH - UPDATE

What Happened?

On Sunday, June 28, 2020 Central European Time, we discovered a data breach incident involving malware and related behaviors that involved unauthorized access to our IT systems by an unknown third party. Under our current assessment, the unauthorized access to the files relevant to this notice began on June 21, 2020.

Given the nature of the attack, we do not yet have a complete understanding of the scope of the unauthorized access to our data. We do, however, have reason to believe that such unauthorized access encompassed access to or loss of certain personal data stored on our IT systems.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation is ongoing and includes efforts to identify what personal data was affected. We have reason to believe that the affected personal data includes current or historic communications, contact details, and HR data (such as compensation, Social Security Numbers, and other personal identification details in HR records).

What We Are Doing.

Upon learning of the unauthorized access, we promptly retained the industry-leading cybersecurity firm, Mandiant of FireEye, Inc. (www.fireeye.com), to immediately respond to the threat, defend our systems and conduct remediation. We believe that Mandiant's work has closed all probable access points used and is substantially hardening our systems against the threat. Additional measures will be taken as and when further details become available.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

Dear DOJ: Consumer Protection Bureau,

I am writing on behalf of Collabera, Inc. (Collabera) to inform you of a data incident that may have involved employees' personal information. On June 8, 2020, Collabera identified malware in its network system consistent with a ransomware attack. We promptly restored access to our data from backup files, and the malware has been removed from the system. We immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this event. On June 10, we became aware that the unauthorized party obtained some data from our system. We are working with outside forensic experts and law enforcement to conduct a more detailed review of the incident.

Based on our investigation to date, it appears the unauthorized party was first in Collabera's environment on May 24, 2020. We believe the incident likely involved some employee personal information. The information potentially involved varied, but may have included first and last names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, employee benefits and employee verification information, passport/visa information, and email addresses.

Though we have no reason to believe that employees' personal information has been misused for the purpose of committing fraud or identity theft, we are providing individual notifications and taking protective measures out of an abundance of caution. Collabera cares about protecting the identity of its employees and is therefore offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection for two years. Individual notifications detailing the incident and the enrollment process were mailed to New Hampshire residents on July 10, 2020. Based on our investigation, it appears that 129 residents from New Hampshire may have been impacted.

Remedial steps Collabera has taken in response to this incident	The malware in Collabera's network system was consistent with a ransomware attack, indicating that this was a hacking incident.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We represent the McPherson College (McPherson), headquartered in McPherson, Kansas with respect to a potential data security incident described in more detail below. McPherson takes the security and privacy of their student and employee information very seriously and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

1. Nature of the security incident.

On or about October 3, 2019, McPherson College discovered that a single employee's email account may have been compromised. McPherson immediately took action to secure the email account and conduct an investigation into the incident. McPherson proceeded to engage a third-party computer forensics firm to conduct a thorough investigation. That investigation concluded in or about November 2019 and found that a single employee's email account had been compromised. McPherson then proceeded to engage a third-party e-discovery vendor to review the contents of the compromised email account and create a list of individuals that would need to be notified as a result of unknown/unauthorized threat actor accessing the compromised email account. On June 3, 2020, after a thorough and full search of the material accessible within the email account, McPherson received a final list of the names and addresses of the individuals whose information may have been accessed by the unauthorized/unknown third party. The unknown unauthorized threat actor may have been able to access the affected individuals' name in addition to possibly their Passport number, driver's license number, government id number, credit card number and CVV, student loan information, limited personal health information, and/or date of birth.

2. Number of New Hampshire residents affected.

A total of two (2) New Hampshire residents may have been potentially affected by this incident. Notification letters to these individuals were mailed on July 10, 2020, by first-class mail. A sample copy of the notification letter is included with this letter.

3. Steps taken.

McPherson takes the security and privacy of the information very seriously and has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future, as well as to protect the privacy and security of potentially impacted individuals' information. These include but are not limited to implementing multi-factor authentication, forcing password changes, strengthening the security of their email tenant, and reporting the incident to the appropriate government regulators as required. Additionally, the affected individuals were provided with credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for a period of 1 year through Epiq.

4. Contact information.

McPherson remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information in its control. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@WilsonElser.com or (312) 821-6164.

Very truly yours,

Dear <<Name 1>>,

Ply Gem Industries, Inc. (Ply Gem) understands the importance of protecting the personal information that we receive and maintain. We are writing to inform you that we identified and addressed a data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and steps you can take in response.

We recently concluded an investigation and analysis of a data security incident involving unauthorized access to some employees' email accounts. Upon learning of the incident, we immediately secured the accounts, launched an investigation, and engaged a cybersecurity firm to assist. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized person obtained access to the email accounts at various times between July 26, 2019, and November 18, 2019. The investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized person.

We, therefore, conducted a thorough review of the contents of all email accounts and, on June 25, 2020, determined that an email or an attachment to an email in the accounts contained some of your personal information, including your <<insert variable text>>. To date, we have no evidence of any misuse of your information as a result of this incident, and we assure you that we take this incident very seriously.

As a precaution, we have arranged to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year through Kroll, a global leader in risk mitigation and response. Their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus, listed above. Placing a fraud alert on your credit report is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge. This makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

- Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
- TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
- Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information to place a freeze on your credit reports. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three	Ply Gem Industries experienced an unauthorized access to some of their employees' email accounts between July 26, 2019, and November 18, 2019, and determined on June 25, 2020, that an email or an attachment in the account contained some personal information of customers.

We are writing to inform you that we identified and addressed a data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

We recently concluded an investigation and analysis of a data security incident involving unauthorized access to some employees' email accounts. Upon learning of the incident, we immediately secured the accounts, launched an investigation, and engaged a cybersecurity firm to assist. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized person obtained access to the email accounts at various times between July 26, 2019, and November 18, 2019. The investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized person.

We, therefore, conducted a thorough review of the contents of all email accounts and, on June 25, 2020, determined that an email or an attachment to an email in the accounts contained some of your personal information, including your <<insert variable text>>. To date, we have no evidence of any misuse of your information as a result of this incident, and we assure you that we take this incident very seriously.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 1 year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file.

As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Verigent then worked diligently to identify up-to-date address information in order to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals.

Hello [NAME],

We are writing to inform you that there was a breach of BeerAdvocate user data that occurred between 2012 and 2013. After an investigation by an independent third-party cybersecurity firm, it was confirmed that BeerAdvocate user login credentials (email address, BeerAdvocate forum password) were lost and aggregated along with breaches of other websites into a breach dataset that became known as CouponMom 2014. We are notifying you as your BeerAdvocate forum login credentials may have been affected at that time. It is important to note that BeerAdvocate did not possess or lose any financial information or information that is likely to lead to identity theft.

The exact method of breach could not be determined, due to the incident occurring seven to eight years ago. However, from the number of emails involved and understanding the password hashing scheme in use in that timeframe, it is possible that the BeerAdvocate third-party forum software user database was compromised, and a since-retired password hashing method allowed some passwords to be derived. These credentials appear to have been aggregated along with breaches of other sites into the breach dataset that became known as CouponMom 2014. This notification was not delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

BeerAdvocate user login credentials (email address, BeerAdvocate forum password) were lost and aggregated along with breaches of other websites into a breach dataset that became known as CouponMom 2014.

New management at Next Glass has thoroughly investigated this matter in order to disclose the relevant information needed to provide transparency. In the years since 2013, BeerAdvocate's forum software and its password hashing scheme has been upgraded to salted multiple iteration-SHA-256. Website traffic is encrypted and routed through a reputable internet security provider. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is offered to all users. Since the acquisition of certain BeerAdvocate assets in February 2020, BeerAdvocate's platform has been migrated to a more secure infrastructure. Password resets have been initiated in tandem with email contact to the BeerAdvocate user community. We prioritize user data and safety and have continued to upgrade the platform's infrastructure to ensure best-in-class data protection.

We recommend that you reset any password that is/was similar to the password you used for BeerAdvocate. Please review the enclosed "Additional Resources" section included with this letter. This section describes additional steps you can take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.

If you have any questions, please contact support@beeradvocate.com or call the toll numbers included below.

You should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your home state if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused. You may also contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your home state for information on how to prevent or avoid identity theft.

You can obtain information from the federal trade commission and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes.

Fraud Alert.

You may place a fraud alert by calling one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies above. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit.

Security Freeze.

You have the ability to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you may be able to use an online process, an automated telephone line, or a written request to any of the three credit reporting agencies listed above. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze: (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue.	The breach involved an unauthorized party gaining access to login credentials which allowed them to compromise a third-party forum software user database containing email addresses and passwords. The exact method of attack could not be determined due to the incident occurring over seven years ago.

What Happened?

SRG was the subject of an isolated cyber event called a phishing incident in which unauthorized individual(s) gained access to certain email accounts by masquerading as a reputable and recognized person and gaining user credentials. On December 18, 2019, we discovered the suspicious activity within our email system and immediately blocked the unauthorized individual(s). Our initial investigation determined that there may have been unauthorized access to certain SRG employee email accounts. We immediately forced password resets for all company email addresses. With the aid of third party forensic IT specialists, we then undertook a lengthy and labor-intensive process to review impacted email accounts to identify any personal information that may have been accessible to the unauthorized individual(s). This extensive process included a review of each of the individual emails and attachments within the specific accounts that had been impacted by the intrusion. As a result of those efforts, we are providing you notice that our investigation determined that your information may have been accessible to the unauthorized individual(s) between December 17, 2019 and December 18, 2019.

What Information Was Involved?

Although we have no evidence to suggest that your information was actually used by the unauthorized individual(s), we are sending this letter so you can take steps to protect yourself and your information. Our investigation confirmed that the impacted emails contained the following personal information pertaining to you: name, Impacted Elements.

What We Are Doing.

We take the security of information in our care very seriously. Upon discovery, we immediately forced password resets for all company email addresses and commenced a thorough investigation into the nature and scope of the event. In addition, we implemented multi-factor authentication as an additional security safeguard and launched mandatory companywide training and awareness. We are continuing to take steps to implement additional safeguards and strengthen policies and procedures relating to data privacy and security. We are also notifying regulators, including certain state regulators, and law enforcement of the event as required.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We are writing on behalf of Angel Productions Worldwide, Inc. ("APWI") to notify you of a security incident involving one New Hampshire resident.

APWI recently concluded an investigation into a ransomware incident. Certain files on some of the devices in APWI's network were encrypted by an unauthorized actor on or around May 29, 2020. Upon discovering the incident, APWI immediately took steps to secure the network, launched an internal investigation, and an outside cyber security firm was engaged to assist.

APWI's investigation determined that an unauthorized actor had access to computer systems used to store information about APWI employees. Information stored on the computer systems include employee names, addresses, and Social Security numbers.

On July 17, 2020, APWI began mailing written notifications to potentially affected individuals, including one New Hampshire resident who is being notified of the incident in writing in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 359-C:20 in substantially the same form as the enclosed letter.

APWI is offering the New Hampshire resident a complimentary one-year membership in credit monitoring and identity theft protection services from Experian. APWI has also provided a telephone number for potentially affected individuals to call with any questions they may have.

To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, APWI is providing additional cybersecurity training to its employees and is taking steps to further enhance its existing security measures.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General MacDonald,

We are writing on behalf of our client, Pharmavite LLC ("Pharmavite"), to provide notice of a security incident involving four (4) New Hampshire residents.

On July 6, 2020, Pharmavite learned that an unauthorized actor had accessed an employee's email account at various times between June 12, 2020 and June 15, 2020. As soon as it became aware of suspicious activity, Pharmavite took immediate measures to secure the email account and launched a thorough investigation to determine who was impacted and what information may have been affected.

Based on this investigation, it was determined that some personal information was potentially accessible, including names, addresses, and driver's license and social security numbers. Beginning on July 9, 2020, Pharmavite began mailing notification letters via United States Postal Service First-Class mail to four (4) New Hampshire residents in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 359-C:20. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed.

Pharmavite has provided a telephone number for potentially affected individuals to call with any questions they may have and has offered these individuals a complimentary two-year membership to Experian's IdentityWorks credit monitoring service.

To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, Pharmavite is taking steps to enhance its existing security protocols and is reeducating its staff for awareness on these types of incidents. It has also notified law enforcement of the incident.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

M. Scott Koller

Notification Letter:

Dear [First Name] [Last Name],

At Pharmavite LLC ("Pharmavite"), protecting the security and confidentiality of your personal information is of the utmost importance. Regrettably, we are writing to inform you about an incident involving some of your information. This notice describes the incident, outlines the measures we have taken in response, and offers options for you to further protect your information.

What Happened?

We recently conducted an investigation into suspicious activity originating from unauthorized access to an employee's email account. As soon as we became aware of the suspicious activity, we immediately took measures to secure the email account and launched an internal investigation. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person had accessed an employee's email account at various times from June 12 to June 15, 2020. On July 7, 2020, we concluded our investigation, determining that the email account contained personal information that was potentially accessible.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation was not able to determine whether any specific emails were accessed by the unauthorized person; however, we were not able to rule out that possibility. Out of an abundance of caution, we conducted a thorough review of all emails and attachments that were potentially accessible. We are notifying you because the email account contained a message or attachment with your personal information, including your name, address, and social security number.

What We Are Doing.

To further protect personal information, we are taking steps to enhance our existing security protocols and reeducating our staff for awareness on these types of incidents. We have notified law enforcement of the incident.

What You Can Do.

Even though we have no indication that your information has been misused, we encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements for any unauthorized activity.

RE: NOTICE OF DATA SECURITY INCIDENT

Dear Sir/Madam:

We write on behalf of Quicken Loans, Inc. ("Quicken Loans") to notify you of a data security incident that Quicken Loans recently experienced. Specifically, on or around April 22, 2020, an unauthorized person gained access to email inboxes belonging to a small number of Quicken Loans employees. As a result, the intruder may have viewed certain personal information in Quicken Loans' possession.

Quicken Loans discovered the incident shortly thereafter, and recently completed its review to determine those who are potentially affected. After discovering the incident, Quicken Loans worked to determine the nature and scope of the access and ensure it was contained. The information potentially accessed includes name, bank account number, Social Security number, and address and email address.

Quicken Loans is notifying one (1) New Hampshire borrower of the incident. At this time Quicken Loans does not have any evidence that any individual has suffered from identity theft as a result of the incident. Quicken Loans is taking prompt action to assist the New Hampshire resident who may have been impacted by this event. Quicken Loans is notifying the resident, and recommending actions they can take to protect themselves, such as monitoring account statements, obtaining credit reports, and instituting a security freeze on their credit files. Quicken Loans also will make available 24 months of identity protection services from LifeLock, at no cost to the individual. A template copy of the notice sent to the individual is attached to this letter.

Quicken Loans is undertaking a review of its systems to help guard against a similar incident occurring in the future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

David S. Kantrowitz	The breach was caused by an unauthorized person gaining access to email inboxes belonging to a small number of Quicken Loans employees.

Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>>,

The American Public Works Association (APWA) is writing to notify you of a data security incident relating to your purchase through our online store (www.apwa.net/store/) that may have involved your payment card information. At APWA, we take the privacy and security of your information very seriously. We are writing to both inform you of the incident, and to advise you about certain steps you can take to protect your information.

What happened?

On May 19, 2020, we learned of suspicious activity occurring in our online store. Upon discovering the activity, we took immediate steps to secure our system and member information. We also immediately took steps to investigate the situation. APWA retained and worked with a leading forensics firm to investigate whether any member information had been accessed or acquired without authorization. We recently received a determination from the forensic investigation that certain payment card information may have been exposed as a result of unauthorized activity in the online store.

What information was involved?

The unauthorized access to our online store potentially compromised payment card information belonging to customers who made purchases through our online store between April 10, 2020 and May 20, 2020. The payment card information that may have been compromised included names, card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.

What we are doing.

As soon as we discovered the incident, we took the steps described above. In addition, we immediately reported the matter to the payment card brands to protect your payment card information and prevent fraudulent activity. We have also reported the incident to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and will provide whatever cooperation is necessary to hold the perpetrators accountable. As an added precaution, we are offering, at no cost to you, identity theft protection services through ID Experts. Your MyIDCare services include: 12 months of CyberScan monitoring, a $1 million identity fraud loss reimbursement policy, and fully managed ID theft recovery services. With this protection, MyIDCare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised.

What you can do.

You can follow the recommendations included with this letter to protect your personal information. We recommend that you review your current and past credit and debit card account statements for discrepancies or unusual activity. If you see anything that you do not understand or that looks suspicious, or if you suspect that any fraudulent transactions have taken place, you should call the bank that issued the card immediately. We encourage you to contact ID Experts with any questions and to enroll in the complimentary MyIDCare services by calling 1-800-939-4170 or going to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect and using the Enrollment Code provided above.

We take this matter very seriously. Please accept our sincere apologies for any concern or inconvenience that this incident may cause you.

Sincerely,

Scott D. Grayson, CAE
Chief Executive Officer
American Public Works Association
1200 Main Street, Suite 1400
Kansas City, MO 64105-2100

Recommended Steps to Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. CyberScan will be automatically activated upon enrolling. You may login to your membership to add additional information into CyberScan. If you need assistance, MyIDCare will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact MyIDCare at 1-800-939-4170 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in MyIDCare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the MyIDCare website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review	The data breach involved payment information including card numbers, names, expiration dates, and security codes being exposed for customers who made a purchase through the American Public Works Association's online store between April 10, 2020, and May 20, 2020.

Re: Notification of a Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We represent U.S. Restaurants, Inc. (USRI) in connection with a recent incident that may have impacted the personal information of twelve (12) New Hampshire residents. USRI is reporting the incident pursuant to N.H. REV. STAT. ANN. 359-C:20. This notice will be supplemented, if necessary, with any new significant facts discovered subsequent to its submission. While USRI is notifying you of this incident, USRI does not waive any rights or defenses relating to the incident or this notice, or the applicability of New Hampshire on personal jurisdiction.

NATURE OF THE SECURITY BREACH OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR ACCESS

USRI has learned that, on February 7, 2020, an unauthorized third party accessed a number of USRI's computer systems without authorization and infected those systems with ransomware. Upon learning of the situation, USRI promptly launched an internal investigation and secured its computer systems to prevent potential further access. USRI also retained a leading forensic security firm to investigate the incident and confirm the security of its computer systems.

After identifying the scope of the incident, USRI worked with a document review vendor to conduct a programmatic review of the contents of the impacted accounts, and then manually review the items identified as potentially at risk by that programmatic review. Due to the scope of the incident and the amount of data involved, this process took a considerable amount of time. On June 15, 2020, USRI determined the identity of the impacted individuals and worked to identify addresses for those individuals and update the addresses based on the National Change of Address database. This research resulted in USRI determining that the impacted systems contained the personal information of twelve (12) New Hampshire residents. The impacted information included individuals' names and Social Security numbers.

At this point, USRI is not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a result of this incident, and cannot confirm if any personal information was actually obtained by an unauthorized person. Nevertheless, because certain computer systems were accessed by the unauthorized third party, and USRI cannot determine exactly what, if any, information may have been obtained, USRI is notifying individuals whose personal information could have been accessed.

NUMBER OF NEW HAMPSHIRE RESIDENTS AFFECTED

USRI has identified twelve (12) New Hampshire residents whose information may have been accessed by the unauthorized third party.	An unauthorized third party accessed the organization's computer systems without authorization and infected those systems with ransomware. The organization promptly launched an internal investigation and secured its computer systems to prevent potential further access. A forensic security firm was also retained to investigate the incident and confirm the security of its computer systems. Due to the scope of the incident and the amount of data involved, it took a considerable amount of time to review the contents of the impacted accounts. The impacted information included individuals' names and Social Security numbers, and US Restaurants Inc is notifying individuals whose personal information could have been accessed.

RE: Notice of Data Breach

This letter provides you with information on the steps Collabera has taken to further guard against the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of your personal data and the resources we are making available to you, as well as guidance on additional steps you may wish to take.

The information potentially involved varied, but may have included first and last names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, employee benefits and employee verification information, passport/visa information, and email addresses.

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely.

You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft.

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to inform you of a recent data security incident suffered by Zeta Tau Alpha ("ZTA"). On May 8, 2020, ZTA became aware of a vulnerability to iMIS, ZTA's management software. Upon discovery, ZTA began the process of updating iMIS to remove the vulnerability. Further, ZTA promptly began investigating the vulnerability. ZTA's investigation identified malicious code that was added to the iMIS software that acted as a credit card skimmer between April 27, 2020, and May 27, 2020. As a result, the malicious code may have allowed an unauthorized individual to collect credit card data from transactions that occurred within this time period. Importantly, the vulnerability, as well as the malicious code, has been removed.

ZTA has identified one (1) New Hampshire resident potentially impacted as a result of this incident. ZTA will be promptly notifying the affected individuals on July 16, 2020, and is providing them with complimentary credit monitoring for one (1) year. A copy of the drafted letter is attached. As the letter indicates, ZTA will be offering credit monitoring and identity restoration services at ZTA's expense. ZTA is taking steps to comply with all applicable notification obligations.

Please contact me should you have any questions.

Regrettably, we are writing to inform you that we recently identified and addressed a security incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, outlines the measures we have taken in response, and steps you can take.

What Happened?

Our ongoing investigation into a phishing email incident recently determined that an unauthorized individual gained access to a Dynavax employee's email account for a brief period of time on February 28, 2020. Upon identifying the incident, we immediately secured the account, and a leading computer forensic firm was engaged to assist with our investigation. A review of available data shows no further unauthorized access to the account occurred. While we have identified employee information in the email account, our investigation has not shown that the unauthorized person stole or misused or attempted to misuse any personal information from the account.

What Information Was Involved?

Out of an abundance of caution, we manually reviewed the emails and attachments contained in the employee's email account to identify personal information that may have been accessible to the unauthorized person. As a result of that review, we identified emails and/or attachments that may have included your Extra 1.

What We Are Doing.

Again, there is no evidence that any of your information was actually viewed by the unauthorized person, or that it has been misused. However, we wanted to notify you of this incident and assure you we take this very seriously.

Engagement Number: DB21249

Dear First Name Last Name:

We recently learned of a potential compromise of certain information about you located at a Walgreens store. We are contacting you to provide you with information about the incident and also with information about steps you can take to protect yourself.

WHAT HAPPENED

Sometime between May 26 and June 5, 2020, various groups of individuals broke into multiple Walgreens stores and forced entry into the secured pharmacy at select locations, including your preferred Walgreens. Among the many items stolen were certain items containing health-related information such as filled prescriptions waiting for customer pick up and paper records. This included a very limited number of hard drives that were attached to stolen cash registers. These hard drives contained information about certain recent pharmacy purchases completed at that cash register. One pharmacy automation device that stored prescription labeling information for a short time period was also involved.

Between May 26 and June 5, Walgreens discovered customer information was impacted. We later determined that one or more of the items described above may have contained your information. We wanted to alert you to this fact.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED

We would like to assure you that our investigation has determined that your credit/debit card number, banking information, and Social Security Number were NOT compromised. The information of yours that may have been involved included one or more of the following data elements (where applicable):

- First and last name
- Address
- Phone number
- Date of birth and/or age
- Clinical information such as medication name, strength, quantity, and description
- Prescription number
- Prescriber name
- Health plan name and group number
- Vaccination information including eligibility information
- Email Address
- Balance Rewards Number
- Photo ID Number - Drivers License, state ID, military ID, or passport (e.g. for purchases such as pseudoephedrine)

WHAT WE ARE DOING

Notice of Data Breach

Please read this entire letter.

Dear <<Individual Mailing Name>>,

We hope that you, your family, and loved ones are doing as well as possible during these challenging times. As you likely know, cybersecurity-related incidents are on the rise and, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to notify you that an unauthorized person recently accessed a limited number of Wealth Enhancement Group individual employees' email accounts. Following our investigation, we have concluded that your specific nonpublic personal information may have been accessed by an unauthorized person as a result of this incident. We recognize the concern this may cause, and we want to inform you of the steps we have taken and provide you with information on steps you can take to further protect your personal information.

WHAT HAPPENED?

During our preliminary investigation, we learned that on March 22, 2020, an unauthorized person gained access to a limited number of employees' email accounts through a process called phishing. Phishing occurs when a third-party bad actor is disguised to appear as though it is a known source requesting authorized access to user or email account information, such as a password. Because we have proactively invested in sophisticated cybersecurity technology and training, we were promptly alerted of the threat and took immediate action to secure the impacted email accounts. On June 11, 2020, we concluded our investigation and confirmed that you may have had nonpublic personal information affected by this incident.

WHAT ARE WE DOING?

After becoming aware of this incident, we took prompt action to secure the limited number of employees' individual email accounts to help ensure that the unauthorized person no longer had access. We also took additional steps to contain the situation, including engaging outside information security and technology experts to assist in our review and investigation of the incident. As part of this investigation, our information security and technology experts were engaged to determine what, if any, information may have been able to be accessed.

Because we want you to have maximum peace of mind, we are offering a complimentary 24-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection package through Experian IdentityWorksSM. To activate your membership and start monitoring your personal information, please follow the steps found in Attachment 1 to this letter.

In addition to our existing security measures, we have reviewed and implemented additional options to enhance our technology and security practices to reduce the risk of a similar issue occurring in the future.

WHAT INFORMATION MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED?

The information that the unauthorized person may have been able to access may have included full name, address phone number, email address, social security number, driver's license number or state identification number, or financial account numbers.

WHAT YOU CAN DO.

In addition to using the credit monitoring and identity theft protection described in Attachment 1 of this letter, we recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports to detect errors resulting from the security incident. Promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to your financial institutions or company with which the account is maintained, as well as applicable authorities, including local law enforcement, your state attorney general, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Individuals also have the right to obtain a police report in the event one has been created for this incident. Additionally, to minimize the risk of tax return fraud, the FTC and the IRS both generally recommend that individuals file their income taxes for each year as early as possible.

Please note that we will not email or call you regarding this incident to ask for your personal information. We suggest that you remain cautious when opening emails, clicking on links, responding to requests for entering network credentials, or giving personal information over the phone to anyone claiming to be from Wealth Enhancement Group.

FOR MORE INFORMATION.

We are strongly committed to protecting your personal information, and we apologize for any concern this situation has caused. For further information and assistance, please contact <<Advisor_Name>>, a member of the financial advisory team at Wealth Enhancement Group.

Sincerely,

Jeff Dekko

On June 30, 2020, we received confirmation that an unauthorized individual had gained access to our document management system between April 28, 2020, and June 16, 2020. A review of the documents potentially accessed from within the document management system by the unauthorized individual revealed that some of your personal information may have been impacted.

What Information Was Involved?

Your blum partner can provide information about which specific data elements pertaining to you may have been impacted.

We will continue to provide whatever cooperation is necessary to hold the perpetrator(s) of this incident accountable. We have also implemented multi-factor authentication on our document management system in an effort to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

Re: Notice of Security Incident

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Ply Gem Residential Solutions ("Ply Gem"), to provide notice of a security incident involving eight New Hampshire residents.

Ply Gem recently concluded its investigation of a data security incident that involved unauthorized access to certain employee's email accounts. Upon learning of this, Ply Gem immediately secured the email accounts, launched an investigation, and engaged a cybersecurity firm to assist. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person accessed the email accounts at various times between July 26, 2019 and November 18, 2019. The investigation was not able to determine which emails and attachments, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized person.

Therefore, Ply Gem conducted a comprehensive review of the contents of the email accounts and, on June 25, 2020, determined that an email or an attachment to an email in the accounts contained the names, Social Security numbers, drivers' license numbers, financial account information, and/or payment card information of eight New Hampshire residents.

On July 24, 2020, Ply Gem will begin mailing notification letters to the New Hampshire residents in substantially the same form as the enclosed letter via U.S. First-Class mail in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:20(c). Ply Gem is offering eligible individuals a complimentary, one-year membership to credit monitoring and identity protection services. Ply Gem has also established a dedicated, toll-free call center where individuals may obtain more information regarding the incident.

To help prevent this type of incident from happening in the future, Ply Gem is implementing enhanced security measures and providing additional training to employees.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

Re: Blackbaud data breach

Dear Consumer Protection Bureau,

As per my conversation with Peter in your office this morning, I am writing to report a data security incident at a third-party service provider that involved some personal information of people in our database. Blackbaud, a cloud computing service provider used by Star Island Corporation and numerous other organizations worldwide, alerted us on July 16 about the incident. On July 23, we emailed everybody in our database about this incident. Of the people in our database, 7,268 are from New Hampshire.

Blackbaud has informed us that the data fields with credit card numbers, bank account information, and social security numbers were not part of the ransomware attack, which was conducted by a cybercriminal who gained access to their system on February 7, 2020, and may have gained access to data through May 20, 2020. Blackbaud informs us that they paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed, and they have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at (603) 817-0176 or by email at jwatts@starisland.org.

RE: Lincoln National Life Insurance Company
Referring to as LNL

Pursuant to NH Rev. Stat. 359-C:20, I am writing to notify you of an incident that may have caused the personal information of one New Hampshire resident to be subject to unauthorized access. Lincoln Financial Securities recently discovered that the email accounts of one of its independent financial advisors had been accessed by an unauthorized person from May 1, 2020, to May 3, 2020. We determined on Thursday, July 2, that the personal information of the New Hampshire resident, such as name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, bank account information, driver's license number, medical information, and/or financial account information, may have been exposed due to this unauthorized access.

When Lincoln learned of the access to the email account of the independent advisor, Lincoln quickly took action to assist the advisor in securing their account. Lincoln provided an alert to all advisors regarding a phishing email that had been directed at advisors, required all advisors to do a password reset for their email accounts, and worked with the third-party service provider that managed the email accounts of the independent advisors to determine the nature of the access to the accounts and make configuration changes to the email accounts.

Attached is a draft notification which will be mailed to New Hampshire residents on or around July 24, 2020, and will include an offer of complimentary credit monitoring services for one year. The letter will also be mailed with a copy of the additional resources insert.

We continue to work diligently to minimize the impact of this incident and enhance our cybersecurity posture, as appropriate. I trust that this notice will provide you with all of the information required to assess this matter. Please let me know if you have any additional questions, or if I may be of further assistance.

Re: Legal Notice of Information Security Incident

Dear Sirs or Madams:

We write on behalf of our client, Pivot Technology Services Corp. ("Pivot"), to notify you of a security incident which resulted in the unauthorized access and exfiltration of the personal information of 1 New Hampshire resident.

On June 12, 2020, Pivot discovered that it was the victim of a cybersecurity attack by an unauthorized third party by which the malicious actor deployed ransomware in an attempt to encrypt Pivot's technology infrastructure. Upon detection of the attack, Pivot engaged an industry-leading cyber forensic firm, CrowdStrike, to conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine how the security incident occurred, the scope of such incident, and to assist it with remediation efforts.

With the assistance of the forensic firm, Pivot immediately implemented countermeasures to minimize the encryption of its systems. As a result, some Pivot employees experienced complications with email, however, there were no interruptions to its business operations.

On July 1, 2020, Pivot discovered that the unauthorized third party had in fact gained access to and exfiltrated the personal information of Pivot's employees residing in the United States and immediately undertook an additional investigation to determine the scope of the information affected.

On July 7, 2020, Pivot determined that the following personal information of employees was compromised in the incident: names, addresses, payroll earnings, deductions, 401k, benefits, bank routing and account numbers, bank account names, and social security numbers. From the investigation, we have determined that the unauthorized third party had access to Pivot's systems between June 9, 2020, and June 12, 2020.

In response to the incident, Pivot expedited the implementation process for Multifactor Authentication (MFA) for all applications that are accessed remotely. In addition, Pivot will implement additional safeguards in accordance with the recommendations of the forensic firm, including CrowdStrike Falcon, Mimecast URL filtering process, and Cisco Umbrella, a secure gateway to protect users access.

Pivot has also conducted a thorough review of the potentially affected records and continues to review existing policies and procedures designed to try to prevent a similar occurrence from happening again. In addition, to help protect the identity of impacted individuals, we are offering a complimentary 2-year membership of Equifax ID Patrol. This product provides superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft. All potentially affected individuals will be notified of the incident on July 24, 2020. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed.

If you have any questions or need further information regarding this incident, please contact me (514) 971 2497 or julie.himo@nortonrosefulbright.com.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

We are writing to inform you of a security incident at Pivot Technology Solutions, Inc. concerning information held by itself, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates (current and former) including: Pivot Technology Solutions, Ltd., Pivot Technology Services Corp. formally known as New Prosys Corp. and as successor by merger to Sigma Technologies Solutions, Inc. and ACS(US), Inc., TeraMach Technologies	Pivot discovered that it was the victim of a cybersecurity attack by an unauthorized third party by which the malicious actor deployed ransomware in an attempt to encrypt Pivot's technology infrastructure.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Security Incident

Note: Only a subset of BrainGenie users were impacted by this security incident.

What happened?

In early June, we received a report mentioning BrainGenie as one of the websites potentially impacted by a security incident. We immediately launched an investigation with the help of forensic experts and law enforcement to determine if any user information was affected.

The investigation revealed that our systems were accessed without authorization starting in late February. On July 15, we discovered that unauthorized actors obtained a small amount of personal information from a BrainGenie test (QA) database. We have been assessing the personal information impacted and identifying affected individuals since then.

What information was involved?

Based on reports and our investigation, we believe that the personal information that may have been affected includes user login credentials for BrainGenie accounts, which for some users includes a username and/or email address and password. Although we encrypt our users' passwords, we believe that unauthorized actors may have been able to derive text passwords for some accounts.

What are we doing?

After learning of this incident, we reviewed our security protocols and took additional steps to enhance our security. We have been in communication with law enforcement and are continuing to cooperate with their wider investigation.

What you can do?

We recommend that you change your password for your BrainGenie account. The next time you log in to BrainGenie, you will be prompted to change your password. Please choose a strong password that is not easy to guess and is not one that you use for any other online account.

We also recommend that you change your password for any other online accounts for which you use the same username and password or email address and password combination. Please contact us if you notice any suspicious activity in your BrainGenie account.

More information

If you have any questions about this incident or resetting your BrainGenie password, you may contact us at support@braingenie.com or +1 (650) 272-0606.

Although we do not collect or maintain your financial information, we are required by law to notify you of the following: We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports. If you believe you are a victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and/or the Office of the Attorney General (AGO) in your state. You may also report any suspected identity theft to law enforcement.

Concord, NH 03301

Dear Sir or Madam:

McDonald Hopkins PLC represents the Integrative Nutrition, LLC d/b/a Institute for Integrative Nutrition ("IIN"). I am writing to provide notification of an incident at IIN that may affect the security of personal information of approximately ninety-five (95) New Hampshire residents. IIN's investigation is ongoing, and this notification will be supplemented with any new or significant facts or findings subsequent to this submission, if any. By providing this notice, IIN does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law or personal jurisdiction.

IIN learned recently that an IIN employee was the victim of a phishing attack which resulted in an unauthorized party temporarily obtaining access to one IIN employee email account between March 3, 2020, and March 4, 2020. Upon learning of this issue, IIN immediately secured this account and launched an investigation in consultation with outside cybersecurity professionals who regularly investigate and analyze these types of situations to analyze the extent of any compromise of the email account and the security of the emails and attachments contained within them.

IIN devoted considerable time and effort to determine what information was contained in the affected email accounts. Based on its comprehensive investigation and document review, IIN discovered on June 22, 2020, that the compromised email account contained a limited amount of personal information. The information included the affected residents' full names and one (1) or more of the following: Social Security numbers and/or financial account information. Not all of the affected residents had their Social Security numbers impacted by this incident. IIN has no indication that any information has been misused.

Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, IIN wanted to inform you (and the affected residents) of the incident and to explain the steps that it is taking to help safeguard the impacted residents against identity fraud. IIN is providing the affected residents with written notification of this incident commencing on or about July 22, 2020, in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto. IIN is providing residents with Social Security numbers included in the account with 12 months of credit monitoring and is advising the affected residents to always remain vigilant in reviewing financial account statements for fraudulent or irregular activity on a regular basis. IIN is advising the affected residents about the process for placing a fraud alert and/or security freeze on their credit files and obtaining free credit-reports. The affected residents whose financial account information and/or credit or debit card information was impacted are being advised to contact their financial institutions to inquire about steps to take to protect their accounts. The affected residents are also being provided with the contact information for the consumer reporting agencies and the Federal Trade Commission.

At IIN, protecting the privacy of personal information is a top priority. IIN is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information in its possession and has taken many precautions to safeguard it. IIN continually evaluates and modifies its practices and internal controls to enhance the security and privacy of personal information.

Should you have any questions concerning this notification, please contact me at (248) 220-1360 or cczuprynski@mcdonaldhopkins.com.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Dear <<Name 1>>,

Front Rush, LLC (Front Rush) is writing to inform you about an incident that may have affected the privacy of some of your personal information. Front Rush provides athletics management software solutions to academic institutions and amateur athletics organizations (institutions). One or several of these institutions recruited you as a student athlete, or you may have been a member of one or more institutions, and some of your information was stored within Front Rush's systems due to the institutions' use of Front Rush.

On or around January 5, 2020, Front Rush was informed by a security researcher that one of its Amazon Web Services S3 buckets (the S3 bucket) was publicly accessible from the internet. The S3 bucket contained certain attachments (like transcripts, injury reports, or athletic reports) that were placed in the platform by the institutions, and certain attachments that were uploaded by student-athletes, prospective student-athletes, or their parents/guardians, in response to prompts in a recruitment questionnaire formulated and disseminated by the institutions.

Upon learning of this event, Front Rush immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the incident. The investigation determined that the S3 bucket was publicly accessible between January 18, 2016, and January 8, 2020. Front Rush's own internal database and systems were not affected by this incident. We also contacted the security researcher, who stated that he did not save or share any copies of the data. Although we have no evidence to suggest that the S3 bucket was accessed by anyone other than the security researcher, logs were not sufficient to show whether anyone else had accessed the data.

Out of an abundance of caution, we undertook a comprehensive programmatic and manual review of the entire contents of the S3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the S3 bucket and the individuals to whom it related. We received results of the data mining investigation on May 19, 2020, and began parsing the data to notify impacted institutions. The institutions were notified that your information was confirmed to be impacted on June 15, 2020.

Although we do not have any evidence demonstrating that your information was accessed or acquired, our investigation determined the information present in the S3 bucket included your name and the following types of personal information: <<Breached Elements>>.

Front Rush takes this incident and the security of your personal information seriously. Upon learning of this incident, Front Rush immediately took steps to reconfigure and secure the S3 bucket to ensure it was no longer publicly accessible, and launched an in-depth investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. Front Rush also notified its customer institutions and updated them as the investigation unfolded. As part of Front Rush's ongoing commitment to the privacy of personal information in its care, Front Rush also reviewed its existing policies and procedures to ensure the security of information in its systems. Front Rush will continue working to further secure the information in its systems going forward. Front Rush is also notifying state regulatory authorities, where required.

As an added precaution, Front Rush is also offering you complimentary access to <<CM Length>> months of identity monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration services through TransUnion. If you wish to activate these services, you may follow the instructions included in the Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by Windes, Inc. (Windes) that may have involved your personal information described below. Windes is a recognized leader in the field of accounting, assurance, tax, and business consulting services. You may be receiving this letter because of a relationship you have with Windes or one of Windes partner organizations.

Windes takes the privacy and security of all information very seriously. While we have no evidence to suggest that any of the impacted information was viewed or misused during this compromise, it is crucial that we be as supportive and transparent as possible. That is why I am writing to inform you of this incident, to offer information about steps that can be taken to help protect your information, and to let you know about complimentary credit monitoring services that we are offering you through TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. I sincerely apologize for any concern that this incident may cause you. Let me reassure you that Windes is fully committed to providing the best services possible to you.

What Happened:

On or around March 19, 2020, Windes learned of a potential compromise to one (1) of its employee email accounts. Windes swiftly secured the suspected account and engaged a third-party forensics company to investigate. Following progress by experts in their thorough investigation, it was ultimately determined on May 4, 2020 that two (2) employee email accounts experienced unauthorized access between March 16-19, 2020 and on March 25, 2020. Upon confirmation of the unauthorized access to the Windes employee email accounts, Windes third-party forensic experts immediately investigated whether the affected email accounts contained individuals sensitive information. On June 15, 2020, Windes learned that the unauthorized access may have enabled access to your personal information.

While we have no reason to believe that any information within the affected email accounts was actually viewed, collected or misused during this compromise, we are providing this notification to you out of an abundance of caution and so that you may diligently monitor your personal information and resources. We take great care in the security of our technology systems, and regret that this incident has occurred.

What Information Was Involved:

It is important to note, as mentioned above, that there is no evidence to suggest that any personally identifiable information has been viewed or misused. The personal information that could have been viewed by the unauthorized individual(s) may have included your first and last name, in combination with one or more of the following data elements: date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, financial account number, credit card information, tax identification number, passport number, digital signature, username and password combination, diagnosis information, medical treatment information, prescription information, medical record number, medical history and/or health insurance member/group number. Importantly, the information potentially impacted as it relates to you may be limited to only one of the above-listed types of information.

What We Are Doing:

Windes has taken every step necessary to address the incident and is committed to fully protecting all of the information that you have entrusted to us. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately secured the affected accounts and took steps to enhance the security of all information to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

OTR Leasing understands the importance of protecting our customers' information. Regrettably, we are writing to inform you of an incident that involves some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?
We recently learned that an unauthorized person gained access to a limited number of employee email accounts with personal information between January 14, 2020, and January 20, 2020. We immediately secured the accounts, and a leading cybersecurity firm was hired to assist with the investigation.

What Information Was Involved?
The investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized person actually viewed any emails or attachments in the accounts. In an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments in the accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized person, and on June 8, 2020, we determined that an email or attachment contained your <<b2b_text_1 (Impacted Data)>>.

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE
We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:
Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit. How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR IDENTITY MONITORING SERVICES
You have been provided with access to the following services from Kroll:

Single Bureau Credit Monitoring
You will receive alerts when there are changes to your credit data—for instance, when a new line of credit is applied for in your name. If you do not recognize the activity, you will have the option to call a Kroll fraud specialist, who will be able to help you determine if it is an indicator of identity theft.

Fraud Consultation
You have unlimited access to consultation with a Kroll fraud specialist. Support includes showing you the most effective ways to protect your identity, explaining your rights and protections under the law, assistance with fraud alerts, and interpreting how personal information is accessed and used, including investigating suspicious activity that could be tied to an identity theft event.

Identity Theft Restoration
If you become a victim of identity theft, an experienced Kroll licensed investigator will work on your behalf to resolve related issues. You will have access to a dedicated investigator who understands your issues and can do most of the work for you. Your investigator will be able to dig deep to uncover the scope of the identity theft and then work to resolve it.

Kroll's activation website is only compatible with the current version or one version earlier of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. To receive credit services, you must be over the age of 18 and have established credit in the U.S., have a Social Security number in your name, and have a U.S. residential address associated with your credit file.	An unauthorized person gained access to a limited number of employee email accounts with personal information through hacking between January 14, 2020, and January 20, 2020.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Front Rush, LLC (Front Rush), located at 1333 N. Kingsbury Street, FL 4, Chicago IL, 60642. Front Rush maintains data on behalf of certain data owners and is writing to notify your office, on its own behalf and their behalf, of an incident that may affect the privacy of personal information relating to seven hundred and thirty-five (735) Iowa residents. Front Rush reserves the right to supplement this notice with new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Front Rush does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

Front Rush provides athletics management software solutions to academic institutions and amateur athletics organizations (institutions). On January 5, 2020, Front Rush was informed by a security researcher that one of its Amazon Web Services S3 buckets (the S3 bucket) was publicly accessible from the internet. The S3 bucket contained: (a) certain attachments (like transcripts, injury reports, or athletic reports) that were placed in the platform by the institutions; and (b) certain attachments that were uploaded by student-athletes, prospective student-athletes or their parents/guardians, in response to prompts in a recruitment questionnaire formulated and disseminated by the institutions.

Upon learning of this event, Front Rush immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the incident. The investigation determined that the S3 bucket was likely publicly accessible between January 18, 2016 and January 8, 2020. The investigation also determined that Front Rush's own internal database and systems were unaffected by this incident. Front Rush also contacted the security researcher, who stated that he did not save or share any copies of the data. Although Front Rush has no evidence to suggest that the S3 bucket was accessed by anyone other than the security researcher, logs were not sufficient to show whether anyone else had accessed the data. Out of an abundance of caution, Front Rush undertook a comprehensive programmatic and manual review of the entire contents of the S3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the S3 bucket and the individuals to whom it related.

On January 10, 2020, Front Rush began notifying affected institutions that information relating to individuals may have been affected by this incident, based on information it had available at that time. Once Front Rush completed the comprehensive review of the entire contents of the S3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the bucket and the individuals to whom it related, Front Rush notified the affected institutions, offered to provide notification services, and worked with institutions to confirm the contact information for these individuals. These notifications were sent to the institutions on June 15, 2020.

Front Rush offered the institutions the opportunity to opt out of notices and to provide supplemental or additional address information. The investigation determined that the following types of information related to Iowa residents was accessible within the S3 bucket: Social Security number and other identification number. To date, the investigation has found no evidence of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this event.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On or around July 27, 2020, Front Rush began providing written notice of this incident to potentially affected individuals. This includes approximately seven hundred and thirty-five (735) Iowa residents whose personal information under Iowa law may have been accessible. Written notice to the individuals is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon learning of this event Front Rush immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the incident, as well as what data may potentially be affected. Front Rush provided notice to data owner institutions that had associated-individuals data potentially accessible through the publicly accessible S3 bucket. Front Rush is also offering complimentary access to twelve (12) months of credit and identity monitoring services, including identity restoration services, through TransUnion or Equifax for individuals whose Social Security number or driver's license was potentially exposed, and the contact information for a dedicated call center for potentially affected individuals to contact with questions or concerns regarding this incident.

Additionally, Front Rush is providing affected individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud. This guidance includes information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant about incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, the respective state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

I am writing to notify you of a data security incident on behalf of my client, OTR Leasing, LLC. OTR Leasing is a buyer of late model used tractors, which they then lease and/or sell to owner-operators.

OTR Leasing recently concluded its investigation of a data security incident that involved unauthorized access to a limited number of employee email accounts. Upon suspecting potential unauthorized access to the employees' email accounts, OTR Leasing immediately secured the email accounts and launched an investigation, with the assistance of an outside cybersecurity firm.

As part of the investigation, OTR Leasing conducted a comprehensive review of the emails and attachments in the email accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been involved in this incident. Through the investigation, OTR Leasing determined that an unauthorized party accessed the employees' email accounts between the dates of January 14, 2020, and January 20, 2020. The investigation was unable to rule out the possibility that the unauthorized party may have been able to access emails and attachments in the accounts.

In an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments in the accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized person and on June 8, 2020, determined the name and one or more of: Social Security number and driver's license number of 28 New Hampshire residents were contained in the emails and attachments in the account.

On July 28, 2020, OTR Leasing will mail notification letters via United States Postal Service FirstClass mail to the New Hampshire residents whose information may have been involved in this incident, in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 359-C:20. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed.

OTR Leasing is offering one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection service through Kroll to the individuals whose Social Security number was in the accessed accounts. OTR Leasing has also established a dedicated call center where all individuals may obtain more information regarding the incident.

To help prevent something like this from happening again, OTR Leasing has reset all employee passwords, limited external email access, continued to educate users on how to identify and avoid malicious emails, and added additional authentication measures for remote email access.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

Benjamin D. Wanger
Counsel

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Emanate Health (formerly Citrus Valley Health Partners) values the relationship we have with our current and former employees and understands the importance of protecting personal information. We are writing to inform you about a data breach involving one of our third-party vendors, PaperlessPay Corporation (PaperlessPay), that involves your personal information. PaperlessPay is a payroll processing company that we have contracted with to process and deliver electronic pay stubs and W-2 tax forms. This notice explains the incident, the measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

We received notice from PaperlessPay on March 20, 2020, informing us that an unauthorized person gained access to its computer server. PaperlessPay learned of the incident on February 19, 2020, when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contacted PaperlessPay to inform them that an unknown person was purporting to sell access to the PaperlessPay database on the dark Web. In response, PaperlessPay shut down its web server and Structured Query Language (SQL) server to prevent any potential unauthorized access. The server shutdown prevented you from accessing payroll records online for a period of time while the servers were offline.

Over the following weeks, PaperlessPay cooperated with a joint investigation conducted by DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and PaperlessPay retained a cybersecurity firm to help with its internal forensic investigation of the incident. The investigations confirmed that an unknown individual accessed PaperlessPay's SQL server where employee data is stored on February 18, 2020. The available evidence has not, however, allowed DHS, the FBI, or PaperlessPay's cybersecurity firm to determine what data the individual may have accessed or viewed while connected to the SQL server. It is possible the person only used the access to determine the size of the SQL database and to stage it for subsequent access that could be sold to others, and that the individual did not directly access any employee data. However, the individual would have had the capability to run queries against the SQL database and view its data, so PaperlessPay cannot rule out the possibility of unauthorized access or acquisition of your personal information.

What Information Was Involved?

The information stored in the SQL server about employees consists of the data components that appear on their pay stubs and tax forms, including their name, address, pay and withholdings, last four digits of bank account number (if that information is included on the pay stubs), and Social Security number. These data components are stored on the SQL server in different tables that are associated by user ID numbers, not names, within each table. Therefore, the only way to associate any data with an individual would be to run a query against the database and have it aggregate an individual's name with his or her other data components. PaperlessPay could not conclusively determine whether such queries were run. No bank account passwords or access codes were stored on the SQL server.

What Is PaperlessPay Doing?

PaperlessPay has indicated that it has acted to secure its network and prevent future incidents. In order to resume its services, PaperlessPay has rebuilt an entirely new domain controller, a new web server, and a new SQL server. PaperlessPay has also indicated that it then restored database files to the new SQL server from backups, assigned new IP addresses to all of the new servers, changed all passwords for users and administrators, implemented a setting that requires clients to change their passwords when they log in for the first time, and disabled all remote access capabilities to the new web server and SQL server. PaperlessPay further reported that it installed an endpoint detection and response application on the new servers and other endpoints within its network that has enabled PaperlessPay to monitor all activity while PaperlessPay completed its investigation of the incident.

For Emanate Health's part, we have been working with PaperlessPay to obtain details of the incident and the affected accounts and to obtain assurances that information about our employees is safe. In order to provide you with information you can use to better protect against identity theft and fraud, Emanate Health is offering free credit monitoring services for 12 months. Instructions for enrolling in the credit monitoring services, as well as additional information on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, are included in the attached Privacy Safeguards and last page of this letter.

At Salinas Valley Memorial Healthcare System (SVMHS), we understand that the confidentiality and security of your personal information is critically important, and we are committed to protecting it. This letter is to notify you of a recent cyber incident that affected SVMHS and may have resulted in a compromise of certain electronic files containing your personal information.

What Happened

On April 30, 2020, SVMHS determined that the email account of one of its employees had been compromised. On May 7, 2020, and June 5, 2020, respectively, SVMHS subsequently determined that email accounts of a contractor and three other employees were also compromised. These five email accounts were compromised through Outlook Web Access, SVMHS's browser-based email access solution. Based on our review of the emails within the compromised inboxes, we determined that an email containing your personal information was present in one of the inboxes. Our investigation to date has suggested, however, that the unauthorized person(s) only had access to the inboxes for a matter of hours before we disabled access to the accounts. We also have no evidence at this time to suggest that the unauthorized person(s) viewed, retrieved, or copied your personal information.

What Information Was Involved

The personal information about you in the email in the affected inbox may have included identifying information, such as your name, hospital account number or medical record number, in combination with health information about you, such as your service location and your attending physician's information. The personal information about you in the email did not include your social security, driver's license, or bank account numbers.

What We Are Doing

SVMHS disabled access and then reset the passwords to the affected email accounts. Further, we implemented additional security measures such as two-factor authentication to Outlook Web Access for all SVMHS email accounts. We have also taken other steps to try to prevent	The cyber incident that affected SVMHS and compromised five email accounts was the result of hacking through Outlook Web Access.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

I am writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by Good Samaritan Hospital (Good Sam) that may have involved your personal information and/or protected health information, described below. At Good Sam, we take the privacy and security of all information very seriously. While we have no evidence to suggest that any of the impacted information was viewed or misused during this compromise, it is crucial that we be as supportive and transparent as possible. That is why I am writing to inform you of this incident, to offer information about steps that can be taken to help protect your information, and to let you know about complimentary credit monitoring services that we are offering you through Kroll, a global leader in risk mitigation and response. I sincerely apologize for any concern that this incident may cause you. Let me reassure you that Good Sam is dedicated to providing the best care possible, and fully committed to supporting you.

What Happened:
On November 4, 2019, Good Sam became aware of a potential compromise to several of its email accounts as a result of a targeted email phishing campaign that occurred over several days. During the course of this phishing campaign, Good Sam employees began receiving fraudulent emails that appeared to be from a known contact. These fraudulent emails contained a link to a malicious website that was designed to steal email account credentials. Upon discovery, Good Sam swiftly blocked access to the malicious website. Additionally, Good Sam immediately took steps to secure the affected accounts, which included resetting the passwords required to access the affected employee email accounts and implementing additional email and network security measures. Further, Good Sam promptly began investigating the incident with the support of a third-party expert forensics firm. Following progress by experts in their thorough investigation, it was ultimately determined that several employee email accounts experienced unauthorized access between October 28, 2019, and November 8, 2019, as a result of the above-referenced phishing campaign. Upon confirmation of the unauthorized access to Good Sam employee email accounts, Good Sam's third-party forensic experts immediately investigated whether the affected email accounts contained individuals' sensitive information. On June 24, 2020, after continued thorough investigation, Good Sam learned that the unauthorized access may have enabled access to your personal information. The information potentially impacted was within the affected employee email accounts in the normal course and scope of business as a part of regular hospital operations. There is no evidence to suggest that any Good Sam employee acted maliciously. Good Sam has worked diligently to obtain sufficient contact information to provide affected individuals with this notification. While we have no reason to believe that any information within the affected email accounts was actually viewed or misused during this compromise, we are providing this notification to you out of an abundance of caution and so that you may diligently monitor your personal information and resources. We take great care in the security of our technology systems, and regret that this incident has occurred. This incident did not involve Good Sam information systems and is limited to the affected email accounts.

What Information Was Involved:
It is important to note, as mentioned above, that there is no evidence to suggest that any personally identifiable information or personal health information has been viewed or misused. The personal information that could have been viewed by the unauthorized individual(s) may have included your first and last name, in combination with your date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, tax identification number, financial account number, treatment/diagnosis, health insurance information, billing information, doctor's name, medical record number, medical history, prescription information, Medicare/Medicaid ID, and/or patient account number.

What We Are Doing:
Good Sam has taken every step necessary to address the incident and is committed to fully protecting all of the information that you have entrusted to us. Unfortunately, phishing events have become more common and the phishing campaign experienced by Good Sam is similar to others experienced by other companies and industries. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately secured the affected accounts and took steps to enhance the security of all information, including patient information, to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. We retained a third-party forensic firm to conduct a thorough investigation and are offering you complimentary credit monitoring services.

Incident Notification

Dear Sir/Madam:

Our client, Steel Partners Holdings L.P. ("Steel Partners"), understands the importance of protecting the personal information it holds concerning New Hampshire residents. This letter supplements our initial notification to your office dated June 29, 2020 (the "Initial Notification").

Steel Partners recently discovered unauthorized activity in the email account of one of its employees. It immediately initiated an investigation, which identified unauthorized access to the email account of a Steel Partners employee. Steel Partners promptly engaged a forensic security firm to assist.

The investigation identified that the method by which the email account was accessed resulted in an automatic local download of the inbox. On May 29, 2020, it was determined that there were documents within the employee's email account that contained personal information. As anticipated in its Initial Notification, Steel Partners provided written notification on Monday, June 29 via postal mail to 21 New Hampshire residents.

As a result of its investigation, Steel Partners anticipates it will provide written notification on Tuesday, July 28 via postal mail to an additional 5 New Hampshire residents in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:20 in substantially the same form as the document enclosed herewith.

The attached letter provides additional information about the data that was improperly accessed and the steps Steel Partners has taken to remediate any vulnerabilities discovered during its investigation. In addition to notifying all three national credit reporting agencies, Steel Partners is offering two years of free credit monitoring through Experian IdentityWorks to all persons whose data has been potentially accessed as a result of the breach. In addition, Steel Partners has created a call center that potentially affected individuals can call with questions regarding the incident.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

The Credit Pros recognize the importance of protecting information. We are writing to let you know that we recently identified and addressed an incident that may have involved your information. This notice explains the incident, the measures we have taken in response, and some additional steps you may consider taking.

What Happened?

We use an online storage service for documents we receive from our clients. We recently learned that when the service was built by our vendor, the service allowed unauthenticated access requests. Upon discovering this, we immediately took steps to change the access settings for the service, a security firm was engaged, and a thorough investigation was conducted. Findings from the investigation showed unauthenticated access to files stored in the service, in relatively small amounts, from July 9, 2016 through December 2019, and then a period of concentrated unauthenticated request activity from December 12, 2019 and December 15, 2019. Because we could not identify who made these requests, we reviewed the files associated with the requests to identify the information they contained. On June 30, 2020, we identified that one or more of these files contained some of your information.

What Information Was Involved?

We identified unauthenticated request activity to one or more files that contained some of your information, including your name, address, Social Security number, and driver's license number.

What We Are Doing.

Dear CWSL Alumni,

We are writing to inform you, out of an abundance of caution, about a data security incident that may have involved your personal information.

What Happened?

A third-party vendor, Blackbaud, Inc. (the company that stores our fundraising data and services thousands of non-profits globally) notified us of a ransomware attack on its hosting system. Blackbaud informed us of the incident on July 16, 2020. Our internal data storage systems were not affected by the security incident.

What Information Was Involved?

According to Blackbaud, the ransomware attack did not disclose any credit card data, bank account data, social security numbers, or other sensitive financial information, all of which was safely encrypted. Blackbaud has not provided us with specific information yet about the type of client information accessed during the incident, but we have been working with their customer representatives and security personnel to get confirmation of the details. It is possible that contact information for some individuals may have been compromised, however, Blackbaud believes it has prevented the dissemination of any data that was accessed.

What Blackbaud is Doing.

Blackbaud has informed us there is no reason to believe that any data was or will be misused or will be further disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Blackbaud has hired a third-party team of experts to continue monitoring for any such activity.

As part of its ongoing efforts to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, Blackbaud has affirmed that it has already implemented changes to protect its system from any subsequent incidents: They have identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and taken actions to fix it. They have also confirmed through testing by multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, that their fix withstands all known attack tactics.

What We Are Doing.

We take this event very seriously. We are deeply invested in the safety and well-being of our entire community, especially our community of members, donors, and volunteers like you. We are continuing to communicate with Blackbaud and are working closely with our security and legal teams, and as we learn more about the security incident, we will provide you with updates.

What You Can Do.

In the meantime, we recommend as always to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity, phone calls, emails, or suspected identity theft to law enforcement and the appropriate service provider.

Should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us by emailing Tabatha Abeyta, our Director of Philanthropy at tabeyta@cwsl.edu with the subject line Blackbaud Security.

Sincerely,

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We are writing on behalf of The Credit Pros to notify your office of a security incident potentially involving New Hampshire residents. The Credit Pros is located at 60 Park Place, Newark, New Jersey 07102. The Credit Pros uses an online storage service for documents received from its clients. The Credit Pros recently learned that when the service was built by the vendor, the service allowed unauthenticated access requests. Upon discovering this, The Credit Pros immediately took steps to change the access settings for the service, a security firm was engaged, and a thorough investigation was conducted.

Findings from the investigation show unauthenticated access to files stored in the service, in relatively small amounts, from July 9, 2016, through December 2019, and then a period of concentrated unauthenticated request activity from December 12, 2019, to December 15, 2019. Because The Credit Pros could not identify who made the requests, The Credit Pros reviewed the files associated with the requests to identify the information they contained. On June 30, 2020, The Credit Pros determined that one or more of these documents contained the personal information of 29 New Hampshire residents, including the individuals' names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and driver's license numbers. Beginning today, The Credit Pros is notifying the New Hampshire residents via U.S. mail. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed. The Credit Pros is advising the New Hampshire residents to remain vigilant and to review their financial account statements for suspicious activity.

In addition, The Credit Pros is offering a complimentary one-year membership in credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Experian. The Credit Pros also has established a dedicated call center that individuals can call with questions about the incident or enrolling in credit monitoring. To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, The Credit Pros continues to take steps to improve its data security by, among other things, encrypting the data stored with the online storage service.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

- Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
- TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
- Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

Dear Attorney General McDonald,

Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman and Dicker LLP (Wilson Elser) represents Ferris Marketing, Inc. (Ferris), a computer and office equipment wholesaler, with respect to a potential data security incident involving Night Owl Security Products LLC (Night Owl), a subsidiary of Ferris, (hereinafter, the Incident) described in more detail below. Ferris takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

1. Nature of the security Incident.

On May 29, 2020, Ferris was alerted by Visa Inc. (VISA) that Night Owls retail website - https://nightowlsp.com/ - was the last Common Point of Purchase (CPP) for credit cards legitimately used to purchase products from Night Owl which were later used to make fraudulent purchases using VISA payment cards. Upon further investigation by Ferris, Ferris discovered on June 5, 2020 that this Incident was likely caused by an unknown cyber attackers malicious insertion of a script onto Night Owls website which allowed the cyber attacker to orchestrate a credit card fraud scheme against those who made purchases on Night Owls website after the malicious script was dropped on or around November 1, 2019 and before it was removed on June 5, 2020. At this time, Ferris has no evidence to indicate that the individual responsible for the cyber incident viewed or otherwise acquired any personal information belonging to New Hampshire residents other than names, addresses, and any payment card information previously used to make a purchase on Night Owls website.

2. Number of New Hampshire residents affected.

On or about July 13, 2020, Ferris finished identifying fifty-three (53) New Hampshire residents who were potentially affected by this Incident. Incident notification letters addressed to these individuals were mailed on July 31, 2020, via First Class Mail. A sample copy of the Incident notification letter being mailed to potentially affected residents of New Hampshire is included with this letter.

3. Steps taken.

On June 5, 2020, the same day that Ferris identified the malware infection on Night Owls retail website, Ferris removed the infection and shut down public access to Night Owls retail website. During the following twenty days, Ferris took steps to ensure the security of Night Owls website including the migration to a different hosting provider as well as the performance of upgrades to its network and software. Night Owls website reopened for public use on June 26, 2020. Ferris has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. These steps include strengthening Ferriss cybersecurity posture by implementing enhanced software monitoring programs and firewall protection to resist the future occurrence of any similar cybersecurity events. Ferris has also gone to great lengths to identify and notify any individuals who were potentially impacted as result of this Incident including the hiring of a third-party vendor to arrange for any potentially affected individuals in New Jersey to receive credit monitoring and identify theft protection services for twelve (12) months.

4. Contact information.

Ferris remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information within its control. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Robert.Walker@wilsonelser.com or (601) 499-8083.

Very truly yours,

Robert Walker	The website of Night Owls Security Products, a subsidiary of Ferris Marketing, was infected with malware by an unknown cyber attacker which allowed fraudulent purchases to be made using legitimate credit card details. Approximately 53 New Hampshire residents were potentially affected by this incident.

Dear Attorney General MacDonald,

We represent Owens Ear Center ("OEC"), a private medical Practice located in Fort Worth, TX, with respect to a data security incident described in more detail below. OEC takes the security and privacy of the information in its control very seriously, and is taking steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

On May 28, 2020, OEC suffered a ransomware attack on its computer systems. OEC believes it is likely the attacker only wanted money and not the information on its computers but, in an abundance of caution, OEC is letting its patients know that their information was encrypted by the attackers. While OEC has no reason to believe that healthcare information was accessed by the attackers, the encrypted system contained electronic healthcare records which included names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, medical insurance and related health information. One (1) New Hampshire resident may have been affected by this incident.

A notification letter to this individual was mailed by first class mail on July 27, 2020. A sample copy of the notification letter is included with this letter. Although there is no indication of fraudulent activity, in an abundance of caution, residents were offered one year of identity protection (credit monitoring and identity theft restoration) services.

OEC takes the security of all individuals' information very seriously, and wants to assure you that it is taking steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. Those steps include increasing its defenses against these rampant attacks. OEC remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information in its control.

Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>> ,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have impacted some of your personal information. We take the security of your protected health information very seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any concern this incident may cause. This letter contains information about what happened, actions we have taken to prevent a reoccurrence, and steps you can take to help protect your information.

What happened?

On May 28, 2020, we suffered a ransomware attack on our computer systems. Ransomware is a computer virus that encrypts computer systems until and unless we pay money (i.e., the ransom) demanded by the attackers. These rampant attacks continue to challenge everyone in the business and medical communities. We believe it is likely the attacker only wanted money and not the information on our computers but, in an abundance of caution, we are letting you know that your information was encrypted by the attackers. These attackers tend to be outside of the U.S. (China, North Korea, Russia), and outside the reach of law enforcement.

What information was involved?

While we have no reason to believe that your healthcare information was accessed by the attackers, the encrypted system contained your electronic healthcare records which include your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, medical insurance and related health information.

What we are doing.

We take the security of your information seriously and have taken measures to reduce the likelihood of a future cyber-attack, including increasing our defenses against these rampant attacks.

While we do not have any evidence that your information was accessed or acquired by the attackers, in an abundance of caution, we are offering the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, $1 Million Identity Fraud Loss Reimbursement, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration.

Visit https://enroll.idheadquarters.com to activate and take advantage of your identity monitoring services.

You have until October 30, 2020 to activate your identity monitoring services.

Membership Number: <<Member ID>>

Additional information describing your services is included with this letter.

What you can do.

Although we have no reports of misuse of your or anyone's information, we encourage you to follow the instructions in this letter and enroll in the identity monitoring services we are providing at no cost to you. We also recommend that you review the additional information enclosed, which contains important steps you can take to further protect your personal information.

For more information.

If you have any questions, please call 1-844-954-2390, Monday through Friday from 8:00 am - 5:30 pm Central Time. We appreciate your patience and understanding, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause you.

Sincerely,

Robert M. Owens, M.D.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Empire Golf Management, LLC ("Empire"), to notify you of a security incident. Empire recently concluded its investigation of an incident involving some of its systems. Empire first became aware of suspicious system activity on March 21, 2020. Upon identifying the suspicious activity, Empire immediately started an investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm. Through this investigation, Empire determined that an unauthorized party may have accessed some of its computer servers and workstations between the dates of February 4, 2020, and March 21, 2020.

Upon learning of this, Empire secured the involved devices and took them offline. Empire then undertook a comprehensive review of the data that could have potentially been accessed as a result of the incident and determined that the data related to some of its current and former employees and golf club members. On July 31, 2020, Empire discovered that the information involved may have included names and Social Security numbers of two (2) New Hampshire residents.

To date, Empire has no evidence that any of the information has been misused. Beginning on July 31, 2020, Empire will mail notification letters via United States Postal Service First-Class mail to two New Hampshire residents in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 359-C:20. Empire Golf is offering a complimentary one-year membership in credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through ID Experts. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed.

As a result of this review, Wrk learned on July 2, 2020, that the personal information of certain New Hampshire residents may have been accessed without authorization as a result of this incident. Wrk then worked diligently to identify up-to-date address information and to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals. The information impacted in connection with this incident may have included individuals' names as well as individuals' address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, online credentials, employee number, financial account number, routing number, healthcare provider, and/or healthcare plan.

2. Number of New Hampshire residents. Wrk notified five New Hampshire residents of this data security incident by letter sent via first-class U.S. mail on August 3, 2020. A sample copy of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals is included with this correspondence.

3. Steps taken relating to the incident. As set forth in the enclosed letter, Wrk has taken steps in response to this incident to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Those steps have included, among other things, working with leading cybersecurity experts to enhance the security of its digital environment and reporting the incident to law enforcement.

Dear First Name,

Pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:20, Wealth Enhancement Group, LLC (the parent company of Wealth Enhancement Advisory Services, LLC, a registered investment advisor) is writing to notify you about a cybersecurity incident we recently experienced and the steps we are taking to address the incident.

On March 22, 2020, an unauthorized person gained access to a limited number (three) of employees' email accounts through phishing. This incident affected the personal information of ten (10) New Hampshire residents. The information that the unauthorized party may have been able to access may have included full name, address, phone number, email address, social security number, driver's license number or state identification number, or financial account numbers.

After becoming aware of this incident, we took prompt action to secure the limited number of employees' individual email accounts to help ensure that the unauthorized person no longer had access. We also took additional steps to contain the situation, including engaging outside information security and technology experts to assist in our review and investigation of the incident.

As part of this investigation, our information security and technology experts were engaged to determine what, if any, information may have been able to be accessed. On June 11, 2020, we concluded our investigation and confirmed the individuals whose nonpublic personal information was affected by this incident. Individuals will receive written notification of this incident postmarked no later than July 23, 2020. A copy of the template notice to individuals is being sent along with this letter.

Wealth Enhancement Group has arranged for affected individuals to receive complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection for two (2) years (if individuals desire to obtain such protection) through Experian.

In addition to our existing security measures, Wealth Enhancement Group has reviewed and implemented additional options to enhance our technology and security practices to reduce the risk of a similar issue occurring in the future, including deployment of multi-factor authentication and conducting additional employee training.

We are also notifying the three largest nationwide consumer reporting agencies, including Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union, of this incident.

We hope that you, your family, and loved ones are doing as well as possible during these challenging times. As you likely know, cybersecurity-related incidents are on the rise and, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to notify you that an unauthorized person recently accessed a limited number of Wealth Enhancement Group individual employees' email accounts. Following our investigation, we have concluded that your specific nonpublic personal information may have been accessed by an unauthorized person as a result of this incident. We recognize the concern this may cause, and we want to inform you of the steps we have taken and provide you with information on steps you can take to further protect your personal information.

WHAT HAPPENED?

During our preliminary investigation, we learned that on March 22, 2020, an unauthorized person gained access to a limited number of employees' email accounts through a process called "phishing." Phishing occurs when a third-party bad actor is disguised to appear as though it is a known source requesting authorized access to user or email account information, such as a password. Because we have proactively invested in sophisticated cybersecurity technology and training, we were promptly alerted of the threat and took immediate action to secure the impacted email accounts. On June 11, 2020, we concluded our investigation and confirmed that you may have had nonpublic personal information affected by this incident.

WHAT ARE WE DOING?

After becoming aware of this incident, we took prompt action to secure the limited number of employees' individual email accounts to help ensure that the unauthorized person no longer had access. We also took additional steps to contain the situation, including engaging outside information security and technology experts to assist in our review and investigation of the incident. As part of this investigation, our information security and technology experts were engaged to determine what, if any, information may have been able to be accessed.

Because we want you to have maximum peace of mind, we are offering a complimentary 24-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection package through Experian IdentityWorks5M.

Re: Notification of Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Gordon J. MacDonald:

Be advised that the undersigned and this law firm have been retained to represent Everything Kitchens, LLC ("Everything Kitchens") in connection with the data security incident described below. Everything Kitchens is located at 6820 W. Kings Street, Springfield, MO 65802 and provides kitchenware and appliances to its customers.

On May 28, 2020, Everything Kitchens determined that criminal hackers executed a sophisticated cyber-attack on its computer systems which resulted in the attackers gaining access to the personal information of a small number of its customers who used debit or credit cards as a form of payment on May 28, 2020, including names, addresses, email address, telephone numbers, credit card numbers, credit card expiration dates, and credit card verification numbers. No Social Security numbers were compromised as a result of this attack.

Prior to this incident, Everything Kitchens had implemented a Sucuri edge-protection firewall on its public-facing site, in addition to its hosting provider, Nexcess, having its own hardware firewall. Everything Kitchens' site runs on Magento I and was regularly updated with the latest SUPEE security patches from the vendor. The entire public-facing codebase of the Magento I site was under strict source control, using monitored uncommitted files and Git repository commits. In addition, the administrative side of Everything Kitchens' site had an .htauth server level password protection, on top of the administrative panel authorization, which was whitelisted to Everything Kitchens' corporate intellectual property.

Upon learning of this incident, Everything Kitchens immediately began addressing the issue, using industry best practices and professionals who specialize in these matters. In particular, Everything Kitchens swiftly secured the server and cleaned up all malicious code, scanned the rest of the environment for malware as well as verified security patch compliance. Everything Kitchens then performed full forensics of the breach event and implemented multiple security layers to prevent further malicious activity.

Since the incident, Everything Kitchens has reworked its .htauth server level password protection, removed all whitelists, installed recently released Magento I SUPEE, eliminated the ability for customer-expos, performed a full security audit and virus scan of the server, and is in the process of setting up I frame payments through Braintree, so credit card track data cannot be compromised in transit.

Everything Kitchens notified one (1) New Hampshire resident of this incident on July 8, 2020, via U.S. mail and has partnered with ID Experts, to make available at no cost to affected individuals its MyIDCare identity theft protection solution. The MyIDCare solution includes one year of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. A sample copy of the notice sent to the New Hampshire resident is enclosed.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam,

We represent Front Rush, LLC ("Front Rush"), located at 1333 N. Kingsbury Street, FL 4, Chicago IL, 60642. Front Rush maintains data on behalf of certain data owners and is writing to notify your office, on its own behalf and their behalf, of an incident that may affect the privacy of personal information relating to one thousand, two hundred ninety-three (1,293) New Hampshire residents. Front Rush reserves the right to supplement this notice with new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Front Rush does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law, the applicability of the New Hampshire data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

Front Rush provides athletics management software solutions to academic institutions and amateur athletics organizations ("institutions"). On January 5, 2020, Front Rush was informed by a security researcher that one of its Amazon Web Services S3 buckets ("the S3 bucket") was publicly accessible from the internet. The S3 bucket contained: (a) certain attachments (like transcripts, injury reports, or athletic reports) that were placed in the platform by the institutions; and (b) certain attachments that were uploaded by student-athletes, prospective student-athletes or their parents/guardians, in response to prompts in a recruitment questionnaire formulated and disseminated by the institutions. Upon learning of this event, Front Rush immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the incident. The investigation determined that the S3 bucket was likely publicly accessible between January 18, 2016, and January 8, 2020. The investigation also determined that Front Rush's own internal database and systems were unaffected by this incident. Front Rush also contacted the security researcher, who stated that he did not save or share any copies of the data. Although Front Rush has no evidence to suggest that the S3 bucket was accessed by anyone other than the security researcher, logs were not sufficient to show whether anyone else had accessed the data. Out of an abundance of caution, Front Rush undertook a comprehensive programmatic and manual review of the entire contents of the S3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the S3 bucket and the individuals to whom it related. On January 10, 2020, Front Rush began notifying affected institutions that information relating to individuals may have been affected by this incident, based on information it had available at that time. Once Front Rush completed the comprehensive review of the entire contents of the S3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the bucket and the individuals to whom it related, Front Rush notified the affected institutions, offered to provide notification services, and worked with institutions to confirm the contact information for these individuals. These notifications were sent to the institutions on June 15, 2020.

Front Rush offered the institutions the opportunity to opt-out of notices and to provide supplemental or additional address information. The investigation determined that the following types of information related to New Hampshire residents were accessible within the S3 bucket: Social Security number, Driver's License Number/State ID Number, other identification number, and financial account information. To date, the investigation has found no evidence of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this event.

Re: Notice of Data Bre	The breach occurred because one of the Amazon Web Services S3 buckets was publicly accessible from the internet, between January 18 2016, and January 8, 2020, making it vulnerable to hacking. Although the security researcher stated that he did not share or save any copies of the data, logs were not sufficient to show whether anyone else had accessed the data.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to provide a supplemental notification of a recent data security incident suffered by Good Samaritan Hospital ("Good Sam"). We previously notified your office of this incident on June 1, 2020.

On or around November 4, 2019, Good Sam became aware of a potential compromise to several of its email accounts as a result of a targeted email phishing campaign that occurred over several days. Upon discovery, Good Sam immediately took steps to secure the affected accounts, which included resetting the passwords required to access the affected employee email accounts and implementing additional email and network security measures.

Further, Good Sam promptly began investigating the incident, which included engaging a third-party expert forensics firm. It was ultimately determined, on February 18, 2020, that several email accounts experienced unauthorized access between October 22, 2019,	The breach was due to a targeted email phishing campaign resulting in unauthorized access to several employee email accounts that were later secured by the hospital.

Dear Attorney General for the State of New Hampshire:

I am writing as the attorney for Herbaria, an all-natural soap company based out of St. Louis, Missouri. I want to make you aware that my client has recently learned that the system it used to process credit card and debit card transactions for certain purchases made through its website was compromised, which may have resulted in a compromise to credit card or debit card information of certain of your State's residents. We believe the date of such compromise started on or after June 11, 2020, and ended on July 15, 2020. We believe that one resident of your State may have been affected by this breach.

We began investigating the incident as soon as we learned of it and we engaged a third party to assist us. Since learning of this compromise, Herbaria has taken measures to ensure that future purchases through its site will be secure. We have determined that the information involved in this breach included customer name, customer billing and mailing address, credit or debit card number, and the card's expiration date and CVV.

Herbaria plans to send written notification through first-class mail to the affected residents of your State. In this letter, we will be providing:

(1) background information about the breach, including the timeframe of the breach;

(2) the types of information that may have been compromised;

(3) the steps that have been taken to address the breach and to prevent one from occurring again in the future;

(4) information, including toll-free telephone numbers, website and mailing addresses of the three credit reporting agencies;

(5) information, including the toll-free telephone number, website and mailing address of the Federal Trade Commission;

(6) information about ordering a free credit report;

(7) information about requesting a security freeze and placing fraud alerts;

(8) notice to remain vigilant in reviewing accounts and to report any suspected fraud to appropriate financial institutions;

(9) a toll-free telephone number and email address for affected residents to contact Herbaria with questions; and

(10) additional information unique to your State's data breach notification laws.

We plan to mail these notices on July 31, 2020. If you have any questions about this matter, you are welcome to contact me at 314-345-4725. My client regrets this has occurred and is committed to remain vigilant in the future to ensure its customers' personal information is protected.

Re: Notice of a Data Breach

Dear Herbaria Customer,

What Happened

We were devastated to learn recently that the system we use to process transactions through our website was breached. This may have resulted in a compromise to your credit card or debit card from June 11, 2020, through July 15, 2020. We value you as our customers, many of whom are friends and family, and we are truly sorry.

What Information Was Involved

The information involved included customer name, billing and mailing address, credit or debit card number, expiration date, and CVV.

What We Are Doing

We have notified law enforcement of this breach. Though we had taken the steps recommended to ensure our network was secure, including PCI compliance monitoring, hackers prevailed. We have since removed the malware, migrated our site to a new dedicated server and now route all traffic to our website through a certified web security firm. Our website is protected with an advanced firewall with active malware detection scanning and the ability to block attempted hacks and attacks in real-time.

What You Can Do

We recommend that you closely review the information provided in this letter for steps you can take to protect yourself against potential misuse of your credit and debit card information. Remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect fraud, report it immediately, and notify your financial institution.

To make amends, we have purchased identity theft protection for you called "myTrueldentity." The plan includes twelve months of monitoring services, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, educational materials, and access to identity protection specialists. myTrueldentity is a service of Epiq, a leading data breach and recovery company who has partnered with TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.

When prompted, enter the six-digit telephone passcode <<Insert six-digit Passcode>> and follow the steps to enroll in the offline credit monitoring service, add an initial fraud alert to your credit file, or to speak to a TransUnion representative if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft.

Notice of a Data Breach

Dear:

Please read this letter in its entirety. We are writing you to inform you of a data security incident that may have affected your personal information. At Romanazzi & Associates, we take the privacy and security of all personal information within our possession very seriously. We are contacting you, offering complimentary Credit, Non-credit and Cyber Monitoring including identity theft resolution services, and providing information on steps you can take to further protect your personal information.

What happened?

On April 22, 2020, we learned that fraudulent tax returns were filed for a few of our clients. Based on this information, we contacted our tax software vendor and the Internal Revenue Service as well as the local police and FBI offices to investigate the issue. We also engaged IT professionals to perform a scan and analysis of our system. We immediately took steps to secure the access to our systems and tax software and the client information contained therein.

The cyber investigation determined that suspicious activity had occurred with one workstation as a result the tax software information was captured. There was no conclusive evidence as to where the breach occurred. After concluding that there was an occurrence, we set in place with the IRS an Opt-In system to keep fraudulent returns from processing. As your information may have been impacted, we are writing to inform you of this incident and to provide you with information about steps that can be taken to help protect your information.

* Services marked with an * require an internet connection and e-mail account and may not be available to minors under the age of 18 years of age. Please note that when signing up for monitoring services, you may be asked to verify personal information for your own protection to confirm your identity.

What information was involved?

The information impacted in connection with this incident may have included your name, address, and social security number as well as information pertaining to your past and current tax filings with the IRS and state taxing authorities.

What are we doing to address this situation?

As soon as we discovered this incident, we took the steps described above. We also notified the Internal Revenue Service, the state tax agencies and law enforcement officials in an attempt to help prevent fraudulent activity. As part of our notification with the IRS, the IRS is monitoring the tax filings of our clients to detect and reject any fraudulent filings. Romanazzi & Associates on April 22, 2020, made immediate enhancements to our systems, security and practices. Additionally, we have engaged appropriate experts to assist us in conducting a full review of our security practices and systems to ensure that appropriate security protocols are in place going forward. We are committed to helping those people who may have been impacted by this unfortunate situation.

If you have received a 2019 income tax refund check directly from the Internal Revenue Service and the amount does not appear to be correct or you have not filed at this time please bring the check to Romanazzi & Associates so that it may be returned and not affect your tax account. If you cash the check or deposit it, the amount will eventually have to be repaid to the Internal Revenue Service. Also, interest and penalties may apply.

In response to the incident, we are offering you services provided by CyberScout, a company specializing in identity theft education and resolution. CyberScout representatives are available for 90 days from the date of this letter, to assist you with questions regarding this incident, between the hours of 8 am to 5 pm Eastern	The cyber investigation determined suspicious activity from one workstation and the tax software information was captured, indicating an outside party or malware was responsible for the data breach. There was no conclusive evidence as to where the breach occurred.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear Christopher,

We are writing to inform you about a recent security incident. Please click on the personalized link provided in this email for next steps and resources created specifically for your organization.

What Happened:

The Cybercrime industry is a constantly growing and changing threat to all companies worldwide. At Blackbaud, our Cyber Security team successfully defends against millions of attacks each month and is constantly studying the landscape to ensure we stay ahead of this sophisticated criminal industry. In May 2020, we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. In a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. After discovering the attempted attack, our Cyber Security team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files, and ultimately expelled them from our system.

Prior to our locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment. The cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. Because protecting our customers' data was our top priority, we paid the cybercriminals' demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed.

Based on the nature of the incident, our research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. In accordance with regulatory requirements and in an abundance of caution, we are notifying all organizations whose data was part of this incident and are providing resources and tools to help them assess this incident.

What This Means for Your Organization Specifically:

Our public cloud environment (Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services) and most of our self-hosted datacenters, products, and customers were not part of this incident, but we have confirmed the following specific to your organization:

A copy of your Blackbaud eTapestry backup was part of this incident. Again, the file the cybercriminal removed a copy of did not contain any credit card information. Further, the cybercriminal did not gain access to bank account information, usernames, passwords, or social security numbers stored in your database because they were encrypted. None of your data was lost or corrupted as a result of this incident. And again, based on the nature of the incident, our research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. We have hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web as an extra precautionary measure.

We have created a resource page for you at www.blackbaud.com/incidentresources that features a toolkit with a step-by-step guide to help you as you digest this information. It also contains answers to key questions, links to educational webinars (hosted by Rich Friedberg, Blackbaud's Chief Information Security Officer and Cameron Stoll, our Head of Privacy), information about our future plans, and other resources.

It is unlikely but possible, depending on jurisdiction, that our customers may have to make further notifications to constituents or other third parties. Your toolkit provides a written guide to notification laws and access to a webinar that helps you assess potential notification requirements in your jurisdictions. We advise you to also consult with your organization's legal counsel to understand any notification requirements. We want to continue to be your partner through this incident. If you determine that you do need to notify your constituents, we have included templates in your toolkit to make it easier.

To ensure all your questions are answered as quickly as possible, we encourage you to first review the resources we provided at the link above. If you still have questions after reviewing these resources, we are here to help. Please contact the dedicated team we have established for this incident:

North and South America: 1-855-907-2099 between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. ET Monday - Friday

We understand this situation is frustrating. This was a very sophisticated attack, and while we were able to defend against it for the most part, we realize this is still requiring that you invest time to review the situation, and that you may need to invest time to take follow-up actions. We apologize for this and will continue to do our very best to supply help and support as we and our customers jointly navigate any necessary response to the cybercriminals' actions.

Sincerely,

Todd Lant
Chief Information Officer	The breach was caused by a successful ransomware attack on Blackbaud's self-hosted environment that happened in May 2020. The cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data, which included a copy of eTapestry backup of Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

As soon as we became aware of the suspicious activity, we immediately took measures to secure the email accounts and launched an internal investigation. A cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist in a forensic analysis of this incident. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized person accessed these four employee email accounts, although we could not determine whether any specific emails or attachments were viewed by the unauthorized person. We were not able to conclusively rule out that possibility, however.

Out of an abundance of caution, we searched the full contents of the employee email accounts to identify individuals whose information could have been accessible to the unauthorized person. We determined that an email or attachment contained your <<variable data>>.

Re: Notification of a Computer Security Incident Involving Personal Information Pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:20

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We represent Doylestown Hospital and Doylestown Health Physicians (jointly referred to as Doylestown) in connection with an incident that involved the personal information of one (1) New Hampshire resident, and provide this notice on behalf of Doylestown pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:20(I)(b). This notice will be supplemented, if necessary, with any new significant facts discovered subsequent to its submission. While Doylestown is notifying you of this incident, Doylestown does not waive any rights or defenses relating to the incident or this notice, or the applicability of New Hampshire law on personal jurisdiction.

NATURE OF THE SECURITY INCIDENT OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

PaperlessPay Corporation (PaperlessPay) recently notified Doylestown of a security incident that it experienced. Doylestown contracts with PaperlessPay for the provision of online bi-weekly paystubs and W-2 tax forms. According, to PaperlessPay, on February 19, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contacted PaperlessPay and notified it that someone was purporting to sell access to PaperlessPay's client database on the dark web. PaperlessPay shut down its web server and SQL server to prevent unauthorized access. PaperlessPay worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and retained a cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation. The investigation revealed that someone accessed PaperlessPay's SQL server on February 18, 2020. Doylestown and PaperlessPay worked together to obtain additional information concerning the incident, including what, if any information the threat-actor may have acquired.

At this point, Doylestown is not aware of an unauthorized access or acquisition of its employees' personal information or that any of the information has been misused. However, PaperlessPay could not definitely rule out the possibility that someone accessed or acquired Doylestown employees' personal information. Accordingly, Doylestown is notifying the potentially impacted employees and arranged for complementary identity theft protection services for the employees.

NUMBER OF NEW HAMPSHIRE RESIDENTS AFFECTED

Doylestown determined that one (1) New Hampshire resident may have been impacted by this incident. On August 4, 2020, Doylestown notified the impacted individual of the situation by letter. Enclosed is a copy of the notice that is being sent to the impacted individual.

STEPS TAKEN RELATING TO THE INCIDENT

Upon becoming aware of the incident, Doylestown promptly investigated the incident to determine what, if any, personal information a third party might have acquired during the incident. Doylestown is also providing complimentary identity theft protection services to the impacted individual through Experian.

CONTACT INFORMATION

Please contact me if you have any questions or if I can provide you with any further information concerning this matter.

Dear Full_Name:

At Peabody Properties, Inc. we understand the importance of protecting and securing the personal information that we maintain. We are writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?
We conducted an investigation involving suspicious activity in Peabody employees email accounts. Upon learning of the incident, we secured the employees email accounts, launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident, and a computer security firm was engaged to assist. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person had access to the contents of some of the employees accounts at times between November 14, 2019 and January 14, 2020.

What Information Was Involved?
The investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized individual viewed or accessed emails in the accounts, but we could not rule out that possibility. We therefore reviewed the contents of the email accounts and, on May 18, 2020, we determined that an email or attachment contained your personal information, including your Variable_Text.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Melanie Flowers, Privacy Officer at BeneSys, Inc., a Michigan company, wrote a letter to Attorney General Gordon MacDonald of New Hampshire on August 6, 2020, to inform him of a security event pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. 359 C:20. BeneSys is the third-party administrator for employee benefit plans, including health benefit plans. On July 22, 2020, a file containing the personal information of multiple plan participants in a client's plan was accidentally sent to a participant through their encrypted secure email system. The error was discovered on July 27, 2020, when the participant first opened the file with the personal information and immediately alerted them to the error. The file included participants' first and last names, Social Security numbers, and bank account and routing numbers. One resident of New Hampshire was included in the disclosure. They obtained a declaration from the recipient confirming that the file was permanently deleted and not further disseminated. Because the Trust is a covered entity under the Health Insurance Privacy and Protection Act (HIPAA), the event will be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services. They informed the client of the event on July 28, 2020, and all affected participants were sent a letter on July 31, 2020, explaining the event and steps they could take to protect their personal information. The letter also contained an offer of 24 months of no-cost credit monitoring service from Experian. They are implementing additional training to reduce the risk of similar errors in the future. The letter also includes information on what affected individuals can do to protect their personal information and what BeneSys is doing to address the issue.	The file containing personal information was accidentally sent to a plan participant through their encrypted secure email system, which was immediately alerted to BeneSys, Inc. Because it was a mistake and not a result of hacking, insider activity, or physical loss, this breach falls under the unintended disclosure (DISC) category.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Blackbaud Breach Q&A for Businesses, Nonprofits, and Legal Counsel:

In mid-July, Blackbaud, a software provider used by a significant portion of the nonprofit community, reported a ransomware attack that took place in May 2020 and resulted in the acquisition of data by cybercriminals. According to public statements, Blackbaud claims that it has no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly, but, to date, has not announced any concrete substantiation of this claim. It is generally difficult to prove that a cybercriminal that has acquired sensitive data has deleted it, and absent affirmative proof, one should treat that data as acquired or breached under Vermont's laws. The Attorney General's Office (AGO) is encouraged by how quickly users of Blackbaud's software have moved to ensure compliance with Vermont and other states' Security Breach Notice Acts by issuing notices to their customers, donors, and others. This Q&A attempts to address some issues that have arisen and provides suggestions based on information that is currently publicly available. The details of this incident, however, may develop over time.

What is considered a security breach? An incident is only considered a security breach if (i) the subset of data defined as Personally Identifiable Information or PII is acquired, and (ii) that data is unencrypted. Blackbaud's public statement is that no unencrypted credit card information, bank account information, or Social Security numbers were acquired. While these are the most common types of PII implicated, Vermont law also includes other data as PII: government identification numbers like driver's licenses and passports; health information, including health insurance policy numbers; genetic information; biometric information; and login credentials. The AGO is not aware that Blackbaud has commented on these data types. If a nonprofit has entered any PII, like a Social Security number, into an otherwise unencrypted field, like a freeform text field, that information should be assumed to have been acquired, resulting in a breach. A full explanation of Vermont's Security Breach Notice Act can be found in this recently issued guidance.

Is Vermont's Breach Notice Act the right state's law to comply with? Organizations should comply with Vermont's Act with regard to all consumers affected by the breach who reside in Vermont. If an organization must notify anyone outside of Vermont, it must comply with the law of the state in which the consumer resides.

How should a Blackbaud user respond to this incident? Many organizations appear to be issuing notice without clarifying whether or not a consumer's PII was affected. While the AGO appreciates the desire for transparency, notices like this, particularly coming from multiple sources as is occurring here, can create anxiety without providing needed clarity to consumers: If an organization knows with certainty that it has not stored any PII in a Blackbaud system, or has only stored it in fields that Blackbaud claims to be encrypted, then that organization has not experienced a security breach and has no obligation under Vermont law to issue notice. If an organization is uncertain of this fact, and cannot confirm one way or the other, it should treat this as a security breach and follow the Vermont Security Breach Act Notice Guidance.

Is a Blackbaud user required to issue notice if no PII was breached? The AGO understands that many organizations wish to be as open as possible with customers and donors and may want to issue notice even if no PII was affected. Some information stored in the Blackbaud database, like home values, income levels, or even personal preferences, is not considered PII but would still be the sort of information that many consumers would like to know has been accessed. If an organization is certain that a breach as defined by the law has not occurred (that is, unencrypted PII was not involved), but still wishes to issue notice, the AGO encourages you to be as clear as possible. This may include the following elements, but, again, note that none of this is obligatory. Explain that the customers, donors, or others may have heard about the Blackbaud breach. State that, based on representations from Blackbaud no PII was acquired, if applicable. If there are pieces of sensitive information that are not PII involved, you may want to disclose those. None of this is obligatory. We are recommending this to avoid notices that people may find confusing. Include a warning that phishing scams often occur in the wake of a breach and that you will not call or email the consumer asking them for their login credentials, credit card number, or other financial information. Furthermore, you do not accept payment in the form of gift cards and would never request them. If a notice of non-breach is being issued, the AGO does not need to be informed of it. Breach notices, as usual, must be sent to the AGO, where they are posted on its website.

If you have any questions or are uncertain about anything in the guidance, please contact ago.securitybreach@vermont.gov or 802-828-5479.	The breach was a result of a ransomware attack by cybercriminals.

Since discovering the error, we have addressed the employee involved who sent the file and have taken steps to reduce the risk of similar incidents. We sincerely apologize for this error and understand the concern it may cause you. Given the report and level of cooperation by the participant who received the file in error, we have no reason to believe that your information was further disclosed or compromised. The privacy and protection of the information to which we are entrusted is a top priority of BeneSys and the Trust.

What You Should Do To Protect Your Personal Information: We recommend you remain vigilant and consider taking one or more of the following steps to protect your personal information:

1. Contact the nationwide credit-reporting agencies as soon as possible to:

- Add a fraud alert statement to your credit file at all three-national credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You only need to contact one of the three agencies listed below; your request will be shared with the other two agencies. This alert will remain on your credit file for 90 days. A fraud alert alerts credit or of possible fraudulent activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. Once the fraud alert is added to your credit report, all creditors should contact you prior to establishing any account in your name.
- Add a security freeze to your credit file. A security freeze prevents your credit account from being shared with potential creditors, which can help prevent new account identity theft. If you would like to request a security freeze be placed on your account, you must write by certified or overnight mail (see addresses below) to each of the three credit reporting agencies, or through the electronic or Internet method made available by the credit reporting agencies. Credit reporting agencies charge a $5 fee to place or remove a security freeze, unless you provide proof that you are a victim of identity theft, in which case there is no fee. A copy of a police report or an investigative report or written FTC complaint documenting identity theft must be included to avoid a fee. In your request, you also must include (documentation for both the spouse and the victim must be submitted when requesting for the spouse's credit report) (i) a copy of either the police report or case number documenting the identity theft, if you are a victim of identity theft; (ii) your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.,) address, Social Security number, and date of birth; (iii) if you have moved in the past 5 years, the addresses where you have lived over the prior 5 years; (iv) proof of current address such as a current utility bill or phone bill; (v) a photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and, if applicable (vi) payment by check, money order or credit card (Visa, Master Card, American Express or Discover cards only.)
- Remove your name from mailing lists of pre-approved offers of credit for approximately six months.
- Obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.annualcreditreport.com.

Equifax P.O. Box 740256 Atlanta, GA 30374 (800) 525-6285 www.equifax.com
Experian P.O. Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 (888) 397-3742 www.experian.com
TransUnion P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19022 (800) 888-4213 www.transunion.com

2. Review all bills and credit card statements closely to determine whether you have been charged for items you did not contract for or purchase. Review all of your bank account statements frequently for checks, purchases, or deductions not made by you. Note that even if you do not find suspicious activity initially, you should continue to check this information periodically since identity thieves sometimes delay their use of stolen personal information.

3. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers consumer assistance and educational materials relating to identity theft, privacy issues, and how to avoid identity theft. You can also obtain information from the FTC about fraud alerts and security freezes. You may contact the FTC by visiting www.ftc.gov or www.consumer.gov/idtheft, calling (877) 438-4338, or writing to the FTC at the address below. If you suspect or know that you are the victim of identity theft, you should contact local police. You can also report such activity to the Fraud Department of the FTC, which will collect all relevant information and make it available to law-enforcement agencies. The mailing address for the FTC is: Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20580. You may also obtain information about fraud alerts and security freezes from your state Attorney General and the credit reporting agencies.

4. We also recommend you closely monitor your financial accounts and access resources concerning identity theft, such as information the Internal Revenue Services has published at: http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Identity-Protection and https://www.irs.gov/uac/Taxpayer-Guide-to-Identity-Theft. As discussed in the Taxpayer Guide to Identity Theft, IRS Form 14039 can be filed with the IRS to report potential identity theft concerning your federal taxes. You also may want to check with the state(s) in which you file.

Dear [Recipient],

The Connection Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy and security of the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

On June 8, 2020, The Connection concluded our investigation of an incident that involved unauthorized access to two of our employees' email accounts. The Connection first learned of this incident on February 13, 2020, when an employee reported experiencing issues receiving email. Upon learning of this, we immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of an outside professional IT security firm.

Through our investigation, we learned that unauthorized parties accessed two employees' email accounts between January 4, 2020, and February 13, 2020. The unauthorized parties also attempted to change The Connection employees' direct deposit information with our payroll department. Although it appears that the purpose of the unauthorized access to the accounts was to change the employees' direct deposit information and fraudulently obtain funds from The Connection, we could not rule out the possibility that unauthorized parties may have been able to access emails and attachments in the accounts.

As part of our investigation, we conducted a comprehensive review of the emails and attachments in the email accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized parties as a result of this incident. Through this review, we determined that the unauthorized parties may have accessed emails and attachments that contain your name in combination with your Social Security number and affiliation with The Connection.

To date, we are unaware of any misuse of the information maintained in the two employees' email accounts. However, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously.

As a precaution, we have secured the services of Experian to offer you a complimentary one-year membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM. This product helps detect possible misuse of your information and provides you with identity protection support focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorks is completely free, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on IdentityWorks, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take to protect yourself, please see the pages that follow this letter.

To help prevent something like this from happening again, we have implemented multi-factor authentication for remote access to email and are now providing additional cybersecurity training to employees.

We deeply regret any concern this incident may cause you. If you have any questions, please call 1-888-675-0090, Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Eastern Time.

Attorney General MacDonald:

Seth Berman
Direct Line: (617) 439-2338
Fax: (617) 310-9338
E-mail: sberrnan@nutter.com

My firm represents St. John's Preparatory School, an all-boys Catholic preparatory school for grades 6 through 12 located in Danvers, Massachusetts (St. John's Prep). Pursuant to N .H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:20 , I am writing to notify you of a data breach involving the personal information of twenty-five New Hampshire residents.

On Thursday, July 16, 2020, St. John's Prep was notified by Blackbaud Inc., a third-party software company that St. John's Prep and many other schools and non-profit organizations use as a database for advancement operations and financial accounting information, of a security breach involving accounts at Blackbaud. According to Blackbaud, in May 2020, Blackbaud discovered that cybercriminals had accessed their system and executed a ransomware attack. Blackbaud's investigation showed that the cybercriminals copied and exfiltrated certain data from Blackbaud's self-hosted environment before the hackers were locked out of the system. The hackers may have had access as early as February 7, 2020.

Blackbaud has informed St John's Prep that its investigation showed that the cybercriminals were ultimately expelled from Blackbaud's system on or about May 20, 2020. We do not know why it took Blackbaud from May 20, 2020 until July 16, 2020 to inform us about the incident.

Blackbaud shared the following additional details regarding the data breach:

In May of 2020, we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. In a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. After discovering the attack, our Cyber Security team-together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement-successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from our system. Prior to our locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment.

The cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. Because protecting our customers' data was our top priority, we paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed. Based on the nature of the incident, our research, and third party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

Blackbaud informed St. John's Prep that a legacy St. John's Prep backup file from August 2019, stored by a Blackbaud vendor and kept according to Blackbaud policies, had been compromised. Blackbaud assured St. John's Prep that the database containing credit card, bank account, user names, passwords and social security numbers were encrypted, and thus that information could not have been accessed by the cybercriminals.

A few weeks before St. John's Prep was notified of the Blackbaud breach, it had discovered that a small subset of individuals had social security or credit card numbers that had been inadvertently entered into an unencrypted "Notes" field in its Blackbaud database. St. John's Prep deleted these inadvertent entries at that time. Once it learned of the Blackbaud breach, St. John's Prep determined from Blackbaud that the backup database that may have been accessed by the hackers predated St. John's Prep's attempt to remove the social security numbers and credit card numbers inadvertently stored in unencrypted fields in the database. Consequently, St. John's Prep is formally notifying and offering credit monitoring to those New Hampshire individuals whose social security numbers were in these unencrypted fields in the backup database exposed during the breach.

In addition to these twenty-five individuals in New Hampshire who we are formally notifying pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:20, there were approximately 1,920 additional New Hampshire individuals in the database whose data did not include personal information.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Peabody Properties, Inc. ("Peabody"), to notify you of a security incident. Peabody is located in Braintree, Massachusetts.

Peabody recently completed an investigation involving unauthorized access to several employees' email accounts. Upon first learning of the incident, Peabody secured the employees' email accounts, launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident, and a computer security firm was engaged to assist.

The investigation determined that an unauthorized person may have had access to the contents of the employees' email account at times between November 14, 2019, and January 14, 2020. The investigation could not definitively determine whether the unauthorized individual actually viewed or accessed any of the emails in the accounts; however, Peabody was not able to rule out that possibility.

Peabody searched the contents of the accounts to identify documents containing personal information. On May 18, 2020, Peabody determined that an email or attachment in the accounts contained the names, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, limited health information, and/or financial account numbers of 54 New Hampshire residents.

Beginning today, Peabody is providing notice via postal mail to the potentially affected New Hampshire residents in accordance with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 359-C:20.1. A copy of the notification letter is enclosed. Peabody has offered the potentially affected New Hampshire residents whose Social Security numbers and/or driver's license numbers were involved in the incident a complimentary one-year membership in credit monitoring services through Experian. Peabody has also established a dedicated call center for individuals to	The breach was due to unauthorized access to several employees' email accounts, and it could not be determined definitively whether unauthorized individuals accessed any of the emails or not. Personal information, including Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, limited health information, and financial account numbers of 54 residents, were found in the accounts.

What Happened?

On January 29, 2020, American Seating became aware of suspicious activity relating to certain American Seating employee email accounts. In response, American Seating worked with third party forensic specialists to investigate the nature and scope of the activity. We determined that two American Seating email accounts were accessed without authorization. The period of unauthorized access varied for each account at issue. Every potentially accessible email and attachment within the impacted accounts was reviewed to determine what information may have been accessible to the unauthorized actor. On April 28, 2020, we determined the total potentially affected population of this event. Since that time, American Seating worked to find contact information for impacted individuals to ensure those impacted individuals received notice of this event.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Northwest alumni and friends,

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident involving Blackbaud, Inc., a service provider of the Northwest Foundation. As you may be aware, Blackbaud, an engagement and fundraising software service provider, recently experienced a data breach. Northwest Foundation is one of many schools and non-profits that have been affected. The Foundation takes our relationship with you and our data protection responsibilities very seriously. Please be assured that we do not store social security numbers or bank account numbers and that type of information was not accessed by the cybercriminal. Blackbaud also assured us that the file accessed by the cybercriminal did not contain any credit card information and that they use encryption to store any financial account information. Further details are below, including steps we have taken in response.

What Happened

On July 16, 2020, we were contacted by Blackbaud, one of the world's largest providers of customer relationship management systems for not-for-profit organizations and the higher education sector. Company representatives informed us that a Blackbaud service provider had been the victim of a ransomware attack that culminated in May 2020. The cybercriminal was unsuccessful in blocking access to the database involved in the attack, however, the cybercriminal was able to remove a copy of a subset of data from several of Blackbaud's clients including data of Northwest Foundation.

What Information Was Involved

We would like to reassure our constituents that a detailed forensic investigation was undertaken, on behalf of Blackbaud, by law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity experts. As noted above, Blackbaud has confirmed that the investigation found that the cybercriminal did not access your credit or debit card information, bank account information, or social security number because that information was stored in an encrypted format. Also note that Northwest Foundation does not store social security numbers or bank account information. The Northwest Foundation data accessed by the cybercriminal in the Blackbaud database may have contained some of the following information in some of the data records:

- Public information such as name, title, date of birth, spouse
- Addresses and contact details such as phone numbers and e-mail addresses
- Philanthropic interests, giving capacity, and giving history to the Northwest Foundation
- Educational attainment

The student records of Northwest Missouri State University were not involved in this incident.

What Blackbaud Is Doing

We have been informed by Blackbaud that in order to protect constituent data of Blackbaud clients like Northwest Foundation and mitigate potential identity theft, it met the cybercriminal's ransomware demand. Blackbaud has advised us that it has received assurances from the cybercriminal and third-party experts that the data was destroyed and thus is no longer usable or accessible by any unauthorized persons or entities. Blackbaud informs us that it continues to monitor the web in an effort to verify the data accessed by the cybercriminal has not been misused.

Steps We Have Taken in Response

Upon notification of this breach by Blackbaud, we immediately launched our investigation and have taken the following steps:

- We are notifying affected alumni and friends to make them aware of this breach of Blackbaud's systems;
- We are working with Blackbaud to understand why there was a delay between it finding the breach and notifying us, as well as what actions Blackbaud is taking to increase its security;
- We are conferring with other Blackbaud clients to share information about this breach, resulting corrective actions, and identify any additional recommended best practices.

Additional notifications regarding this incident will be posted to https://www.nwmissouri.edu/alumni/blackbaud.htm.

What You Can Do

We do not believe there is a need for our constituents to take any action at this time. Although there is currently no evidence that your information has been misused, as a best practice, we recommend people remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious account activity or suspected identity theft to the proper authorities.

For questions related to the security incident, contact Lori Steiner, Northwest Foundation Chief Finance Officer, 660-562-1411, foundation@nwmissouri.edu. We will continue to work with Blackbaud to investigate this incident. We regret the inconvenience that this data breach may have caused and share your frustration. Please be assured that we take data protection very seriously and are grateful for the continued support of our alumni and friends.

Sincerely,

Dr. Bob Burrell
President, Northwest Foundation, Inc.	The breach was caused by a ransomware attack on Blackbaud, a service provider of the Northwest Foundation, that occurred in May 2020, as stated in the data breach notification.

I am writing to provide notification of an incident at Beaumont that may affect the security of personal information of one (1) New Hampshire resident. Beaumont's investigation is ongoing and this notification will be supplemented with any new or significant facts or findings subsequent to this submission, if any. By providing this notice, Beaumont does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law or personal jurisdiction.

Beaumont was the target of an email phishing campaign that resulted in an unauthorized individual gaining access to the email accounts of a small number of employees. Upon learning of the issue, Beaumont commenced a prompt and thorough investigation, working closely with external cybersecurity professionals. After an extensive forensic investigation and comprehensive manual document review, Beaumont discovered on June 5, 2020 that one or more of the email accounts that were accessed between January 3, 2020 and January 29, 2020 contained some of the resident's personal and protected health information. One or more of the email accounts contained the following information about the resident: medical diagnosis, date you received medical care, and your age.

Beaumont has no indication that any information has been misused. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, Beaumont wanted to inform you (and the affected resident) of the incident and to explain the steps that it is taking to help safeguard the affected resident against identity fraud. Beaumont will provide the affected resident with written notification of this incident commencing on or about July 28, 2020 in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto. The affected resident is being provided with advice on steps he or she can take to prevent medical identity theft.

At Beaumont, protecting the privacy of personal information is a top priority. Beaumont has taken significant measures to prevent this from happening again, including improving its multi-factor authentication software, conducting an enterprise-wide risk analysis, and retraining its workforce on identifying and responding to phishing attacks. Beaumont is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information in its possession and has taken many precautions to safeguard it. Beaumont will continue to evaluate and modify its practices and internal controls to enhance the security and privacy of personal information.

Notice is being provided pursuant to the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, 45 CFR 164.400, et seq. Should you have any questions regarding this notification, please contact me at (248)-220-1354 or jgiszczak@mcdonaldhopkins.com.

We have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online three-bureau credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for one year. The service is provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.

Privacy laws do not allow us to register you directly to the monitoring service. To enroll in this service, go to the myTrueIdentity website at www.mytrueidentity.com and in the space referenced as Enter Activation Code, enter the following 12-letter Activation Code: <<Insert Unique 12-letter Activation Code>> and follow the three steps to receive access to the credit monitoring service online within minutes.

If you do not have access to the Internet, you may enroll in a similar offline paper-based credit monitoring service via U.S. mail delivery, by calling the TransUnion Fraud Response Services toll-free hotline at 1-855-288-5422, and when prompted, enter this code: 696518 and follow the steps to enroll in the offline credit monitoring service.

You may also add an initial fraud alert to your credit file or speak to a TransUnion representative if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft. You can sign up for the online or offline credit monitoring service anytime within the next 90 days. Please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with TransUnion, Experian, or Equifax, or an address in the United States or its territories, and a valid Social Security number. Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

Once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain one year of unlimited access to your TransUnion credit report and credit score. The daily three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at TransUnion, Experian, or Equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, changes of address, and more. The service also includes access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (Policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

You should also consider placing a "fraud alert" or "security alert" on your credit file. An alert helps warn creditors checking your file that recent fraudulent activity may have occurred or may occur in the future. A potential creditor would then know to contact you before opening any new accounts. To place a fraud alert, contact the credit reporting agencies directly:

Equifax
PO Box 105851
Atlanta, GA 30348
888-766-0008
www.equifax.com

Experian

www.experian.com

TransUnion
PO Box 1000
Chester, PA 19016
800-680-7289
www.transunion.com

When you place any type of fraud alert on your credit file, the credit reporting agencies will send you a free copy of your credit report. Look for accounts that are not yours, debts you do not owe, or any other inaccuracies (e.g., wrong social security number or home address). If you find an error, contact the credit reporting agency directly. By law, that credit reporting agency must investigate and respond.

You should also monitor your financial statements for unauthorized activity. To learn more about identity theft, visit the Federal Trade Commission's Your National Resource about Identity Theft guidance materials at www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

We determined that this is an isolated incident. You can rest assured that we take this situation seriously and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again. This notification was not delayed due to a law enforcement investigation. We at MetLife remain committed to doing everything we can to protect your privacy.

If you have any questions about this situation, please call us Monday through Friday between 9 am 5 pm (EST/EDT) at Insert MetLife Telephone Number. We deeply regret any inconvenience caused by this incident.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Select Express & Logistics ("Select") located at 55 W 39th St, 15th floor, New York, NY 10018, and write, on behalf of Select, to notify your Office of an incident that may affect the security of certain personal information of approximately four (4) New Hampshire residents.

By providing this notice, Select does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law, the New Hampshire data breach notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On May 3, 2020, Select learned of suspicious activity impacting the operability of certain Select systems. Select immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. Working with third-party forensic investigators, Select determined that an unknown actor encrypted certain systems using malware, and also used malware to acquire a small number of files from Select's server.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Behavioral Health Network, Inc. ("BHN") located at 417 Liberty Street, Springfield, MA 01104, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to one hundred fifty-two (152) New Hampshire residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, BHN does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law, the applicability of the New Hampshire data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On May 28, 2020, certain BHN systems became infected with a virus that prohibited access to its files. Upon discovery, BHN immediately commenced an investigation, which included working with third-party IT and forensic investigators, to determine the full nature and scope of the incident and to secure the BHN network. Through this investigation, BHN determined that an unauthorized actor had placed malware within the BHN environment that disrupted the operation of certain BHN systems. On or about July 17, 2020, BHN's investigation further determined that the unauthorized actor had gained access to certain BHN systems between May 26, 2020, and May 28, 2020. As a result, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain files within these systems. While the investigation was able to determine these BHN systems were accessed, it was unable to determine whether any specific file containing sensitive information was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, BHN is notifying all current and former individuals served and employees of this incident because the following types of information were present in the affected systems: name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, medical/diagnosis/treatment information, and/or health insurance claim information.

Notice to New Hampshire Residents

On or about July 27, 2020, BHN began providing notice of this incident to affected individuals, which includes one hundred fifty-two (152) New Hampshire residents. Written notice is being provided beginning on August 7, 2020, in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A. BHN also posted notice of this incident on its website. A copy of BHN's website notice is attached here as Exhibit B.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, BHN moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of BHN systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. BHN is also working to review existing policies and procedures, to implement additional safeguards, and to provide additional training to its employees. While the investigation was unable to determine whether any specific file containing sensitive information was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor, BHN, in an abundance of caution, is providing access to twelve months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services, through Kroll, to individuals whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident, at no cost to these individuals. Additionally, BHN is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing their Explanation of Benefits, account statements, and credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Vermont Public Radio ("VPR"), to notify you of a security incident involving one New Hampshire resident.

On July 16, 2020, VPR was notified by Blackbaud of a ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network that the company discovered in May of 2020. Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, VPR conducted its own investigation of the Blackbaud services it uses and the information provided by Blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. On July 29, 2020, VPR determined that the backup file contained images of checks payable to VPR with the name and account number of one New Hampshire resident.

Beginning today, VPR is providing written notice via United States Postal Service First-Class mail to this New Hampshire resident pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 359-C:20, in the same form as the enclosed letter.

Blackbaud has informed VPR that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

VPR has implemented additional check imaging procedures to redact account number from check images.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

David E. Kitchen
Partner

On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified us that it had discovered a ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the Blackbaud services we use, and the information provided by Blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. The backup files contained member demographic information, contact information, donation dates and amounts. On July 29, 2020, we determined that the backup files contained an image of a check with your name and account number ending in -XXXX. Blackbaud assured us that no encrypted data such as Social Security numbers and credit and debit card information was accessible to the unauthorized person. Blackbaud also assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Blackbaud has hired a third-party team of experts to continue monitoring for any such activity.

Although we have no indication that your information has been misused, we encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements for any unauthorized activity. For more information on identity theft prevention, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

We are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that we, and Blackbaud, are taking in response. Blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms. VPR has implemented additional check imaging procedures to redact account number from check images.

Your confidence and trust are important to us, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. Should you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at membership@vpr.org.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir or Madam:

Our office represents Summit Medical Associates ("Summit"), located at 4656 W. Jefferson Blvd, Suite 125, Fort Wayne, IN 46804. We write on behalf of Summit to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to one (1) New Hampshire resident. This notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Summit does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law, the applicability of the New Hampshire data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On or about June 5, 2020, Summit discovered that it was unable to access certain data and records stored on its server. Summit immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of third-party forensic computer experts, to determine the nature and scope of the incident. It was determined that certain information was encrypted by ransomware. Summit's investigation determined there was potential unauthorized access to its server between January 24, 2020, and June 5, 2020. Summit then worked to identify its patients whose personal information may have been accessible to the unauthorized actor. That process concluded July 28, 2020. Though we have no evidence the unauthorized actor actually accessed or acquired personal or protected information on Summit's server, out of an abundance of caution, Summit is providing notice to individuals whose information may have been impacted by the event.

The type of personal information related to the affected New Hampshire resident which may have been accessible to the unauthorized actor included the following: name, medical information, and Social Security number.

Notice to New Hampshire Resident

On or about August 7, 2020, Summit is providing written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes one (1) New Hampshire resident. A sample of the letter is attached hereto and labeled as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, Summit moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of Summit systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. Summit is also working to implement additional safeguards and training to its employees. Additionally, Summit is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. Summit is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud. Summit is also reporting this matter to other regulators as required.

Pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:19, et seq., the Latin School of Chicago, 59 W. North Blvd., Chicago, IL 60610 ("Latin"), through its attorneys Michael Best & Friedrich, LLP, 1 S. Pinckney St., Ste. 700, Madison, WI 53703 ("MBF"), is writing to notify you about a data security incident that occurred at Blackbaud, one of Latin's third party service providers. Latin is a private K-12 school located in Chicago, Illinois. It engages Blackbaud for various cloud services to help manage its philanthropy, alumni engagement, student billing, and internal fund management. Michael Szczepanek, Chief Financial Officer, mszczepanek@latinschool.org, (312) 582-6102, is Latin's contact, and Adrienne S. Ehrhardt, Partner, asehrhardt@michaelbest.com, (608) 283-0131, from MBF is Latin's legal counsel, assisting with the management of this incident. We believe that four (4) New Hampshire residents were among this group affected by this breach. Latin is providing these residents with 12 months of free credit monitoring and ID theft restoration through TransUnion.

On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified Latin that it suffered a ransomware attack in May 2020, which Blackbaud successfully stopped with the help of independent forensics experts and law enforcement. Unfortunately, the perpetrator was able to copy backups that contained data from Latin and many other schools, colleges, and nonprofits. Blackbaud did, however, pay the requested ransom to ensure the backup file was permanently destroyed. The personal information that may have been accessed included: names, addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security Numbers, and information relating to the individual's relationship with Latin, such as their philanthropic giving history. Blackbaud generally encrypts sensitive information such as Social Security Number, credit card numbers, or financial account information entered on its systems. However, Latin later discovered that Blackbaud does not encrypt uploaded forms to its systems that may contain such information, and it subsequently determined that some forms containing Social Security Numbers were uploaded to Blackbaud's systems. Blackbaud has informed Latin that there is no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal; was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

Re: Legal Notice of Information Security Incident

Sir or Madam:

I am writing to notify your office of a security incident involving 34 New Hampshire residents. The University of Florida Health (UF Health) has learned of a security incident involving one of its software-based products to maintain lists. On July 16, 2020, UF Health received notification from Blackbaud that they had discovered a cyberattack on one of their systems that stores information. The cyberattack occurred at some point beginning on February 7, 2020, and could have been in there intermittently until May 20, 2020, when it was first discovered by Blackbaud.

Once it discovered the attack, Blackbaud worked with law enforcement and an external investigator to research the incident. The cybercriminal demanded a ransom in exchange for an assurance that they would destroy the stolen data. Blackbaud paid the ransom and received confirmation that the data the cybercriminal removed from the Blackbaud system had been destroyed. Blackbaud has not disclosed the details about how the data were destroyed and what confirmation was received. Blackbaud has, however, shared that, based on their research and third-party (including both law enforcement and forensic security firms) investigations, they have no reason to believe that any data was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made publicly available.

UF does not use this system to store highly sensitive personal or clinical information. Our research into this incident has revealed that some personal information, including demographic information (such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses) was included. Additionally, dates of birth	The breach was a result of a cyberattack on a software-based product and the theft of personal information, indicating an outside party was responsible for the breach.

RE: Notice of Data Breach

Dear [Salutation]:

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. The Prostate Cancer Foundation takes the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. We are therefore contacting you to explain the incident and provide you with steps you can take to protect yourself.

What Happened

We were recently notified by one of our third-party service providers of a security incident. At this time, we understand they discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. After discovering the attack, the service provider's Cyber Security team together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking their system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from their system.

Prior to locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of our backup file containing your personal information. This occurred at some point beginning on February 7, 2020, and could have been in there intermittently until May 20, 2020.

What Information Was Involved

It's important to note that the cybercriminal did not access your credit card information, bank account information, or social security number. However, we have determined that the file removed may have contained your first and last name; contact information; email address; demographic information; a history of your relationship with our organization, such as donation dates and amounts; and information that you provided regarding a connection to prostate cancer.

Because protecting customers' data is their top priority, our third-party service provider paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy of our back-up file which the cybercriminal removed had been destroyed. Based on the nature of the incident, our vendor's research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, our vendor does not believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What We Are Doing

Notwithstanding our belief that the data breach was contained by our vendor, we are notifying you so that you can take action to protect yourself. Ensuring the safety of our constituents' data is of the utmost importance to us. As part of their ongoing efforts to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, the Prostate Cancer Foundation is reevaluating all third-party relationships which involve constituents' data and its internal data protection practices.

The Prostate Cancer Foundation wants to know procedures are in place to protect your data from any subsequent incidents. With respect to this incident, the affected third-party vendor assures us that they have identified and corrected the vulnerability exploited by the cybercriminal.

What You Can Do

Based on the information provided by our third-party vendor and our data collection practices, we do not believe your financial account, social security number, tax identification number, driver's license number, or credit card information or other information likely to lead to identity theft has been compromised. As a best practice, however, we recommend you remain vigilant, review your accounts, change your passwords and pins routinely, and periodically obtain a credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting agencies.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent the American Seating Company ("American Seating") located at 401 American Seating Center, Grand Rapids, MI 49504, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to three (3) New Hampshire residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, American Seating does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law, the applicability of the New Hampshire data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On January 29, 2020 American Seating became aware of suspicious activity relating to certain American Seating employee email accounts. In response, American Seating worked with third party forensic specialists to investigate the nature and scope of the activity. American Seating determined that two American Seating email accounts were accessed without authorization. The period of unauthorized access varied for each account at issue. Every potentially accessible email and attachment within the impacted accounts was reviewed to determine what information may have been accessible to the unauthorized actor.

Dear Attorney General Becerra:

Filters Fast, LLC (Filtersfast), a client of Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, LLP, is notifying the Office of the Attorney General that Filtersfast is notifying approximately 26,093 individuals who reside in California of a criminal cyber-attack on the Filtersfast website. This letter is being provided as a courtesy as we do not believe notification to you is required by your states statute.

In late February 2020, Filtersfast was made aware of a possible data security incident affecting its e-commerce website. Filtersfast immediately began investigating the potential issue. The investigation included hiring an outside expert forensics firm to analyze the Filtersfast systems and determine if there was a breach of security. On July 20, 2020, that investigation revealed that attackers had succeeded in adding malicious code to the Filtersfast website on July 15, 2019, which allowed unauthorized individuals to capture certain information during the checkout process. The malicious code was removed on July 10, 2020, during an unrelated update of the website, ending the unauthorized access.

The information potentially affected includes customer name, shipping and billing address, and payment card information used to make a purchase on the e-commerce site. Filtersfast is mailing notifications to all potentially affected customers in your state between August 14 and August 18, 2020. An example of the notification is attached.

While it is unlikely that this event will result in new account creation identity theft, Filtersfast is offering each potentially affected customer a one-year subscription to identity theft protection services through ID Experts, focused on identifying or remediating existing account fraud that might impact payment card accounts involved. Services include 12 months of credit and CybserScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed ID theft recovery services. Information regarding these services, as well as additional information to assist customers, is included in the notification sent to the customer.

If you would like additional information concerning the above, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

Joshua James	The information captured, including payment card information, was accomplished through the use of malicious code added to the website by unauthorized individuals.
Insufficient information	There is no information available about the nature of the breach from the given description.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear Ivan Ramrirez,

Metropolitan Community College of Kansas City (MCCKC) takes seriously the privacy and security of its students and employees, and therefore wanted to timely release information regarding a data privacy incident involving name, Social Security number, drivers license number, medical information and bank account information. Although we are not aware of any misuse of individual information, it is important to us that we provide information regarding this matter.

What happened?

On June 19, 2020, MCCKC determined that your information may have been available to an unauthorized party due to a ransomware attack that resulted in certain data being encrypted. Following the incident, MCCKC immediately engaged a third party to conduct a forensic investigation with the objective of identifying the potential scope of access the threat actor may have had to the environment during the period of unauthorized access, which included arriving at a determination as to whether sensitive personal data was accessed by an unauthorized third party. The forensic investigation was recently completed and determined that an unauthorized individual may have had access to the MCCKC environment. The forensic investigation did not conclude or preclude that data was extracted from MCCKCs systems however, it is possible that certain personal data, including names, Social Security numbers, drivers license information and medical information of former, prospective, and current students could have been accessed by an unauthorized party. The investigation further acknowledged that the names, Social Security numbers and bank account information of employees could have been accessible as well, however, there is no evidence that any personal information was extracted from MCCs systems or subject to actual or attempted misuse. Although the investigation did not find any specific access to any individuals information and MCCKC has no indication that data has been extracted from MCCKCs systems or misused, we have chosen to notify all potentially impacted parties of this incident out of an abundance of caution and in full transparency.

What we are doing?

Following confirmation that an unauthorized individual did gain access to the MCCKC network, MCCKC immediately sought to identify the population of potentially impacted individuals. Privacy of data is a top priority for MCCKC and due to our security posture, MCCKC did not lose access to its systems, backup systems, or other operational data. However, in an abundance of caution, MCCKC has implemented additional safeguards to further secure system information. As a precaution, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for one year provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. This service includes Credit Monitoring, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration.

To enroll in this service, go to the myTrueIdentity website at www.MyTrueIdentity.com and, in the space referenced as Enter Activation Code, enter the 12-letter Activation Code FDKVKNZCKZHN and follow the three steps to receive your credit monitoring service online within minutes.

When prompted, enter the six-digit telephone passcode 698641 and follow the steps to enroll in the offline credit monitoring service, add an initial fraud alert to your credit file, or to speak to a TransUnion representative if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft. You can sign up for the online or offline credit monitoring service anytime between now and November 30, 2020. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. Please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with TransUnion or an address in the United States (or its territories) and a valid Social Security number. Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

The service also includes access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event that your identity is compromised and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (Policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

What you can do.

Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information

Monitor Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report. You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law,	This data breach notification letter describes a ransomware attack that resulted in certain data being encrypted and that an unauthorized individual may have had access to the environment with sensitive personal data potentially being accessed. The organization also hired a third party to conduct a forensic investigation with a determination that certain personal data of students and employees could have been accessed.

Notice of Breach

We are writing to inform you about a recent email incident that may have exposed some personal information maintained by NRI USA, LLC (NRI) to unauthorized access. After conducting an investigation, we discovered that some personal information that we maintained about a small number of our employees may have been accessed without authorization. We take this matter very seriously because we know how important your personal information is to you. At this time, we have no indication that any of this personal information has been inappropriately used by anyone. We are providing this notice to you as a precautionary measure, to inform you and to explain steps that you can take to help protect your information.

What happened:

On October 15, 2019, we learned that an unauthorized individual attempted to use one of our corporate email addresses to misdirect a payment intended for NRI. We immediately began an investigation and, based on the available evidence, determined that there had been unauthorized access to two (2) corporate email accounts between September 3, 2019, and October 23, 2019. Our investigation showed that the email accounts were used by employees from NRI and our related companies. On October 24, 2019, we determined that your personal information may have been accessed.

What information was involved:

The investigation revealed that in the process of obtaining information to misdirect the payment, the malicious actor may have accessed personal information in the email accounts. For this reason and because we could not identify what specific information was accessed, we reviewed the entire contents of each employee's email boxes to find out what was in each email, who may have been affected, and where those people resided. That information may have included your <<b2b_text_1 (Impacted Data)>>.

What you can do:

Although we are unaware of any misuse of your or anyone's information, to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring, at no cost to you, for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.

1. Adding two-factor authentication for remote access to Office 365 services, including email;

In addition, we are taking steps to mitigate any potential misuse of your information by offering you identity monitoring services and providing notice of this incident to appropriate regulators.

The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, MCCKC does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

Following the incident, MCCKC immediately engaged a third party to conduct a forensic investigation with the objective of identifying the potential scope of access the threat actor may have had to the environment during the period of unauthorized access, which included arriving at a determination as to whether sensitive personal data was accessed by an unauthorized third party.

The forensic investigation was recently completed and determined that an unauthorized individual may have had access to the MCCKC environment. The forensic investigation did not conclude or preclude that data was extracted from MCCKCs systems however, it is possible that certain personal data, including names, Social Security numbers, drivers license information and medical information of former, prospective, and current students could have been accessed by an unauthorized party. The investigation further determined that the names, Social Security numbers and bank account information of employees could have been accessible as well, however, there is no evidence that any personal information was extracted from MCCKCs systems or subject to actual or attempted misuse.

Although the investigation did not find any specific access to any individuals information and MCCKC has no indication that data has been extracted from MCCKCs systems or misused, MCCKC has chosen to notify all potentially impacted parties of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

3. Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File.

If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a security freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by sending a request in writing or by mail, to all three nationwide credit reporting companies. To find out more about how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information:

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

Filters Fast, LLC (Filtersfast), a client of Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, LLP, is notifying the Office of the Attorney General that Filtersfast is notifying approximately 2,286 individuals who reside in New Hampshire of a criminal cyber-attack on the Filtersfast website. This letter is being provided as a courtesy as we do not believe notification to you is required by your state's statute.

In late February 2020, Filtersfast was made aware of a possible data security incident affecting its e-commerce website. Filtersfast immediately began investigating the potential issue. The investigation included hiring an outside expert forensics firm to analyze the Filtersfast systems and determine if there was a breach of security.

On July 20, 2020, that investigation revealed that attackers had succeeded in adding malicious code to the Filtersfast website on July 15, 2019, which allowed unauthorized individuals to capture certain information during the checkout process. The malicious code was removed on July 10, 2020, during an unrelated update of the website, ending the unauthorized access.

The information potentially affected includes customer name, shipping and billing address, and payment card information used to make a purchase on the e-commerce site. Filtersfast is mailing notifications to all potentially affected customers in your state between August 14 and August 18, 2020. An example of the notification is attached.

While it is unlikely that this event will result in new account creation identity theft, Filtersfast is offering each potentially affected customer a one-year subscription to identity theft protection services through ID Experts, focused on identifying or remediating existing account fraud that might impact payment card accounts involved. Services include 12 months of credit and CybserScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed ID theft recovery services. Information regarding these services, as well as additional information to assist customers, is included in the notification sent to the customer.

If you would like additional information concerning the above, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

Joshua James

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

Our law firm represents The City of Athens, Ohio ("Athens"), a public municipality within the state of Ohio. We are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of certain personal information relating to ten (10) New Hampshire residents. This notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Athens does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law, the applicability of the New Hampshire data event notification statute, its status as a sovereign public entity, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On February 7, 2020, The City of Athens became aware of suspicious activity on one of its computer servers and discovered it was unable to access certain files on that server. Athens immediately secured the server and launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party computer forensic specialists. The investigation determined that although there was no evidence of unauthorized access to sensitive information within Athens' tax, finance, and payroll systems, that type of activity could not be ruled out with absolute certainty.

Athens then undertook a lengthy and labor-intensive process to identify the individuals whose information may have been included in the impacted server. That process was completed on July 2, 2020. Athens is providing notice to individuals whose information may have been impacted by the event. The type of information related to the affected New Hampshire residents includes the following: name, mailing address, and Social Security number.

Notice to New Hampshire Residents

On August 12, 2020, Athens began providing written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes ten (10) New Hampshire residents. A sample of the letter is attached hereto and labeled as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, Athens moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of Athens systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. Athens is also working to implement additional safeguards and training to its employees.

Athens is providing affected individuals whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident with access to one (1) year of credit monitoring services through TransUnion at no cost to these individuals. Additionally, Athens is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank.

Athens is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Athens is also reporting this matter to other regulators as required.

Contact Information

Should you have any questions regarding this notification or other aspects of the data security event, please contact us at 267-930-4842.

Pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:19, et seq., the Latin School of Chicago, 59 W. North Blvd., Chicago, IL 60610 ("Latin"), through its attorneys Michael Best & Friedrich, LLP, 1 S. Pinckney St., Ste. 700, Madison, WI 53703 ("MBF"), is writing to notify you about a data security incident that occurred at Blackbaud, one of Latin's third party service providers.

Latin is a private K-12 school located in Chicago, Illinois. It engages Blackbaud for various cloud services to help manage its philanthropy, alumni engagement, student billing, and internal fund management. Michael Szczepanek, Chief Financial Officer, mszczepanek@latinschool.org, (312) 582-6102, is Latin's contact, and Adrienne S. Ehrhardt, Partner, asehrhardt@michaelbest.com, (608) 283-0131, from MBF is Latin's legal counsel, assisting with the management of this incident.

We believe that four (4) New Hampshire residents were among this group affected by this breach. Latin is providing these residents with 12 months of free credit monitoring and ID theft restoration through TransUnion.

On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified Latin that it suffered a ransomware attack in May 2020, which Blackbaud successfully stopped with the help of independent forensics experts and law enforcement. Unfortunately, the perpetrator was able to copy backups that contained data from Latin and many other schools, colleges, and nonprofits. Blackbaud did, however, pay the requested ransom to ensure the backup file was permanently destroyed.

The personal information that may have been accessed included: names, addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security Numbers, and information relating to the individual's relationship with Latin, such as their philanthropic giving history. Blackbaud generally encrypts sensitive information such as Social Security Number, credit card numbers, or financial account information entered on its systems. However, Latin later discovered that Blackbaud does not encrypt uploaded forms to its systems that may contain such information, and it subsequently determined that some forms containing Social Security Numbers were uploaded to Blackbaud's systems.

Blackbaud has informed Latin that there is no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal; was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

Blackbaud is working with third party cybersecurity experts and law enforcement to monitor the internet to assist in determining that the information relating to this incident was destroyed. It identified the vulnerability associated with this incident and quickly implemented a security fix. Blackbaud has confirmed through testing by multiple third parties that their fix is able to withstand all currently known cyberattacks. As part of its ongoing efforts to help prevent an incident like this in the future, Blackbaud has implemented additional safety protocols that will help to protect its data. Additionally, Blackbaud is accelerating efforts to enhance access management, backups, encryption, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

Attached is a copy of the notification letters that Latin will place in the U.S. Mail Tuesday, August 18, 2020, to the affected individuals. There was no delay in providing individual notification as a result of law enforcement investigation.

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

McDonald Hopkins PLC represents Dent Wizard International ("Dent Wizard"). I am writing to provide notification of an incident at Dent Wizard that may affect the security of personal information of approximately seventy-seven (77) New Hampshire residents. Dent Wizard's investigation is ongoing, and this notification will be supplemented with any new or significant facts or findings subsequent to this submission, if any. By providing this notice, Dent Wizard does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law or personal jurisdiction.

Dent Wizard learned that an unauthorized party may have obtained access to a limited number of Dent Wizard employees' email accounts as a result of an email phishing incident. Upon learning of the issue, Dent Wizard secured the accounts and commenced a prompt and thorough investigation. As part of its investigation, Dent Wizard has worked very closely with external cybersecurity professionals who regularly investigate and analyze these types of situations to analyze the extent of any compromise of the email accounts and the security of the emails and attachments contained within them.

Dent Wizard devoted considerable time and effort to determine what information was contained in the affected email accounts. Based on its extensive forensic investigation and manual email review, Dent Wizard determined on July 22, 2020, that the impacted email accounts that were accessed on or around January 22, 2020, to February 4, 2020, contained a limited amount of personal information, including the affected residents' full names and one (1) or more of the following: Social Security number and driver's license number. Dent Wizard has no indication that any information has been misused.

Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, Dent Wizard wanted to inform you (and the affected residents) of the incident and to explain the steps that it is taking to help safeguard the impacted residents against identity fraud.

As such, we wanted to provide you with information about the incident, explain the services we are making available to you, and let you know that we continue to take significant measures to protect your information.

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that occurred at Blackbaud, a third-party vendor that provides software and services for fundraising and alumni/donor engagement efforts at non-profits and universities worldwide, including the University of Detroit Mercy (Detroit Mercy).

On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified Detroit Mercy of a ransomware attack on their internal systems. Upon learning of the issue, we immediately launched an investigation and engaged external cybersecurity professionals experienced in handling these types of incidents. Blackbaud reported that they identified an attempted ransomware attack in progress on May 20, 2020. Forensic experts and law enforcement were engaged to assist in their internal investigation. The investigation concluded that the cybercriminal removed data from Blackbaud's systems intermittently between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020. A backup file containing certain information was removed by the cybercriminal. Blackbaud paid the cybercriminal to ensure that the backup file was permanently destroyed.

On July 31, 2020, we determined that the information removed by the threat actor may have contained your full name and Social Security number. However, the threat actor did not access your payment card information or bank account information because Detroit Mercy does not store this information in the Blackbaud database.

Blackbaud has taken swift action to fix the vulnerability associated with this incident and is accelerating its efforts to further harden its environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

To protect you from potential misuse of your information, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of Experian IdentityWorks Credit 3B. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorks Credit 3B is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not impact your credit score.

We recommend that you place an initial 1-year fraud alert on your credit files, at no charge, even if you choose not to use the complimentary 12-month credit monitoring services. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you personally before they open any new accounts. You may also consider placing a security freeze on your credit file, which prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization.

Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the three major nationwide credit reporting companies. We encourage you to review your credit reports for discrepancies and to check them periodically for suspicious activity.

We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may cause you and remain fully committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information in our possession. If you have any further questions regarding this incident, please call our dedicated and confidential toll-free response line at [phone number]. The response line is staffed with professionals familiar with this incident and knowledgeable on what you can do to protect against misuse of your information.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Patriot Growth Insurance Services, LLC ("Patriot") located at 501 Office Center Drive, Suite 215, Ft. Washington, PA 19034 and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to one (1) New Hampshire resident. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Patriot does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law, the applicability of the New Hampshire data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

Patriot is an insurance services firm that acquired Voluntary Benefit Specialists, LLC ("VBS") in January of 2019. VBS is a voluntary employee benefits consulting and brokerage firm for employers. In connection with providing these services, VBS receives certain personal information from employers in order to enroll employees in voluntary benefit plans being offered by the employer.

On January 7, 2020, VBS discovered suspicious activity in a VBS employee's email account. VBS immediately took steps to secure the employee's email account and launched an investigation. This investigation included working with a third-party forensic investigator to determine the nature and scope of the activity.

On January 17, 2020, VBS' investigation determined that two (2) VBS employee email accounts had their account credentials used by an unknown actor(s) to gain unauthorized access to each of the accounts. Although the investigation confirmed the unauthorized actor(s) gained access on separate occasions to one account between December 23, 2019, and January 13, 2020, and the second account between January 6, 2020, and January 7, 2020, VBS cannot rule out the possibility of the unauthorized actor(s) gaining access to any specific email or attachment in the affected accounts.

With the assistance of third-party forensics, on March 4, 2020, VBS completed a programmatic and manual review of the contents of the email accounts to determine the types of protected information contained in the emails and to which individuals the information relates, and immediately launched a review of its files to ascertain address information for the clients of the impacted individuals.

The information that could have been subject to unauthorized access includes name, date of birth, Social Security number, medical information, and/or insurance information.

On or about May 26, 2020, VBS notified each impacted client of this incident and is providing notice to impacted individuals on its clients' behalf.

Notice to New Hampshire Resident

On or about August 12, 2020, VBS began providing written notice of this incident to affected individuals, which includes one (1) New Hampshire resident. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, Patriot and VBS moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, including resetting the affected email account passwords, assessing the security of VBS' systems, and notifying potentially affected clients and individuals. Patriot is also working to implement additional safeguards and training to its employees, including VBS employees.

While Patriot and VBS are not aware of any attempted or actual misuse of personal information, it is providing impacted individuals with access to credit monitoring and identity restoration services for twelve (12) months, through TransUnion, at no cost to these individuals. Additionally, VBS is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

We are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident involving D&S Residential Holdings, LLC ("D&S"), 8911 N. Capital of Texas Hwy, Bldg. 1, Ste. 1300, Austin, TX 78759. D&S recently learned that an unauthorized party gained access to a few employee email accounts through a phishing attack. D&S immediately initiated an investigation and retained a leading computer security firm. During the course of the investigation, we learned that unauthorized connections were made to a limited number of D&S email accounts between April 20, 2020, and June 15, 2020. We were unable to confirm whether any specific emails or attachments stored within those affected accounts were viewed or acquired as a result of this incident.

Out of an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails stored in the affected email accounts to determine whether any of those emails contained personal information. Based on this investigation, D&S determined that the social security number of one New Hampshire resident was present in an email account involved in this incident. As a precaution, D&S has arranged to provide an Experian Identityworks membership to this New Hampshire resident to protect their identity for 12 months at no cost.

More information regarding this matter is described in the enclosed sample notification letter. The notification letter is being printed now and will be sent via postal mail directly to the affected New Hampshire resident on August 14, 2020.

Please contact us with any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Christopher L. Ingram

Dear Attorney General MacDonald:

I represent NAFSA: Association of International Educators (NAFSA) located in Washington, DC. This letter is being sent pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:19 - C:21 because NAFSA has determined that the personal information of six (6) New Hampshire residents may have been involved in a data security incident. The information which may have been involved included names, card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.

NAFSA maintains an online store (https://shop.nafsa.org/), through which members can make purchases and register for events. Upon learning of potential unauthorized activity occurring in the online store, NAFSA took immediate steps to secure its system and conducted an internal investigation. NAFSA also worked with a leading forensics firm to determine what happened as well as whether, and to what extent, the payment card information of NAFSAs customers had been affected.

On July 16, 2020, NAFSAs investigation determined that the incident involved the payment card information of NAFSA customers who made purchases through the online store between April 8, 2020 and May 15, 2020. On August 12, 2020, NAFSA confirmed that the affected individuals include six (6) New Hampshire residents.

NAFSA has reported the incident to the payment card brands and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to protect the affected individuals payment card information and prevent fraudulent activity.

Re: Notice of Data Security Incident

To the New Hampshire Office of the Attorney General:

We represent First Pacific Advisors, LP (FPA) and write to notify you about an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to two New Hampshire residents, as further described below.

FPA is a Los Angeles-based investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission located at 11601 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90025. We write to inform you of the nature of the incident and to explain the steps that FPA is taking to address the incident, including notifying potentially impacted individuals and identifying ways to help them protect their personal information.

Nature of the Incident

FPA recently determined that two employee email accounts were temporarily accessed by an unauthorized third party who sent a phishing email that impersonated a company service provider. Upon learning of the situation, FPA promptly contained the incident by securing the email accounts, immediately took remedial actions and launched an investigation with the assistance of an independent expert computer forensics firm. The investigation determined that between May 2, 2020 and May 5, 2020, the two email accounts were accessed by a third party without authorization.

After performing a thorough review to determine who and what information was affected and completing the investigation on or around July 21, 2020, we concluded that the incident did not extend beyond the two email accounts. As part of the investigation, it was concluded that one or more of the following types of personal information were present in the two affected email accounts at the time of the incident: name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security number, and employee health insurance information.

There is no evidence that the unauthorized third party viewed the personal information. However, as a precaution, we are nonetheless notifying this Office and the individual state residents, including providing them with complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for 24 months.

Residents Notified

FPA has identified those affected individuals who are residents in your state and the personal information of such residents that was present in the two email accounts, and FPA intends to provide notice of the incident to two New Hampshire residents on or about August 20, 2020. An unaddressed copy of the individual notification letter is attached.

Steps Taken Relating to the Incident

After learning about the incident, FPA quickly took steps to confirm the security of its systems, including all of its employee email accounts. FPA immediately reset the passwords for the affected email accounts, and required all other employees not affected by the incident to reset their passwords. FPA has been implementing additional safeguards designed to protect its network and has increased the intensity of its phishing testing, including targeted training. FPA also contacted federal and state authorities.

In addition, FPA is providing a telephone number for individuals to call with any questions they may have.

By providing this notice, FPA does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of New Hampshire law, personal jurisdiction or other related rights.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 765-9505 or nkohne@akingump.com if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

Natasha G. Kohne

Subject: [External] Notification of Blackbaud Data Incident

From: Santa Rosa Junior College Foundation

To: Laggos, Sarah

Dear Sarah,

We take the trust of our community members seriously and are committed to protecting their personal information. We are writing to inform you that Blackbaud, the database software provider we use to maintain alumni, community member, and donor information, experienced a ransomware attack. Although Blackbaud does not believe that your information was misused in any way, we want to inform you about this incident and the steps we are taking.

What happened?

Blackbaud is one of the world's largest software providers to universities, schools, charities, and other nonprofit organizations and offers data management services for the SRJC Foundation. On August 6, 2020, Blackbaud confirmed that in May 2020, they had discovered and stopped a ransomware attack on their computer systems, and SRJC Foundation data was compromised.

To protect against further compromise of customers' data and to mitigate potential identity theft, Blackbaud met the cybercriminal's ransomware demand. Blackbaud reports they received confirmation that the cybercriminal destroyed the copied data in exchange for the ransomware payment.

Blackbaud stated that they "have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly." They base this on the type of incident, their research, and the involvement of law enforcement and cybersecurity experts. In addition, Blackbaud hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web as an extra precautionary measure.

What information was involved?

The cybercriminal did not access your credit card information, bank account information, or social security number. Notably, the SRJC Foundation does not store that information in the Blackbaud database (or anywhere else). However, we have determined that the file removed may have contained your contact information, employer information, gender and date of birth, spouse's identity, and a history of your relationship with our organization, such as event participation and record of giving.

What are we doing about the situation?

We are continuing to take measures to understand the full scope of this attack and to protect the personal information of our community members. We believe it is important to inform our community of the Blackbaud incident so we can all stay vigilant as we seek additional information from Blackbaud regarding:

- Why there was a delay between incident discovery and notification to all those affected
- Why they're confident the cybercriminals won't misuse or disseminate the data they seized
- The additional security measures they've put in place since the incident and any additional measures they plan to implement

What you can do

We want to emphasize again that no credit card, bank account, or other information of that nature was compromised because the SRJC Foundation does not store that information in the Blackbaud database. However, as a best practice, data security experts recommend that individuals remain vigilant by reviewing their account statements and credit reports closely and reporting any suspicious activities. For example:

- If you receive unsolicited requests for donations from us or other nonprofits, please call the number on the organization's website to confirm the legitimacy of the solicitation.
- Obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com.
- If you detect any suspicious activity, promptly notify the financial institution or company where the account is maintained. You should also report any fraudulent activity or suspected incidence of identity theft to law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Metropolitan Community College of Kansas City ("MCCKC"), located at 3200 Broadway Blvd., Kansas City, MO 64111, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to thirty-four (34) New Hampshire residents.

On June 19, 2020, MCCKC determined that student and employee information may have been available to an unauthorized party due to a ransomware attack that resulted in certain data being encrypted. Following the incident, MCCKC immediately engaged a third party to conduct a forensic investigation with the objective of identifying the potential scope of access the threat actor may have had to the environment during the period of unauthorized access, which included arriving at a determination as to whether sensitive personal data was accessed by an unauthorized third party.

The forensic investigation was recently completed and determined that an unauthorized individual may have had access to the MCCKC environment. The forensic investigation did not conclude or preclude that data was extracted from MCCKC's systems however, it is possible that certain personal data, including names, Social Security numbers, drivers' license information and medical information of former, prospective, and current students could have been accessed by an unauthorized party. The investigation further determined that the names, Social Security numbers and bank account information of employees could have been accessible as well, however, there is no evidence that any personal information was extracted from MCCKC's systems or subject to actual or attempted misuse.

Although the investigation did not find any specific access to any individual's information and MCCKC has no indication that data has been extracted from MCCKC's systems or misused, MCCKC has chosen to notify all potentially impacted parties of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

On or about August 14, 2020, MCCKC provided written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes thirty-four (34) New Hampshire residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the email attached here as Exhibit A.

Following confirmation that an unauthorized individual did gain access to the MCCKC network, MCCKC immediately sought to identify the population of potentially impacted individuals.

RE: Notice of Data Breach

Dear [Customer Name],

We are writing on behalf of Dave, Inc. (Dave) to inform you about a cybersecurity incident affecting certain personal information. We value our relationship with you and take data protection and privacy issues seriously. This notification provides you with information about the incident and outlines additional steps you may take to help protect yourself.

What Happened?

As a result of a breach at a former third-party service provider, an unauthorized party illegally accessed and stole certain customer data at Dave between June 23 and July 1, 2020. As soon as we became aware of this incident on July 1, 2020, our security team quickly took steps to secure our systems including our customers' accounts. We immediately began an investigation, retained a leading cybersecurity firm, and notified law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). After the compromise at Dave's service provider, the unauthorized party was able to gain temporary access to Dave's systems and obtained certain Dave customer data. It appears this data is now posted online as available for sale on, or download from, illicit online marketplaces, which the FBI is aware of and is investigating. You are receiving this notice because we determined that your records are among those that may have been impacted.

What Information Was Involved?

The types of data that may have been exposed as a result of this incident included the following. However, not every customer had every data element exposed:

- First and last name
- Gender
- Email
- Profile image
- Phone
- Hashed password
- Date of birth
- Encrypted Social Security number
- Physical address
- Customer application preferences (e.g., notification frequency, default tip percentage, etc.)

Importantly, the breach did not affect bank account numbers, credit card numbers, or records of financial transactions. Dave has no evidence of fraudulent customer account usage or that any customer has experienced any financial loss as a result of this incident. We also have no evidence to indicate the unauthorized party accessed the encryption keys used to encrypt your Social Security number. Social Security numbers were encrypted using AES-256 encryption and customer passwords were stored in illegible form using bcrypt, an industry-recognized hashing algorithm. We subsequently confirmed, however, the likelihood that a party was able to	The unauthorized party illegally accessed and stole certain customer data, indicating that this was a hack by an outside party.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear << Name 1 >>:

We value and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing on behalf of Saint Lukes Foundation (SLF) to inform you of a recent security incident involving one of our third-party vendors that may have affected some of your information and share some steps that you can take to help protect yourself. SLF is a non-profit organization and affiliated foundation of Saint Lukes Health System (SLHS).

WHAT HAPPENED?

On July 16, 2020, we were notified by one of our third-party vendors, Blackbaud, that it had experienced a security incident potentially involving certain limited information it obtained from SLF. Blackbaud is a widely used constituent relationship management software provider for engagement and fundraising offices in higher education and nonprofits. Blackbaud informed us that it discovered and stopped a ransomware attack, but not before some information may have been compromised. According to information provided to us by Blackbaud, the cybercriminal removed a copy of our backup file for the purpose of extorting funds from Blackbaud. Blackbaud stated that the ransomware attack and data compromise occurred at some point between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020. Based on the nature of the incident, their research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, Blackbaud has assured us that it has no reason to believe that any data went beyond this cybercriminal or was disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Blackbaud further stated that they have taken additional steps to ensure that the backup file was permanently deleted.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

Blackbaud has informed us that the cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information or social security numbers, as this information was encrypted and stored in a separate backup system from what was compromised. Blackbaud has also informed us that the compromised backup file may have contained some of your patient demographic and guarantor information, such as name, mailing address, and telephone number as well as your email address and date of birth, and possibly limited medical information about you, such as date of service and department of care.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

As part of its ongoing efforts to help avoid an event like this from happening in the future, Blackbaud has affirmed to SLF that it has already implemented changes to help protect its system from any subsequent incidents. Since learning of the issue, Blackbaud identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and has taken actions to fix it. Additionally, Blackbaud is accelerating their efforts to further harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint, and network-based platforms. As an additional precautionary measure, Blackbaud has indicated that it has hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web for any further misuse of the data.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

Please review the enclosed Other Important Information document included with this letter for further steps you can take to protect your information, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file. Although no Social Security numbers or financial account information were involved, as best practice, we recommend you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your credit reports for unauthorized activity.

FOR MORE INFORMATION

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at between 8 a.m. 8 p.m. Central Time, Monday through Friday. Additional information about this incident can be found at https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident.

RE: Data Security Incident Notice

Dear Office of the Attorney General:

My law firm represents Dave, Inc. ("Dave"). Pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. 359-C:20, I am writing to notify you of a data security incident at Dave involving approximately 4,806 residents of New Hampshire.

NATURE OF THE DATA SECURITY INCIDENT

As a result of a breach at a former third-party service provider, an unauthorized party illegally accessed and stole certain customer data at Dave between June 23 and July 1, 2020. As soon as Dave became aware of this incident on July 1, 2020, Dave's security team quickly took steps to secure the company's systems, including its customers' accounts. Dave immediately began an investigation, retained a leading cybersecurity firm, and notified law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

After the compromise at Dave's service provider, the unauthorized party was able to gain temporary access to Dave's systems and obtained certain Dave customer data. It appears this data is now posted online as available for sale on, or download from, illicit online marketplaces, which the FBI is aware of and is investigating.

The types of data that may have been exposed as a result of this incident included the following. However, not every customer had every data element exposed:

- First and last name
- Email
- Phone
- Date of birth
- Physical address
- Gender
- Profile image
- Customer application preferences (e.g., notification frequency, default tip percentage, etc.)
- Hashed password
- Encrypted Social Security number

Importantly, the breach did not affect bank account numbers, credit card numbers, or records of financial transactions. Dave has no evidence of fraudulent customer account usage or that any customer has experienced any financial loss as a result of this incident. Dave also has no evidence to indicate the unauthorized party accessed the encryption keys used to encrypt Social Security numbers. Social Security numbers were encrypted using encryption and customer passwords were stored in illegible form using bcrypt, an industry-recognized hashing algorithm. Dave subsequently confirmed the likelihood that a party was able to crack or determine the plain text characters of at least some of the stolen hashed passwords.

REMEDIAL STEPS

Dave is no longer working with the third-party service provider whose security breach enabled the unauthorized party to ultimately obtain Dave's customer data. Moreover, upon Dave's discovery of the incident, Dave's security team quickly took steps to secure the company's systems, including its customers' accounts. Dave retained a leading cybersecurity company to investigate and to provide remediation recommendations. Dave has forced a reset of all customer login credentials and is requiring all customers to change their passwords. When logging in, customers will receive instructions on how to change their password, which they should do immediately. Dave is also advising customers to change passwords on any other sites where they used the password they had previously used with Dave. Dave's security team has also put in place additional technical measures to enhance account security, in consultation with independent cybersecurity experts, which will provide additional layers of security and protection.

NOTIFICATION TO AFFECTED NEW HAMPSHIRE RESIDENTS

Notices to the approximately 4,806 New Hampshire residents whose personal information was compromised will be sent beginning tomorrow based on available contact information, by email as authorized, or via U.S. mail. In addition, the company is posting information about the incident on its website and major social media platforms, as well as to major statewide print and broadcast media. Dave has made arrangements for potentially affected customers to receive complimentary identity theft protection services through December 31, 2021. Additional information and instructions for enrolling in the identity theft protection services are included in the notification made to the affected parties.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Heifer Project International (Heifer International) located at 1 World Avenue, Little Rock, Arkansas 72202, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to six thousand three hundred thirteen (6,313) Iowa residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Heifer International does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On or about July 16, 2020, Heifer International received notification from one of its third-party vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud), of a cyber incident. Blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to organizations, including Heifer. Upon receiving notice of the cyber incident, Heifer International immediately commenced an investigation to better understand the nature and scope of the incident and any impact on Heifer International data.

On or about July 22, 2020, Heifer received further information from Blackbaud that allowed it to determine the information potentially affected may have contained personal information. Blackbaud reported that in May 2020, it experienced a ransomware incident that resulted in encryption of certain Blackbaud systems. Blackbaud reported the incident to law enforcement and worked with forensic investigators to investigate. Following its investigation, Blackbaud notified its customers that an unknown actor may have accessed or acquired certain Blackbaud customer data. Blackbaud reported that data was exfiltrated by the unknown actor at some point before Blackbaud locked the unknown actor out of the environment on May 20, 2020.

Upon learning of the Blackbaud incident, Heifer International immediately began to determine what, if any, sensitive Heifer International data was potentially involved. Our investigation determined that the involved Blackbaud system contained personal information, including names, drivers license number, and financial account number.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On or about Friday, August 21, 2020, Heifer International provided written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes six thousand three hundred thirteen (6,313) Iowa residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon discovering the event, Heifer International moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of Heifer International systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. Heifer International is also working to implement additional safeguards and training to its employees. Additionally, Heifer International is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank.

Heifer International is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, information on protecting against tax fraud, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law	Heifer Project International experienced a ransomware incident from one of its third-party vendors Blackbaud and personal information such as names, drivers license number, and financial account number of Iowa resident was potentially accessed.

ArbiterSports is committed to protecting the confidentiality of our customers' information. We are writing to notify you that we recently identified and addressed a data security incident that involved some of your information. This notice provides you with a description of the incident, our response, and the steps you may take.

What Happened?

We recently detected unauthorized access to certain devices in our network and an attempt to encrypt our systems. We immediately took measures to stop the access, launched an investigation, and a security firm was engaged. On July 15, 2020, findings from the investigation identified a backup copy of a database made for business continuity reasons that was obtained by the unauthorized party at some point in the prior few weeks. Although we were able to prevent devices from being encrypted, the unauthorized party demanded payment in exchange for deleting the files that were obtained. We reached an agreement and obtained confirmation that the unauthorized party deleted the files.

What Information Was Involved?

The database file involved supports ArbiterGame, ArbiterOne, and ArbiterWorks and contained information about our users, including account username and password, name, address, date of birth, email address, and Social Security number. The passwords and Social Security numbers were encrypted in the file, but the unauthorized party was able to decrypt the data.

What We Are Doing.

We have implemented additional measures and changes to enhance the security of our network. We also notified law enforcement and are supporting their investigation.

What You Can Do.

Westcor Land Title Insurance Company (Westcor) is writing to inform you of a recent event that may have impacted the security of certain personal information related to you. We are providing you with information about the event, steps taken since discovering the event, and what you can do to better protect against potential misuse of your information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On January 12, 2020, Westcor became aware of unusual activity on its network. Westcor conducted an immediate investigation and determined that the network was partially impacted by malware. Third-party forensic investigators were engaged to assist in the investigation to determine the nature and scope of the event and identify what personal information may have been impacted by this event.

Through the investigation, Westcor identified a database containing sensitive information that was accessed by the unauthorized individual(s) during this event. The database contained individuals' names and certain data relating to those individuals. However, the names were not easily associated with the data relating to those individuals. To match the individual with any associated data, particular tools and a specialized understanding of the database is required. As such, Westcor began an extensive review of its records to properly identify the addresses and associated data for the affected individuals. This review concluded on July 10, 2020.

What Information Was Involved?

The following information about you was included in the impacted database: your name, EXTRA1 ITEM1, ITEM2, ETC. While the data relating to you was not readily associated with your name, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution.

What We Are Doing.

Westcor is committed to, and takes very seriously, its responsibility to protect all data entrusted to us. As part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy of personal information in our care, we reviewed our existing policies and procedures and are working to implement additional safeguards to further secure the information contained within our network. Westcor is also notifying regulatory authorities, as required by law.

As an added precaution, we are also offering twelve (12) months of complimentary access to credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration services through Experian's IdentityWorksSM. Individuals who wish to receive these services must enroll by following the attached enrollment instructions.

What You Can Do.

You can review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Personal Information. You can also enroll to receive the complimentary services being offered to you.

For More Information.

We understand that you may have questions or concerns that are not addressed in this letter. Please call the dedicated assistance line that we have established regarding this incident by dialing (877) 659-0604 Monday through Friday from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm PST, Saturday and Sunday from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm PST, excluding U.S. holidays.

Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Breach

On behalf of Brown-Forman, we are writing to inform you about a recent cyber attack that involved personal information housed on the Brown-Forman network. We want to be sure you are aware of the actions the company is taking, what actions you can take to keep your data as secure as possible, and recommendations on how to monitor your personal information. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident may cause you and know that it comes at an already difficult time.

WHAT HAPPENED

On July 28, 2020, we discovered suspicious activity in our internal network and promptly began to investigate and contain it. On August 4, 2020, we learned the cybercriminals stole certain records containing information about some of our current and former employees. In some cases, these records contained limited information about employee dependents or beneficiaries. Out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this letter to all current employees of Brown-Forman as well as former employees who worked at Brown-Forman as of 2013 to alert them of this incident. We will notify you separately if your beneficiaries or dependents were impacted.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED

We believe the incident involved information regarding current and former employees, as well as certain beneficiaries and dependents of those employees. This includes information such as names, Social Security Numbers, work contact information (such as Brown-Forman email address), home address, position, business title, and salary-related information (such as base pay, hire date, and weekly hours worked).

WHAT WE ARE DOING

We began investigating the incident as soon as we became aware of suspicious activity on our network. We took several steps to limit access to our network to prevent further data from being compromised or stolen, engaged outside forensic experts to help us better understand the impact of this incident, and are cooperating with law enforcement.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

We are providing you with the following information about general steps that you can take to protect against potential misuse of personal information. Please remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft, including by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions.

Additionally, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or local law enforcement, including your Attorney General, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC's website at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, call the FTC at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338), or write to FTC at Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

You may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:

Equifax: (800) 685-1111
Experian: (888) 397-3742
TransUnion: (888) 909-8872

You also have other rights under the FCRA. For further information about your rights under the FCRA, please visit: http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201410_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf.

Lastly, you can obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes. For example, you can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition, you can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a security freeze to restrict access to your credit report:

Equifax: (800) 685-1111
Experian: (888) 397-3742
TransUnion: (888) 909-8872

As a precaution, we have arranged the option for you to enroll in a complimentary one-year credit monitoring service. We have engaged Experian to provide you with its IdentityWorksSM identity protection services, which includes credit monitoring from all three bureaus, access to your Experian credit report, $1 million in identity theft insurance, and identity restoration services.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<Name 1>>:

Blackbaud, Inc., which is recognized as the world's leading provider of administrative, fundraising, and financial management software for nonprofit organizations, recently informed us about a data security incident that occurred in May 2020. This incident involved hundreds of organizations worldwide, including Crystal Stairs, Inc. We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously, and we are contacting you to explain the incident and provide you with steps you can take to protect yourself.

What Happened?

Blackbaud reported that upon discovering this breach, they worked with security consultants to respond to the threat. Following its investigation, Blackbaud notified Crystal Stairs that the cybercriminal may have accessed or acquired Blackbaud customer data before Blackbaud locked them out on May 20, 2020. Blackbaud informed us that the perpetrators told Blackbaud that the stolen data was destroyed. Based on the nature of the incident, the research Blackbaud performed, and analysis by third-party investigators, Blackbaud informed us that it has no reason to believe that the cybercriminals transmitted or disseminated any of the data publicly. Blackbaud has also hired a team of experts to continue monitoring for any such activity. Once Blackbaud notified Crystal Stairs, we immediately began an investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive stakeholder data was potentially involved.

What Information Was Involved?

Crystal Stairs' investigation determined that the involved Blackbaud systems contained your name and Social Security number or tax identification number. Blackbaud paid for the return of all information that was involved in the incident.

What Are We Doing?

Your confidentiality and privacy, and the security of your information in our care, are among our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. Blackbaud is not aware of any instances of fraudulent activity related to this breach. However, we are committed to holding Blackbaud accountable and keeping your personal information safe and secure. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of your information, we are working with Blackbaud to evaluate additional measures and safeguards necessary to protect against this type of incident in the future. We are also notifying state regulators of this incident. As an additional safeguard, Crystal Stairs is providing twelve (12) months of identity protection service through TransUnion, at no cost to you, if you choose to enroll.

What Can You Do?

We encourage you to review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information. There you will find general information on what you can do to help protect your personal information and more information on the identity monitoring services Crystal Stairs is offering and how to enroll.

For More Information.

If you have additional questions, please call our dedicated assistance line at 855-907-2138, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 6 am to 6 pm Pacific Time.

Dear [Recipient],

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened

Combe Incorporated (Combe) values and respects your privacy and is committed to keeping your information confidential. Our commitment to these values includes notifying individuals if we believe the confidentiality of their personal information might have been compromised. Accordingly, we are writing to advise you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

We recently learned that an unauthorized third party placed computer code that was capable of collecting information on the checkout page of our website from March 2, 2020 until April 10, 2020. Upon learning of the incident, we promptly removed the malicious code and conducted an internal investigation with the help of a leading computer forensic firm.

What Information Was Involved

We are notifying you because of your purchase on our website when the code was active. As a result of the unauthorized code, some of your information, including your name, email address, physical address, and credit card information ending in [last four digits], may have been obtained by the third party. The incident did not impact your Social Security Number.

What We Are Doing

We have already taken steps to alert the credit card companies of the incident, so that they can monitor your account for potential fraudulent activity. We also recommend that you check your debit or credit card statements for fraudulent charges. We take this situation very seriously and have taken additional technical steps to further secure Combe's website and prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future.

What You Can Do

As mentioned above, your Social Security number was not impacted so we do not believe your identity is at risk as a result of this incident. Nonetheless, as a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Other Important Information

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes and steps to you can take to avoid identity theft. For more information and to contact the FTC, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You may also contact the FTC at: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Credit Reports:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf. Alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies. Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries, including obtaining information about fraud alerts and placing a security freeze on your credit files, is as follows:

Fraud Alerts:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes:

You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.

Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information:

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear Parent,

We are writing to inform you of a recent incident that involved your data. Lemoore Union High School District (LUHSD) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents.

What Happened?

LUHSD uses the Aeries Student Information System to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. In late November 2019, Aeries learned that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. Aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. Upon discovery, Aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who Aeries believes is now in police custody. On April 27, 2020, Aeries confirmed to us that this individual may have accessed LUHSD's Aeries System.

What Information Was Involved?

The information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties - for the Aeries System.

What You Can Do

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. Even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, you will be required to change your password the next time you sign into your account. Additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

What We Are Doing

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. In order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. To help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that Aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our Aeries system. In addition, we and Aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

For More Information

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions, please call the LUHSD District Office between 8:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., email noreply@luhsd.k12.ca.us, and someone will contact you.

Sincerely,

Debbie Muro, Superintendent	The data breach was caused by an unauthorized individual exploiting a vulnerability in the Aeries software that allowed access to student and parent information.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [name],

We are writing to inform you of a data security issue involving certain personal information. We recently discovered that an unauthorized party accessed some systems on our network between approximately June 11 and June 29, 2020. We immediately began investigating the nature and scope of the issue and securing our systems. We engaged leading security experts to assist with our investigation and coordinated with law enforcement authorities.

Based on our investigation, we believe the unauthorized party acquired certain employment-related records stored on the affected systems. The affected records contained personal information such as name, contact information, date of birth, government-issued ID (such as Social Security, passport, military ID, tax ID, and/or driver's license numbers), financial account information (such as bank account and/or payment card information), online account usernames and passwords, and/or health-related information (including health insurance information). Not all of this information was affected for each impacted individual.

We take the protection of personal information very seriously and have put in place additional security measures to help further protect our systems. We are alerting you about this issue so you can take steps to help protect your relevant information.

RE: Notice of Data Breach
Exposed customer information

We are writing to notify you that certain information related to your CRB Auto loan may have been temporarily exposed to a third party during the process of recycling and donating a single retired bank computer to a non-profit agency. The security of your non-public personal information is very important to CRB Auto, a division of Mechanics Bank, and additional safeguards have been implemented to ensure that this unintentional disclosure not be possible in the future.

The summary information below is being provided to you in order to answer potential questions you may have related to the unintentional disclosure.

What Happened?
In February 2020, Mechanics Bank donated aging computers to a non-profit organization. As is standard, prior to donation, Mechanics Bank personnel removed the hard drives from the machines being donated. On the same day that the computers were donated, an information security official from the entity that received the donated computers contacted Mechanics Bank and notified it that a single hard drive had been missed and not removed.

The fee is waived if you are a victim of identity theft and have submitted a valid investigative or law enforcement report or complaint relating to the identity theft incident to the credit reporting agencies. (You must review your state's requirement(s) and/or credit bureau requirement(s) for the specific document(s) to be submitted.)

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear [Individual],

At Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and its subsidiaries International Medication Systems, Ltd., and Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, the Company), we take the privacy of our employees and former employees very seriously. It is important to us that you are made aware of an isolated security incident involving your personal information and to identify steps you can take to protect yourself. The Company has policies in place to protect confidential information including the personal information of its employees.

What Happened?

On July 24, 2020, the Company learned for the first time that some Company data had been posted on the internet without authorization on July 21. Most of the information was legacy data (approximately 15 years old) and included some of your personal information along with other company records.

The Company immediately investigated this posting to learn what happened with the assistance of a leading specialist routinely retained to assess and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The posting was determined to be related to an earlier ransomware attack on May 2, 2020 that had been fully contained without any indication that data had been removed based on available records. No payment was or will be made to the criminals responsible for this malicious/criminal act. The Company was able to use backups and restore business continuity promptly. As law enforcement and others have reported, ransomware attacks have increased and have targeted the healthcare industry in the United States and around the world including during the global pandemic.

1What Information Was Involved?

The personal information that was involved included your first and last name, and Social Security Number. To be clear, other personal information was not involved. For example, the Company has concluded that there was no drivers license number or government identification number, credit card or financial account number, medical or health insurance information, biometric data, or user name or email address along with a password or security question and answer.

What We Are Doing

We wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take this matter very seriously. After reviewing and investigating this incident, while we have no evidence that your information was misused, we concluded that it is important to make you aware of this incident. We are also providing 24 months of fraud detection and identity restoration services through Experian, at no cost to you, as summarized in the attachment (How to Enroll in Credit Monitoring).

What You Can Do

We encourage you to consider these measures to monitor and protect your personal information and to remain vigilant for potential incidents of fraud and identity theft:

Vigilance: Regularly monitor your financial accounts and, if you see any unfamiliar activity, promptly contact your financial institution. Monitor your credit reports, which are available free of charge, as noted below.

Free Annual Credit Report: Obtain a free annual credit report from each of the three national consumer credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) by calling (877) 322-8228 or by logging onto www.annualcreditreport.com.

Fraud Alert: You may place a fraud alert on your credit file to ask creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. This request, which can be made from any of the three national consumer credit reporting companies, can help detect any possible misuse of your personal information. Note that a fraud alert may protect you but also may cause delay when you seek to obtain credit. The initial fraud alert is active for 90 days and can be renewed.

Security Freeze: You may place a security freeze on your credit files. A freeze prevents an authorized person from using your personal identifying information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national consumer credit reporting companies at the toll-free telephone numbers or websites listed below. The fee is $10 for each credit reporting agency, but the agencies may waive the fee if you can prove that identity theft has occurred. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze.

Subject: An Update from JGI

Dear Friends of JGI,

We're reaching out to let you know that the Jane Goodall Institute was notified of a data security incident at one of our vendors, Blackbaud. We believe that alerting you is the right thing to do in the interests of transparency and fairness that are at the heart of our organization.

Blackbaud works with many large and small nonprofits, including the Jane Goodall Institute, to support fundraising and engagement efforts. Last week, Blackbaud notified us that it was the target of a ransomware attack that involved the information of a number of its clients. As a result, the hackers obtained some personally identifying information about Blackbaud's nonprofit clients' donors and prospective donors, including those of the Jane Goodall Institute. We believe your information was likely involved.

Please note that no credit card or bank account information was compromised in this attack, as this information is kept separately and encrypted. Your social security number is not in any of our systems and therefore is also not impacted. Blackbaud believes they have successfully retrieved the stolen data and prevented it from being used in an unauthorized way. We believe this is true, but are following up to verify.

Our contracts with Blackbaud have always required them to keep our constituent information confidential and to have security procedures in place to minimize breaches. We are conducting an independent inquiry into this incident and are actively investigating the cause of the incident, the data involved, details of the incident, and Blackbaud's plans to prevent reoccurrence. We are also exploring all options to ensure this does not happen again, including the possibility of using a provider other than Blackbaud going forward.

For more information from Blackbaud on the incident, visit: https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident

The privacy of donors and supporters like you is of the utmost importance, and we promise to do everything in our power to ensure your private information remains secure.

Re: Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear Office of the Attorney General:

This letter is to inform you that the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI) has experienced a data security incident involving a ransomware attack on one of JGI's vendors. The incident potentially affects personal information of individual donors and prospective donors to JGI.

On or about July 22, 2020, JGI learned that in May 2020, Blackbaud, a vendor that supports JGI's fundraising and engagement efforts, experienced a ransomware attack on systems that contained information of a number of its nonprofit clients. As a result, hackers obtained personally identifying information about Blackbaud's nonprofit clients' donors and prospective donors, including those of JGI. JGI initially believed that Blackbaud had sent or would send notifications to state authorities like your office, but it subsequently learned that was not the case. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, JGI is sending this notice to you at this time.

After investigation, JGI has determined that information on Blackbaud's systems at the time of the ransomware incident did not include credit card or bank account information because this information is kept separately and encrypted. Nor were social security numbers of donors or prospective donors impacted, because JGI does not keep this information on its systems.

At this time, JGI has no evidence that the personal information of its affected donors and prospective donors has been used inappropriately. JGI's contracts with Blackbaud require Blackbaud to keep JGI's donor information confidential and to have security procedures in place, and Blackbaud has indicated to JGI that it has successfully retrieved the stolen data and prevented it from being used in an unauthorized way. Nevertheless, JGI sent notifications by mail and email to affected donors and prospective donors to explain what happened, what information was involved, what JGI has done and how affected donors and prospective donors can contact JGI with questions.

Further information about what JGI has done and is recommending to the individuals in question can be found in the enclosed notification that JGI sent to approximately 839 Iowa residents via mail and email on July 31, 2020. JGI notified 539 Iowa residents via mail, and JGI notified affected individuals whose state of residence is unknown via email. Of the individuals notified by email, JGI estimates that 300 live in Iowa.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Becerra:

Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman and Dicker LLP (Wilson Elser) represents Ferris Marketing, Inc. (Ferris), a computer and office equipment wholesaler, with respect to a potential data security incident involving Night Owl Security Products LLC (Night Owl), a subsidiary of Ferris, (hereinafter, the Incident) described in more detail below. Ferris takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

1. Nature of the security Incident.

On May 29, 2020, Ferris was alerted by Visa Inc. (VISA) that Night Owls retail website - https://nightowlsp.com/ - was the last Common Point of Purchase (CPP) for credit cards legitimately used to purchase products from Night Owl which were later used to make fraudulent purchases using VISA payment cards. Upon further investigation by Ferris, Ferris discovered on June 5, 2020 that this Incident was likely caused by an unknown cyber attackers malicious insertion of a script onto Night Owls website which allowed the cyber attacker to orchestrate a credit card fraud scheme against those who made purchases on Night Owls website after the malicious script was dropped on or around November 1, 2019 and before it was removed on June 5, 2020.

At this time, Ferris has no evidence to indicate that the individual responsible for the cyber incident viewed or otherwise acquired any personal information belonging to California residents other than names, addresses, and any payment card information previously used to make a purchase on Night Owls website.

2. Number of California residents affected.

On or about July 13, 2020, Ferris finished identifying one thousand four hundred and thirty-nine (1,439) California residents who were potentially affected by this Incident. Incident notification letters addressed to these individuals were mailed on July 31, 2020, via First Class Mail. A sample copy of the Incident notification letter being mailed to potentially affected residents of California is included with this letter.

3. Steps taken.

On June 5, 2020, the same day that Ferris identified the malware infection on Night Owls retail website, Ferris removed the infection and shut down public access to Night Owls retail website. During the following twenty days, Ferris took steps to ensure the security of Night Owls website including the migration to a different hosting provider as well as the performance of upgrades to its network and software. Night Owls website reopened for public use on June 26, 2020.

Ferris has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. These steps include strengthening Ferriss cybersecurity posture by implementing enhanced software monitoring programs and firewall protection to resist the future occurrence of any similar cybersecurity events.

Ferris has also gone to great lengths to identify and notify any individuals who were potentially impacted as a result of this Incident, including the hiring of a third-party vendor to arrange for any potentially affected residents of California to receive complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for twelve (12) months.

4. Contact information.

Ferris remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information within its control. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Robert.Walker@wilsonelser.com or (601) 499-8083.	Ferris Marketing Inc. experienced a data breach due to a script being inserted onto Night Owl Security Products LLC's website by an unknown cyber attacker, which allowed the attacker to orchestrate a credit card fraud scheme against those who made purchases on Night Owl's website after the malicious script was dropped on or around November 1, 2019, and before it was removed on June 5, 2020.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: Notice of Data Breach

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have affected your personal information. At Stericycle, safeguarding confidential information is one of our top priorities. We want to emphasize that we have no evidence of unauthorized access or compromise of your personal information. However, as a precautionary measure, we are providing this notice to inform you of the steps we are taking and the measures you can take to protect your information.

What Happened?

We conducted an investigation, with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm, into email phishing attempts that targeted Stericycle employees. These phishing attempts aimed to compromise Stericycle employee email accounts. On July 27, 2020, we discovered that your personal information was contained in at least one of the email accounts that appeared to have been accessed by an unauthorized individual. The dates of potential unauthorized access varied by email account, but the overall period of unauthorized access to the email accounts was between October 2019 and April 2020. Although the employee email accounts themselves appear to have been accessed by an unauthorized individual, our investigation revealed no evidence that any email message containing your personal information was actually accessed by an unauthorized individual.

What Information Was Involved?

The types of personal information contained in the email accounts varied by individual. In general, a limited number of emails contained in the impacted email accounts may have included one or more of the following types of personal information: Name, Social Security Number, Tax ID Number, Drivers License Number, Passport Number, financial account/payment card account number, and medical or health insurance information.

What We Are Doing

Stericycle uses robust measures to protect your personal information. These measures are reviewed and frequently updated, as appropriate, by our internal Information Technology team and external experts that support us. We strive to continually improve our data security and maintain a secure environment for confidential and personal information. Stericycle immediately launched an investigation into the suspected phishing activity, secured each impacted employee email account, and has continued to monitor for suspicious activity. We have also reviewed and updated our employee email security controls where appropriate and have continued to train our workforce regarding cybersecurity issues. As an added precaution, we are providing access to 24 months of MyIDCare credit monitoring and identity protection services at no cost to you, through ID Experts. MyIDCare services include: 24 months of credit monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed ID theft recovery services.

NOTICE OF SECURITY INCIDENT

Dear [Name],

The American Payroll Association (APA) is writing to inform you that a data security incident was discovered on or around July 13, 2020, which involved some of your personal information.

What Happened?

The APA experienced a skimming cyberattack in which personal information was accessed by unauthorized individuals. The source of the cyberattack is thought to have been a vulnerability in APA's content management system, which allowed a skimmer to be installed on both the login webpage of the APA website, as well as the checkout section of the APA's online store. APA's IT team uncovered unusual activity on the site dating back to May 13, 2020, at approximately 7:30 pm CT.

What Information Was Accessed?

The unauthorized individuals gained access to login information (i.e., username and password) and individual payment card information (i.e., credit card information and associated data). By way of account access, the electronic fields that may have been accessed include: First and Last Names; Email Address; Job Title and Job Role; Primary Job Function and to whom you Report; Gender; Date of Birth; Address (either business of personal), including country, province or state, city, and postal code; Company name and size; Employee Industry; Payroll Software used at Workplace; Time and Attendance software used at work. In addition, some accounts include profile photos and social media username information.

What Are We Doing?

Since discovering the cyberattack, APA has installed the latest security patches from our content management system to prevent any further exploitation of their website. APA technicians also reviewed all code changes made to the APA website since January; installed additional antivirus software on our servers; and increased the frequency of security patch implementation.

What Can You Do?

APA wants to make you aware of additional steps you may take to guard against identity theft or fraud. APA encourages you to be vigilant by regularly reviewing your account statements and online activity. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained.

Use Tools From Credit Providers.

Carefully review your financial reports and bank, credit card, and other account statements. Be proactive and create alerts on credit cards and bank accounts to notify you of activity. If you discover unauthorized or suspicious activity on your credit report or by any other means, file an identity theft report with your local police.

Reset Your Password.

Again, APA has also required all affected users to reset their password. If you have not done so, please reset your password information as soon as possible.

Free Credit Monitoring.

APA is offering you 12 months of free credit monitoring and $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance through Equifax. With Equifax ID Patrol, you will be provided with daily credit monitoring of your Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion credit files, daily access to your Equifax Credit Report, and an annual 3-in-1 Credit Report with your credit history as reported by the three major credit reporting agencies. You must activate the Equifax ID Patrol by 11:59 p.m. ET on October 31, 2020, in order for it to be effective. To activate, go to www.myservices.equifax.com/patrol and enter your activation code: <Enter Activation Code>. There is a 4-step enrollment process, which includes identity authentication.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Subject: Follow-up Security Notification from Havenly

Dear [NAME],

We are writing to provide you with additional details regarding a potential security incident involving the username and password used for your account on www.havenly.com.

What Happened:
Havenly, Inc. recently learned that an outside individual gained unauthorized access to a database containing the usernames and hashed passwords of Havenly users. Based upon the findings from an independent forensic investigation, we believe this potential incident may have occurred on or around June 25, 2020.

What Information Was Involved:
The database contained your first and last name, Havenly account username, and the hashed password for your account. Havenly does not store full credit card numbers or billing addresses on its own servers, and these types of personal information were not affected by this incident. At this time, no unauthorized activity has been identified in any Havenly customer accounts.

What We Are Doing:
We take the privacy of personal information seriously and deeply regret that this incident occurred. We promptly took steps to address this incident shortly after learning of a potential issue. On July 29, 2020, as a precaution we logged all Havenly users out of their accounts, performed a password reset, and provided notice of the password reset to the email address associated with your Havenly account. We also promptly initiated an internal investigation and retained an independent forensic investigation firm to assist us in our investigation and response. Havenly has been in contact with federal law enforcement regarding this matter and is taking steps to help prevent something like this from recurring in the future, including by resetting passwords and enhancing security measures related to our user database.

What You Can Do:
The next time you log in at www.havenly.com, you will be asked to reset your Havenly password (if you have not done so already). You can also change the password of any other online accounts or services that use the same username and password combination. It is always a best practice to use different passwords for each online website or service you use, and to change your passwords on a regular basis.

For More Information:
For more information about this incident, or if you have additional questions or concerns, you may contact us at hello@havenly.com. We sincerely regret any concern this may cause.

Sincerely,
Cristina DeVito
Havenly Chief Financial Officer	An outside individual gained unauthorized access to a database containing the usernames and hashed passwords of Havenly users.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

Assured Imaging (Assured) is writing to inform you of a recent event that may impact the security of some of your information. Although we are unaware of any actual misuse of your information, we are providing you with information about the event, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On May 19, 2020, Assured learned that its electronic medical records system had become encrypted due to ransomware deployed by an unknown actor. Because the impacted systems contained patient and employee information, Assured worked quickly to (1) restore access to the patient information so it could continue to care for patients without disruption and (2) investigate what happened and whether this incident resulted in any unauthorized access to, or theft of, personal information by the unknown actor. Assured conducted an extensive investigation, with the assistance of third-party computer forensic specialists to determine the nature and scope of the incident. On July 1, 2020, the investigation confirmed Assured systems were accessible by an unknown actor between May 15, 2020 and May 17, 2020, and certain, limited data was exfiltrated from our systems. The investigation was unable to determine the full extent of information that was accessed by the unknown actor. In an abundance of caution, we performed a comprehensive review of all information stored in our systems at the time of incident to identify the individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unknown actor. We then worked to determine the identities and contact information for potentially impacted individuals.

What Information Was Involved?

We determined the following types of information relating to you were present in the affected system and therefore potentially accessed by the unknown actor during this incident: name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, drivers license number, bank account number, and employee identification number. We are unaware that any of this information was misused by the unknown actor and Assured is providing this notice in an abundance of caution.

What We Are Doing?

We take this incident and the security of your personal information seriously. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately took steps to restore our operations and further secure our systems. As part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy of personal information in our care, we are working to review our existing policies and procedures and to implement additional safeguards to further secure the information in our systems. Assured also notified the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other government regulators, as required. While we are unaware of any misuse of your information as a result of this incident, we are offering you access to 12 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you that a cybersecurity incident occurred on August 5, 2020, involving several e-commerce websites operated by Warner Music Group (WMG) through an external service provider. This incident may have allowed an unauthorized third party to obtain personal information that you entered into those websites. We want to emphasize that keeping personal information safe and secure is of utmost importance to us, and we deeply regret that this incident has occurred.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On August 5, 2020, we discovered that an unauthorized third party had compromised several US-based e-commerce websites that WMG operates but are hosted and supported by an external service provider. This allowed the unauthorized third party to potentially acquire a copy of the personal information you entered into one or more of the affected website(s) between April 25, 2020, and August 5, 2020.

Although we cannot confirm definitively that your personal information was affected, it is possible that it might have been as your transaction(s) occurred during the period of compromise. If it was, this might have exposed you to a risk of fraudulent transactions being carried out using your details.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

Any personal information you entered into one or more of the affected website(s) between April 25, 2020, and August 5, 2020, after placing an item in your shopping cart was potentially acquired by the unauthorized third party. This could have included your name, email address, telephone number, billing address, shipping address, and payment card details (card number, CVC/CVV, and expiration date). Payments made through PayPal were not affected by this incident.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

Upon discovering the incident, we immediately launched a thorough forensic investigation with the assistance of leading outside cybersecurity experts and promptly took steps to address and correct the issue. We also notified the relevant credit card providers as well as law enforcement, with whom we continue to cooperate.

To protect you further, we are offering identity monitoring services through Kroll for 12 months, free of charge. You can find further details below on how to sign up.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

We strongly encourage you to take advantage of the identity monitoring services we are offering and to remain vigilant for any unauthorized use of your payment cards or suspicious email communications, particularly those purporting to come from Warner Music Group or any WMG-related websites.

If you identify any potentially suspicious transactions or other indications of identity theft, you should contact the relevant bank or card provider as soon as possible. Please also find enclosed additional steps that you can take to protect yourself, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.

To Whom It May Concern:

On behalf of Warner Music Group (WMG), and consistent with Iowa Code Ann. 715C.2, this letter provides notice of a computer data security incident. Although our investigation is ongoing, based on currently known information, WMG believes approximately 967 potentially affected individuals reside in your state.

WMG is a music entertainment company that also sells merchandise on behalf of a number of bands and artists with which it works. On August 5, 2020, WMG learned that an unauthorized third party had compromised a number of US-based e-commerce websites that WMG operates but that are hosted and supported by an external service provider. This allowed the unauthorized third party to potentially acquire a copy of information customers entered on the affected websites after placing an item into their shopping carts. This could have impacted purchases made with credit cards from the affected websites between April 25, 2020 and August 5, 2020. The information compromised could have included the individuals name, email address, telephone number, billing address, shipping address, and payment card details (card number, CVC/CVV and expiration date).

Upon discovering the incident, WMG immediately launched a thorough forensic investigation with the assistance of leading outside cybersecurity experts and promptly took steps to address and correct the issue. WMG continues to conduct daily scans to monitor for any suspicious activity and, at this time, WMGs believe that the third party's unauthorized access has been eliminated. WMG also notified the relevant card providers as well as law enforcement, and is continuing to work with both the card providers and law enforcement.

While WMG cannot definitively confirm which individuals' data was potentially acquired by the unauthorized third party, WMG is in the process of notifying potentially affected customers in accordance with applicable legal requirements	There was an unauthorized third party who compromised a number of US-based e-commerce websites that WMG operates but are hosted and supported by an external service provider, allowing them to acquire a copy of information customers entered, including payment card details.

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident involving unauthorized access to Sekure Merchant Solutions' (Sekure) environment. Upon becoming aware of suspicious activity, we immediately secured our network and hired a computer forensics firm to assist with the investigation. The investigation determined that an unauthorized actor was able to remove data from our network and published names and email addresses associated with our merchant clients on the dark web. Sekure conducted a thorough review of the data posted on the dark web, and except for client names and email addresses, no other information was posted. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, Sekure conducted a comprehensive review of the entire contents of the database we use to store merchant applications that could have been accessed by the unauthorized actor and determined on June 4, 2020, that this database contained some of your personal information, including your name, Social Security number, and driver's license number.

To date, we have no indication that your personal information was viewed by the unauthorized party or misused. To help prevent this type of incident from happening in the future, we have implemented enhanced security measures, including multifactor authentication, additional data security training to employees, and have implemented more robust security tools to scan and block suspicious messages.

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour.

We immediately secured the affected systems, launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident, and a specialized cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist. We restored our computer systems to fully operational.

What Information Was Involved?

Through the forensic investigation, we identified certain systems that the unauthorized third party accessed during the incident. The accessed systems contained folders with information related to current and former employees. The investigation did not determine whether the unauthorized person actually viewed or accessed all of the files within these folders; however, we were not able to rule out that possibility. We therefore reviewed the contents of the files to identify the types of personal information involved. On August 21, 2020, we determined that one or more of these files contained your <<b2b_text_1(ImpactedData)>>.

As an added precaution, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year.

If your health insurance information was involved, it is also advisable to review the billing statements you receive from your health insurer. If you see charges for services you did not receive, please contact the insurer immediately.

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then	The breach was caused by an outside party hacking into Osmose Utilities' computer systems and accessing folders containing personal information of current and former employees.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: Notice of Data Breach

Vermont Student Assistance Corporation (VSAC) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect the security of some of your information. On July 16, 2020, VSAC received notice that one of its third-party vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud), suffered a cyber incident. Blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to many non-profit organizations, including VSAC. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we are providing you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect yourself, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

In May 2020, Blackbaud experienced a ransomware incident that impacted certain systems within the Blackbaud environment. As a result of this incident, certain Blackbaud systems were encrypted and a Blackbaud database backup file including VSAC data was removed from the Blackbaud environment by an unauthorized actor. While Blackbaud's investigation was able to determine that the backup file was removed between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020, their investigation was unable to confirm exactly when this occurred. As a result, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain information contained within the backup database. Upon learning of this incident, VSAC immediately began an investigation to determine the full nature and scope of the event and what, if any, VSAC data may have been impacted. On or about August 7, 2020, VSAC's investigation determined that the backup database may have contained personal information.

What Information Was Involved?

While Blackbaud reports that information was accessed, Blackbaud was unable to confirm what, if any, specific sensitive information was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor. Blackbaud has also represented to us that they have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Regardless, out of an abundance of caution, VSAC is notifying you of this incident because you are or were a customer or client of VSAC, and information related to you was potentially present in the database at the time of this incident. Our investigation determined that the information related to you included your name and Social Security number. To date, VSAC has not received any reports of actual or attempted misuse of your information.

Dear Sample A Sample:

What Are We Doing?

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care are one of our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. When we were notified of this incident, we immediately commenced an investigation to determine what VSAC data may have been at risk. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information in our care, we are working to review our existing policies and procedures regarding our third-party vendors and are working with Blackbaud to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future	The breach was due to a ransomware incident and the unauthorized actor removed a backup file containing VSAC data from the Blackbaud environment. Blackbaud was unable to confirm what specific sensitive information was accessed, but VSAC's investigation revealed that the data may have included personal information, such as names and Social Security numbers.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear Member of the PKD Community,

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may involve your personal information. We take the privacy of your information seriously, and as a precautionary measure, we want to let you know what happened.

On July 16, 2020, we were contacted by Blackbaud, one of the world's largest providers of customer relationship management systems for non-profit organizations and the higher education sector. Blackbaud informed us that a service provider had been the victim of a ransomware attack that culminated in May 2020. Although the cybercriminal was unsuccessful in blocking access to the database involved in the attack, they were able to remove a copy of a subset of data from several of Blackbaud's clients, including data of Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation.

We would like to reassure you that a detailed forensic investigation was undertaken by law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity experts on behalf of Blackbaud. Blackbaud has confirmed that the cybercriminal did not access your credit or debit card information, bank account information, or social security number because that information was stored in an encrypted format. Also, please note that Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation does not store social security numbers or bank account information. The data accessed by the cybercriminal in the Blackbaud database may have contained some of the following information in some of the data records:

- Public information such as name, title, date of birth, spouse
- Addresses and contact details such as phone numbers and email addresses
- Philanthropic interests, giving capacity, and giving history to the Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation
- Transplant Status

Blackbaud has taken steps to protect constituent data of Blackbaud clients like Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation and mitigate potential identity theft. Blackbaud met the cybercriminal's ransomware demand to ensure that the data was destroyed and is no longer usable or accessible by any unauthorized persons or entities. Blackbaud continues to monitor the web to verify that the data accessed by the cybercriminal has not been misused.

Upon notification of this breach by Blackbaud, we immediately launched our investigation and have taken the following steps:

- We are notifying affected volunteers, donors, employees, and others in our network that may have been affected to make them aware of this breach of Blackbaud's systems.
- We are working with Blackbaud to understand why there was a delay between it finding the breach and notifying us, as well as what actions Blackbaud is taking to increase its security to ensure our data will be protected against future threats.
- We are conferring with other Blackbaud clients to share information about this breach, resulting corrective actions, and identify any additional recommended best practices.

We do not believe there is a need for our constituents to take any action at this time. Although your financial account information was not accessed in this security breach, we recommend that you remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious account activity or suspected identity theft to the proper authorities. We recommend that you obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months. You may also want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report.

For more information, please visit IdentityTheft.gov or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338).

If you have any questions related to the security incident, please contact Chad Iseman, Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation, Chief Advancement Officer, (800) 753-2873, prompt #3, and pkdcure@pkdcure.org. We regret the inconvenience that this data breach may have caused. Please be assured that we take data protection very seriously and are grateful for the continued support of our alumni and friends.

Sincerely,

Andy Betts, President and CEO
Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation	The service provider of Blackbaud was the victim of a ransomware attack where a copy of a subset of data was removed from several of Blackbaud's clients, including data of Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation.

September 4, 2020

Dear xxxxxxxx,

We are writing to let you know of a recent data security incident at Blackbaud Inc., a data service vendor for the Hydrocephalus Association (HA). Blackbaud is a leading provider of software services and hosts files or backups for hundreds of schools, foundations, and nonprofits like HA around the world. Blackbaud recently informed us that it discovered and resolved a cybersecurity incident impacting its systems, which affected many of its nonprofit clients, including HA.

What Happened?

We are contacting you regarding this incident with Blackbaud because some of your personal information may have been disclosed. On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud sent an email to HA stating that it had discovered a security incident in May of 2020. Blackbaud determined that an unauthorized third party had removed a copy of certain non-financial data, including data from HA and other Blackbaud clients, at some point between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020. Although Blackbaud told us that it believes the data was destroyed after Blackbaud made a payment in response to a demand from the unauthorized third party, we cannot independently confirm the destruction of the data. Blackbaud has provided additional details about this incident on its website.

What Information Was Involved?

First and foremost, please be reassured that your bank account or credit card information was not involved in this incident, as HA does not retain financial information within our database. On August 14, 2020, we determined that specific information you shared with us through membership communications, registrations, or surveys may have been part of this breach. This could include name, address, your connection to HA, the date of birth of you or your loved one with hydrocephalus, and limited health information (e.g., patient's name, age of diagnosis, type of hydrocephalus, and/or comorbidities or complications), to the extent you provided this information.

For clarity, please know that the incident did not involve information associated with our patient registry, HAPPIER. Information for that patient registry is stored in a separate database at the University of Utah, outside of Blackbaud. That information is de-identified, meaning the information that could link it to you has been removed, and it is not part of this incident. Information stored in HydroAssist, our mobile app, is also not a part of this incident. HydroAssist data is stored in a separate database outside of Blackbaud.

What We Are Doing.

We are extremely frustrated about this event and take this matter very seriously. Safeguarding your personal information is a top priority for us. We are not aware of any misuse to date of the compromised information, and as previously stated, Blackbaud has communicated its confidence that the data was destroyed. Regardless, upon learning of this incident, we immediately began working to investigate the incident and to identify and notify individuals affected.

We require Blackbaud to keep our information confidential and to maintain security procedures to minimize the risk of information security incidents. If an information security incident does occur, Blackbaud is required to notify us, to work with us to mitigate negative consequences from the incident, and to implement procedures to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. We will review our work with Blackbaud to ensure it meets that commitment and are in the process of evaluating our relationship with Blackbaud more generally.

What You Can Do.

Although no credit card or bank account information was compromised as part of this incident, given the increased threats to privacy in our world we recommend that you remain vigilant and regularly review and monitor all of your credit history to guard against any unauthorized transactions or activity. We also recommend that you closely monitor your account statements and notify your financial institution if you suspect any unauthorized activity. Additionally, you should not provide personal information in response to electronic communications regarding security breaches. Attachment A contains more information about steps you can take to protect yourself against fraud and identity theft.

For More Information

Please be assured that we are taking steps to address the incident and to protect the security of your data. If you have any questions about this notice or the incident, please feel free to contact us at security@hydroassoc.org.

ATTACHMENT A

Additional Information

To protect against possible fraud, identity theft or other financial loss, we encourage you to remain vigilant, to review your account statements and to monitor your credit reports. Provided below are the names and contact information for the three major U.S. credit bureaus and additional information about steps you can take to obtain a free credit report and place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report. If you believe you are a victim of fraud or identity theft, you should consider contacting your local law enforcement agency, your State's attorney general, or the Federal Trade Commission.

INFORMATION ON OBTAINING A FREE CREDIT REPORT

U.S. residents are entitled under U.S. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. To order your free credit reports, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free (877) 322-8228.

INFORMATION ON IMPLEMENTING A FRAUD ALERT, CREDIT FREEZE, OR CREDIT LOCK

To place a fraud alert, credit freeze, or credit lock on your credit report, you must contact the three credit reporting agencies below:

Equifax:
Equifax Information Services LLC
P.O. Box 105788
Atlanta, GA 30348
1-888-298-0045
www.equifax.com

Experian:

TransUnion:
Fraud Victim Assistance Department
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
1-800-680-7289
www.transunion.com

Fraud Alert: Consider contacting the three major credit reporting agencies at the addresses below to place a fraud alert on your credit report. A fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. A fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit. Instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. Although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name.

To place a fraud alert, contact any of the three major credit reporting agencies listed above and request that a fraud alert be put on your file. The agency that you contacted must notify the other two agencies. A fraud alert is free and lasts 90 days but can be renewed.

Credit Freeze: A credit freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer's credit report until the freeze is lifted. When a credit freeze is in place, no one including you can open a new account. As a result, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. Placing a credit freeze is free. To place a credit freeze, contact all three credit reporting agencies listed above and provide the personal information required by each agency to place a freeze, which may include:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social	The breach was due to an unauthorized third-party gaining access and removing certain non-financial data, a common sign of a hack.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear [Name]:

Artech, LLC (Artech) is writing to inform you of an incident that could affect the security of some of your information. This notice provides information about the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On January 8, 2020, Artech received a report of unusual activity relating to an employee's Artech user account. We immediately began investigating this report and through that investigation identified ransomware on certain Artech systems. That same day we engaged a leading third-party forensic investigation firm to assess the security of our systems and to confirm the nature and scope of the incident. On January 15, 2020, the investigation determined that an unauthorized actor had access to certain Artech systems between January 5, 2020, and January 8, 2020. Artech undertook a comprehensive review of these systems and determined that some personal information was present in them at the time of the incident. We reviewed this information and our internal records to identify the individuals associated with this information and their contact information for purposes of providing notice. On or around June 25, 2020, we completed this review and determined that some of your personal information was contained in one or more of the involved files.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that at the time of the incident the involved files contained information including your name, [variable text - data elements]. Please note that to date we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

What We Are Doing.

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. Artech has strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon learning of this incident, we quickly took steps to confirm the security of our systems and notified law enforcement of the event. We reset passwords for all Artech users, further strengthened our existing technical controls, and implemented additional security measures. We also reviewed our policies and procedures relating to data security and are conducting additional employee training. As an added precaution, we are also offering you access to [12/24] months of credit monitoring and identity protection services through Kroll at no cost to you. We encourage you to enroll in these services, as we are not able to act on your behalf to do so. More information about these services and instructions on how to enroll may be found in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration.

What You Can Do.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. You may also enroll to receive the free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services we are offering and review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information to learn more about ways to protect personal information.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear Slidely and Promo community,

I am writing to notify you about a targeted breach of some of our servers which hold some of our customers' account information but do not include any financial data. Whilst the issue has been identified and resolved, we continue to work closely with cybersecurity experts and relevant authorities and have already implemented further security measures and features. This message provides important information. We would like to apologize sincerely for the inconvenience caused.

On July 21, 2020, our team became aware that a data security vulnerability on a third-party service which affected many companies had caused a breach affecting certain non-finance related Slidely and Promo user data. We immediately launched an internal investigation to identify what had occurred and to take all necessary steps to protect our customers.

First and foremost, no financial data such as credit cards or billing information was accessed as we never store this information on our servers. The breached servers held the following data: first name, last name, email address, IP address, approximated user location based on the IP address, gender, as well as encrypted, hashed, and salted passwords to Slidely and Promo. Your account password was hashed and salted (a method used to secure passwords with a key), however, it is possible that it could subsequently have been decoded.

We have acted immediately and are taking this incident and the security of your information extremely seriously. We are protecting you and the rest of our community in the following ways:

- We are sending you this update with recommendations on what you should do
- We have completely removed the vulnerable third-party service from our platform
- We've hired a leading cybersecurity specialist to further review and reinforce our protections
- We continuously enhance our safeguards and systems that detect and prevent unauthorized access to user accounts

As an immediate precautionary measure, you should reset the password to your Slidely or Promo account as soon as possible. To do so, please use this link: https://promo.com/forgot and follow the instructions there. Also, if you have been using the same or a similar password for other online accounts, we strongly recommend you change those passwords to protect those accounts as well.

Following our initial email to you on July 23, about a targeted breach of some of our servers which hold some of our customers' account information but do not include any financial data, I am writing to provide further important information. First, we would again like to apologize sincerely for the inconvenience caused. As we mentioned in our earlier email on July 23, the issue has been identified and resolved, and we continue to work closely with cybersecurity experts and relevant authorities and have already implemented further security measures and features.

On July 21, 2020, our team became aware of a data security vulnerability on a third-party service which affected many companies. This caused a breach that occurred between June 22-25, affecting certain non-financial related Slidely and Promo user data. We immediately launched an internal investigation to identify what had occurred and took all necessary steps to protect our customers.

First and foremost, no financial data such as credit cards or billing information was accessed as we never store this information on our servers. The breached servers held the following data: first name, last name, email address, IP address, approximated user location based on the IP address, gender, as well as encrypted, hashed, and salted passwords to Slidely and Promo. Your account password was hashed and salted (a method used to secure passwords with a key); it is possible, however, that it could subsequently have been decoded.

We acted immediately. We are taking this incident and the security of your information extremely seriously. We are protecting you and the rest of our community in the following ways:

- We are sending you this update with recommendations on what you should do
- We have completely removed the vulnerable third-party service from our platform
- We've hired a leading cybersecurity specialist to further review and reinforce our protections
- We continuously enhance our safeguards and systems that detect and prevent unauthorized access to user accounts

As a precautionary measure, you should reset the password to your Slidely or Promo account as soon as possible if you haven't done so already. To do this, please use this link: https://promo.com/forgot and follow the instructions there. Also, if you have been using the same or a similar password for other online accounts, we strongly recommend you change those passwords to protect those accounts as well.

No financial data, such as credit cards or billing information, was accessed as we never store this information on our servers, but government agencies generally advise that consumers remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports. You can obtain information from the Federal Trade Commission and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes. A Security Freeze prevents most potential creditors from viewing your credit reports and therefore, further restricts the opening of unauthorized accounts. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts.

For more information, please contact us at support@promo.com. We are working around the clock and are here to help and support you.

Sincerely,

Tom More, CEO	The breach was caused by a data security vulnerability on a third-party service affecting many companies; our internal investigation identified that non-finance related Slidely and Promo user data including personal information and encrypted, hashed, and salted passwords to Slidely and Promo.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear valued bidder,

We take the protection of your information very seriously. Unfortunately, we are writing to inform you about a data security issue affecting your LiveAuctioneers bidder account information. We are deeply sorry for any concern or inconvenience this may have caused, and are working quickly to take the appropriate steps to prevent such incidents in the future. We hope that in time we can regain your trust, which we value above all.

What Happened

Our cybersecurity team has indeed confirmed that following a cyber attack against one of our IT suppliers on June 19, 2020, an unauthorized third party managed to access certain personal information from our bidder database. We were notified of the incident on July 11, 2020, and began notifying bidders that day through email and our website, based on how recently the bidder had used their LiveAuctioneers account.

LiveAuctioneers was one of a number of their partners who experienced a breach since this IT supplier's security was compromised. Our cybersecurity team has ensured the unauthorized access has ceased.

What Information Was Involved

The data that has been exposed includes user account information like names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, visit history, and encrypted passwords (the unauthorized party, however, managed to decrypt passwords after the cyber attack). Not all of this information may have been present on your bidder account. Please also know that complete payment card numbers were not accessed, and we have no reason to believe auction history was affected.

The exposure of your LiveAuctioneers credentials (i.e. login and password) could affect other online accounts you may have (if they use the same or similar credentials). You could also be exposed to impersonation and phishing attempts.

What We Are Doing

As soon as we became aware of this incident, we blocked the unauthorized access to bidder account information and disabled your most recent LiveAuctioneers password.

We have taken immediate steps to improve our security and prevent such incidents in the future:

- We have suspended our relationship with the compromised IT supplier.
- Our security tokens and passwords throughout LiveAuctioneers systems have been replaced.
- We have implemented stronger password encryption.
- We have partnered with leading cybersecurity experts to further secure our website, mobile apps, and systems.
- We are working with government authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice.
- Multi-factor authentication for all back-end services have been implemented.
- We are analyzing and monitoring our source code to address any vulnerabilities.
- We are continuing to upgrade our network infrastructure.
- We will be implementing stronger password requirements.

What You Can Do

All passwords created before July 11, 2020, have been disabled. If you have not already done so, we encourage you to change your password.

For not logged in bidders: You can access your account by creating a new password, following the steps below:

1. Visit https://www.liveauctioneers.com/ and click Log In on the top right-hand corner of the page.
2. Click Forgot Password on the login window.
3. Enter your email address used for and click Send Reset Instructions.
4. Check your email and follow the link provided to reset your password.

For already logged in bidders: Please click the dropdown from your user icon in the top right corner and click Account Settings. From here, click Change Password.

To help further protect your personal information, please remember:

- Do not use the same or similar credentials for other online accounts.
- Change any and all passwords that used the same or similar credentials as those used for your LiveAuctioneers account.
- Regularly review your online accounts for suspicious activity.
- Be cautious of any unsolicited communications asking for your personal information: we will never ask you to disclose your password via an email or over the phone, for instance.
- Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails.
- If you see any unauthorized activity related to your financial accounts, promptly contact your financial institution.
- For U.S. residents, we also suggest you submit a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission by calling 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338), online at https://www.ftc.gov, or by mail to 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20580.
- You also may want to monitor your credit reports with the major credit reporting agencies:

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: Notice of Data Breach

Enloe Medical Center (Enloe) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect the privacy of some of your information. On Thursday, July 16, 2020, Enloe received notification from one of its third-party vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud), of a cyber incident. Blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to organizations, including Enloe. Upon receiving notice of the cyber incident, we immediately commenced an investigation to better understand the nature and scope of the incident and any impact on Enloe's data. This notice provides information about the Blackbaud incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

Blackbaud reported that, in May 2020, it experienced a ransomware incident that resulted in encryption of certain Blackbaud systems. Blackbaud reported the incident to law enforcement and worked with forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incident. Following its investigation, Blackbaud notified its customers that an unknown actor may have accessed or acquired certain Blackbaud customer data. Blackbaud reported that the data was exfiltrated by the threat actor at some point before Blackbaud locked the threat actor out of the environment on May 20, 2020. Upon learning of the Blackbaud incident, Enloe immediately commenced an investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive Enloe data was potentially involved. This investigation included working diligently to gather further information from Blackbaud to understand the scope of the incident. The Blackbaud event affected thousands of organizations across many different states and countries. Although not the target of the ransomware incident, Enloe was one of the countless organizations that were impacted.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that the impacted Blackbaud systems contained your name, address, medical treatment discharge date, and department where you received care. The system may have also contained your date of birth, phone number, and/or email address. Your Social Security number, credit card number, and bank account information were not present in the Blackbaud system and were therefore not subject to unauthorized access. Please note that, to date, we have not received confirmation from Blackbaud that your specific information was accessed or acquired by the unknown actor.

What We Are Doing.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care are among our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information in our care, we are working to review our existing policies and procedures regarding our third-party vendors, and are working with Blackbaud to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future. We will also be notifying the United States Department of Health and Human Services and state regulators, as required.

Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information

We recommend you remain vigilant for attempts to obtain sensitive information from you using social engineering. This is when someone requests you provide sensitive information such as bank account information or Social Security number by using information about your recent medical visit in an attempt to show the request is legitimate. We also encourage you to review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information. There you will find general information on what you can do to help protect your personal information.

What Can You Do?

We understand that you may have questions about the Blackbaud incident that are not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please call our dedicated assistance line at (855) 380-6161 between the hours of 6 AM to 8 PM PT Monday - Friday or 8 AM to 5 PM PT Saturday - Sunday and be prepared to reference Engagement Number DB22362.

We sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern this incident has caused.

Sincerely,

Mike Wiltermood
President and CEO
Enloe Medical Center

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Monitor Accounts

While your Social Security number, credit card number, and bank account information were not subject to unauthorized access, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.

Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<Name 1>>:

We want to advise you of a security breach affecting information about you maintained by Blackbaud, a third-party service provider of Emanate Health Foundation. This letter explains what happened, what information of yours was involved, and what you can do to protect yourself.

Emanate Health Foundation is dedicated to raising funds and awareness for services that heal and nurture individuals and families throughout the San Gabriel Valley. We work toward fulfilling this mission by collaborating with community members to financially sustain Emanate Health and its award-winning, not-for-profit medical facilities: Emanate Health Inter-Community Hospital, Emanate Health Queen of the Valley Hospital, Emanate Health Foothill Presbyterian Hospital, and Emanate Health Hospice. The Foundation develops philanthropic support for these medical facilities through charitable donations and community awareness. Emanate Health physicians, staff, and volunteers work tirelessly to enhance the well-being of our patients and improve their health outcomes, and they rely on the Foundation's generous contributors as visionary partners in the process.

Unfortunately, the Foundation was recently notified by Blackbaud of a security incident involving your personal information as a patient of one of our affiliated medical facilities. Blackbaud provides services to the Foundation and holds information about our donors and prospective donors under a strict confidentiality agreement. We are notifying you to explain the circumstances and to summarize the steps taken as we take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously.

What Happened?

On July 16, 2020, the Foundation was notified by its third-party provider, Blackbaud, of a security incident which involved your personal information. Blackbaud notified us that it discovered a ransomware attack on its systems around May 20, 2020. Blackbaud retained independent forensics experts and notified law enforcement. Shortly after the discovery, Blackbaud expelled the cybercriminal from its system. However, Blackbaud determined that before being locked out the cybercriminal had removed a copy of the Foundations backup file maintained on Blackbaud's servers, which contained your personal information. Blackbaud believes the cybercriminal accessed this file initially on February 7, 2020, and retained access until May 20, 2020. We understand that Blackbaud confirmed that the backup file copy had been destroyed. Based on the nature of the incident, Blackbaud's research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigations, Blackbaud does not believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was misused, or will be further disseminated.

What Information Was Involved?

The information contained in the Foundations back-up file maintained on Blackbaud's server included your first name, last name, home address, birth date, gender, phone number, e-mail, and the Emanate Health hospital department location in which you were treated. Importantly, Blackbaud confirmed that none of the information contained in the back-up file included any individual's credit card information, bank account information, or social security number.

What Are We Doing?

As part of its ongoing efforts to help avoid an event like this from happening in the future, Blackbaud has affirmed to the Foundation that it has already implemented changes to help protect its system from any subsequent incidents. Since learning of the issue, Blackbaud identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and has taken actions to fix it. Additionally, Blackbaud is accelerating its efforts to further harden its environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint, and network-based platforms. As an additional precautionary measure, Blackbaud has indicated that it has hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web for any further misuse of the data.

What Can You Do?

As a best practice, we recommend you remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities. We also suggest that you review the enclosed document, Privacy Safeguards, for additional information on how to protect against identity theft and fraud.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

STG Holdings, LLC (STG) writes to notify you of a recent incident that may affect the security of some of your personal information. Although at this time there is no indication that your information has been misused in relation to this incident, we are providing you with information about the incident, our response to it, and information related to what you may do to better protect your personal information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On September 10, 2019, STG became aware of unusual activity involving certain employee email accounts and immediately began an investigation with the assistance of third-party computer forensics specialists. The investigation determined that a limited number of employee email accounts were accessed without authorization between June 27, 2019 and September 17, 2019. Although the investigation was unable to determine whether personal information stored in impacted email accounts had actually been viewed or removed by an unauthorized actor, STG could not rule out the possibility of such activity. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, STG performed a thorough review of the information stored within the impacted email accounts and determined that your personal information was potentially affected.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that at the time of the incident the following types of your personal information were stored within an impacted email account and therefore may have been subject to unauthorized access: your <<VARIABLE TEXT 1>> and name.

What Are We Doing?

Information privacy, and security are among STGs highest priorities, and we have strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon learning of this incident, we quickly took steps to confirm the security of our systems, including our employee email accounts. We reset passwords for STG email accounts, conducted additional employee training, and are currently reviewing our policies and procedures relating to data security. Although at this time we have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information in relation to this incident, we are notifying you so that you may take further steps to better protect your personal information should you feel it is appropriate to do so. As an added precaution, we also secured the services of IDExperts to provide identity and credit monitoring services at no cost to you for twelve (12) months. For more information on these services, please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information.

What Can You Do?

Additional Information

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<Name 1>>,

We regret to inform you that CorePower Yoga, LLC (CorePower) recently experienced a data privacy event that may have compromised the security of your personal information. We take this matter seriously and want to provide you with information and resources to help you protect your personal information, if you feel it is necessary.

What Happened?

CorePower discovered suspicious activity in an employee's email account and immediately changed the employee's email account password. An investigation was launched to identify the source of the activity, and with the help of a third-party forensic specialist, it was discovered that multiple employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized access between November 7, 2019, and February 3, 2020. It was not possible to determine which emails and attachments within the email accounts were accessed or viewed. Therefore, the forensic specialist reviewed all the emails and attachments in the email accounts to determine if they contained any sensitive information. On August 13, 2020, the forensic specialist completed its analysis of the email accounts and prepared a list of individuals whose information was determined to be present in the emails or attachments located in the email accounts and possibly viewed by the unauthorized person(s).

What Information is Involved?

Your name and <<Breached Elements>> were found in the email account. We were unable to determine which emails, if any, in the accounts were subject to unauthorized access, but we are providing notice out of an abundance of caution as your information was contained within the email accounts subject to unauthorized access.

What Are We Doing?

We take the security of information entrusted to us very seriously and apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused you. We changed the CorePower employee account passwords at issue, reviewed existing security measures, and are working diligently to implement additional security measures to ensure the security of our network. We are also providing you with information about this event and about the steps you can take to protect your personal information, should you feel it appropriate to do so. We are offering you access to twelve (12) months of free credit and identity monitoring through TransUnion.

What You Can Do.

We encourage you to monitor your credit card statements and other financial accounts closely and report any suspected fraud to your issuing bank. You can also review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information for additional information about how you can protect your identity and on how to enroll in the free credit and identity monitoring services.

We at Baylor Genetics take the privacy and security of personal information very seriously. We are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have involved some of your information.

Baylor Genetics is a laboratory in Houston, Texas that specializes in genetic testing. Your physician previously ordered testing from us, and one or more of those tests were referred to us by your physician.

We recently experienced an email phishing campaign that resulted in a limited number of employees receiving a suspicious email containing a malicious link. Unfortunately, some employees fell victim to the phishing campaign, resulting in an unauthorized individual gaining access to those employees' email accounts. Upon discovering the incident, we disabled the impacted email accounts and required mandatory password resets to prevent further misuse.

While there is no evidence that the phishing campaign was intended to obtain patient information, we are providing notice and offering you credit monitoring services at no charge as a precautionary measure.

We have taken several steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, including implementing additional technical safeguards on our email system and providing additional training and education for our employees to increase awareness of the risks of malicious emails.

After an extensive forensic investigation and manual document review, we discovered that one or more of the email accounts that were accessed between September 24, 2019 and November 14, 2019 contained some of your personal and/or protected health information. Your test results were not included in the information that may have been accessed.

We have taken necessary steps to prevent this from happening again and remain fully committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information in our possession. If you have any further questions regarding this incident, please call our dedicated and confidential toll-free response line at [phone number].

As a precautionary measure, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of Experian IdentityWorksSM. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. For more information on identity theft prevention and IdentityWorks Credit 1B, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

We recommend that you place an initial one-year Fraud Alert on your credit files, at no charge, even if you choose not to use the complimentary credit monitoring services. A fraud alert tells creditors to contact you personally before they open any new accounts. To place a fraud alert, call any one of the three major credit bureaus at the numbers listed below. As soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, they will notify the others.

TransUnion LLC: 1-800-680-7289

If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a Security Freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization.

We have no evidence that your medical information involved in this incident was or will be used for any unintended purposes. However, we recommend that you only share your health insurance cards with your healthcare providers and other family members who are covered under your insurance plan or who help you with your medical care. Review your explanation of benefits statement which you receive from your health insurance company. Follow up with your insurance company or care provider for any items you do not recognize.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and remain committed to protecting your personal information. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,

Blackbaud is a widely-used software and service provider for fundraising and alumni or donor engagement efforts at non-profits and universities worldwide. Inova uses one or more Blackbaud applications, and Blackbaud recently experienced an incident impacting information held on one of those applications. We want to provide you with information about the incident and the significant measures we are taking to protect your information.

What Happened
On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified Inova of a security incident that impacted Blackbaud's clients across the world. Blackbaud reported that they identified an attempted ransomware attack in progress on May 20, 2020. Blackbaud informed us that they stopped the ransomware attack and engaged forensic experts to assist in their internal investigation. That investigation concluded that the threat actor intermittently removed data from Blackbaud's systems between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020. According to Blackbaud, they paid the threat actor to ensure that the data was permanently destroyed.

What Information Was Involved
On August 10, 2020, we determined that the information removed by the threat actor may have contained some of your personal information, including your full name, address, date of birth, phone number, provider name(s), date(s) of service, and/or hospital department(s). Your philanthropic giving history, such as donation dates and amounts, may have also been removed by the threat actor. This incident does not impact your Social Security number, which we do not collect, and your financial account information and/or payment card information were also not exposed. The Inova electronic health record system was not impacted by this incident.

What We Are Doing
Upon learning of the issue, we commenced an immediate and thorough investigation. That investigation is still ongoing. As part of our investigation, in addition to demanding detailed information from Blackbaud about the nature and scope of the incident, we engaged cybersecurity professionals experienced in handling these types of incidents.

What Blackbaud is Doing
Blackbaud has assured us that they closed the vulnerability that allowed the incident and that they are enhancing their security controls and conducting ongoing efforts against incidents like this in the future. According to Blackbaud, there is no evidence to believe that any data will be misused, disseminated, or otherwise made publicly available. Blackbaud indicates that it has hired a third-party team of experts, including a team of forensics accountants, to continue monitoring for any such activity. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, we want to make you aware of the incident.

2. Placing a Security Freeze on Your Credit File
If you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a security freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. A security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. You may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:

Equifax Security Freeze
PO Box 105788
Atlanta, GA 30348
https://www.freeze.equifax.com
1-800-349-9960

Experian Security Freeze
PO Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013
http://experian.com/freeze
1-888-397-3742

TransUnion Security Freeze
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19016
http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze
1-888-909-8872

In order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

If your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name, or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the city in which you currently reside.

3. Obtaining a Free Credit Report
Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. Identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. Verify all information is correct. If you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

4. Additional Helpful Resources
Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many creditors will want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You may also file a complaint with the FTC by contacting them on the web at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338), or by mail at Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. In addition, you may obtain information from the FTC about fraud alerts and security freezes.

NOTE: The above-referenced protections may not be available to minor children or those without credit files. If this notice letter is addressed to a minor child or an individual without a credit file, we recommend that you contact the consumer reporting agencies to determine what steps, if any, you should take to safeguard the addressee's information.

Dear <<First Name >> <<Last Name>>,

BMB Associates (the Company) recently learned of a data incident which may have resulted in unauthorized access or acquisition of your personal information. We are providing this notice to inform you of the incident so you can take steps to protect you and minimize the possibility of misuse of your information. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and assure you we are working diligently to resolve this incident.

What Happened

On or about March 16, 2020, the Company discovered some clients had IRS E-file rejections. Based on our investigation, the e-filing rejections were due to fraudulent tax filings by an unauthorized third party who was able to compromise the Company's Intuit ProSeries service and create a guest account. The Company's IT team was able to discover the hidden guest account and was able to remove it on April 2, 2020.

What Information Was Involved

The Company cannot confirm specifically what information, if any, was compromised by the unauthorized person/s. However, the data elements involved in your tax return may include your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, SSN, financial account information. This may also include your spouse and dependent(s) name and SSN. If applicable, we also have sent a separate notice to the affected spouse and/or dependent(s) but please share this letter with them as well.

What We Are Doing

Immediately upon discovering the incident, The Company commenced an investigation to determine its scope and identify those affected. We hired a third-party IT company to investigate our system and they determined that the unauthorized person/s created a guest account within the Company's Intuit ProSeries. The Company immediately deleted the unauthorized guest account and changed all of its passwords. Additionally, we have reported the incident to the Sacramento Valley Hi-Tech Crimes Unit, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). To our knowledge, only a small number of our clients have been affected by this incident, however, we are notifying all of our clients in the abundance of caution. The Company treats all personal information in a confidential manner and is proactive in the careful handling of such information. The Company continues to assess and modify its privacy and data security policies and procedures to prevent similar situations from occurring. We also are assisting affected clients with any IRS filings they need to make to report a fraudulent 2019 filing of their Form 1040.

What You Should Do to Protect Your Personal Information

We recommend you remain vigilant and consider taking one or more of the following steps to avoid identity theft, obtain additional information, and protect your personal information:

1. We recommend you closely monitor your financial accounts and access resources concerning identity theft, such as information the Internal Revenue Services has published at: http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Identity-Protection, and well as https://www.irs.gov/uac/Taxpayer-Guide-to-Identity-Theft. As discussed in the Taxpayer Guide to Identity Theft, IRS Form 14039 can be filed with the IRS to report potential identity theft concerning your federal taxes. You also may want to check with the state(s) in which you file.

2. Contacting the nationwide credit-reporting agencies as soon as possible to:

Add a fraud alert statement to your credit file at all three national credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. This statement alerts creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. Once the fraud alert is added to your credit report, all creditors should contact you prior to establishing any account in your name. You only need to contact one of the three agencies listed below; your request will be shared with the other two agencies. To place a 90-day fraud alert on your credit file, log into the Equifax Member Center and click on the fraud alert tab, visit www.fraudalerts.equifax.com or call the auto fraud line at 1-877-478-7625, and follow the simple prompts. This fraud alert will remain on your credit file for 90 days.

Place a security freeze on your credit account. This means that your credit account cannot be shared with potential creditors. A security freeze can help prevent new account identity theft. If you would like to request a security freeze be placed on your account, you must write by certified or overnight mail (see addresses below) to each of the three credit reporting agencies, or through the electronic or Internet method made available by the credit reporting agencies. In your request, you also must include (documentation for both the spouse and the victim must be submitted when requesting for the spouse's credit report) (i) a copy of either the police report or case number documenting the identity theft, if you are a victim of identity theft; (ii) your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.,) address, Social Security number, and date of birth; (iii) if you have moved in the past 5 years, the addresses where you have lived over the prior 5 years; (iv) proof of current address such as a current utility bill or phone bill; (v) a photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and, if applicable (vi) payment by check, money order or credit card (Visa, Master Card, American Express or Discover cards only.)

Remove your name from mailing lists of pre-approved offers of credit for approximately six months.

RE: Notice of Data Breach

Dear Constituent,

We are writing to inform you of a recent data breach involving Blackbaud, Inc. Blackbaud, Inc. provides donor relations database software systems for Episcopal Community Services (ECS). On July 16, 2020, ECS was notified by Blackbaud, Inc., one of our third-party service providers, of a security incident. Blackbaud discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. After discovering the attack, the service provider's cyber security team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking their system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from their system. However, before locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a backup file containing some constituent information. This occurred at some point beginning on February 7, 2020, and could have been in there intermittently until May 20, 2020.

It is important to note that the cybercriminal did not access data like credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. However, Blackbaud has informed us that donor information such as contact information, names, email addresses, mailing addresses, and giving history could have been a part of the data breach.

Blackbaud, Inc. paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed. Based on the nature of the incident, their research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, Blackbaud has no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Please note that this breach only affected information on Blackbaud's servers for ECS donors and has no impact on ECS clients or programs.

We are notifying you so that you can take immediate action to protect yourself. Ensuring the safety of our constituents' data is of the utmost importance to us. As part of their ongoing efforts to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, Blackbaud has already implemented several changes that will protect your data from any subsequent incidents. First, Blackbaud's teams were able to quickly identify the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and took swift action to fix it. They have confirmed through testing by multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, that their fix withstands all known attack tactics. Additionally, they are accelerating efforts to further harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms. You can read more about the security breach on Blackbaud's website: https://www.blackbaud.com/security-incident

As a best practice, we recommend you remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities.

We apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience it may cause you. For additional information, please refer to our website at: ecscalifornia.org/blackbaud. Should you have any further questions or concerns about this incident and/or the protections available to you, please do not hesitate to contact me at amuir@ecscalifornia.org.

Sincerely,

Andra Muir
Director of Development	The breach was due to a ransomware attack by a cybercriminal on Blackbaud, Inc's servers that contained ECS donor data including contact information, names, email addresses, mailing addresses, and giving history. The cybercriminal was able to remove a copy of the data before being discovered and stopped by Blackbaud, Inc.'s cyber security team, third-party forensics experts, and law enforcement. While Blackbaud, Inc. has paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed and has implemented changes to prevent further attacks, the breach was due to hacking.

Fraud Alerts:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes:

You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies using the contact information above.	The FBI notified California Dialysis Management Services (CDMS) that an individual had been arrested in possession of some CDMS documents containing personal information of some of their employees. CDMS hired a forensic firm to investigate, and has arranged complimentary identity protection services for impacted individuals.

Dear <<Name 1>>:

Greenworks Tools (Greenworks) is writing to inform you of a recent event that may impact the privacy of some of your payment information. We wanted to provide you with information about the event, our response, and steps you may wish to take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud.

What Happened?

On or about June 3, 2020, Greenworks discovered suspicious activity related to its online e-commerce website, www.greenworkstools.com. Greenworks immediately began working with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and what information may have been affected. Greenworks also took steps to implement additional procedures to further protect the security of customer debit and credit card information on our website. You can safely and securely use your payment card on our website. On August 14, 2020, the third-party forensic investigators confirmed that Greenworks was the victim of a sophisticated cyber-attack that may have resulted in a compromise to some of our customers' credit and debit cards used to make purchases on our e-commerce website between July 14, 2019, and June 30, 2020. Greenworks took steps to confirm the identity of the customers whose personally identifiable information may have been impacted. If you entered your payment card information onto our e-commerce website between July 14, 2019, and June 30, 2020, your payment card information may have been impacted. On August 20, 2020, our investigation identified the customers that may have been affected by this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

Through the third-party forensic investigation, we confirmed on August 14, 2020, that malware may have stolen credit or debit card data from some credit and debit cards used on our website, www.greenworkstools.com, between July 14, 2019, and June 30, 2020.

STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Monitor Accounts

In general, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven (7) years.

Dear Rocklin Unified School District Families,

We are writing to inform you about a data security breach that occurred on NutriKids-NutriLink, the District's student lunch data program that stores some student and parent information regarding nutrition services for Rocklin Unified School District. We are one of many districts using NutriKids-NutriLink that was affected by this breach. RUSD has been a customer of NutriKids-NutriLink for many years, and in that time has had no unauthorized access or data breaches with this software. We do not believe there is any reason to be alarmed or unduly concerned, but we wanted you to be informed about what happened.

Timeline with information provided to us from NutriKids-NutriLink:

On September 17, 2020, we were informed by a Rocklin Unified Parent that there was a bug in the NutriLink software that may allow unauthorized access to the NutriKids-NutriLink system. The initial report was focused on NutriKids-NutriLink Databases where families can look up information on their student(s), which we do use and Link to through our district website. Following the steps provided, we were able to confirm the ability to access student information and reported it immediately to NutriKids-NutriLink. On September 18, we were able to speak with NutriLinks COO Brent England who verified they were able to fix the bug and remove the ability to gain access through the portal.

This breach may have revealed Student First Name, Last Name, Student ID Numbers, and Free or Reduced Lunch Status. However, having spoken with Mr. England, we were able to confirm that no other data elements were impacted as a result of this incident. Social security numbers, credit card data, or other personal information is not kept in our NutriKids-NutriLink database.

We have submitted Data Security Breach notifications with the California Office of the Attorney General as required by California Civil Code s.1798.29(e) and s.1798.82(f) and will continue to monitor this issue. While there is no evidence to suggest that your specific data was misused, out of an abundance of caution, we have removed the link to the NutriKids portal from our district website and are awaiting further information from NutriLinks as to the scope of the data that was exposed.

We have no reason to believe that any data was accessed revealing sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. Rocklin Unified School District does not keep this type of information associated with your NutriKids-NutriLink account. Nevertheless, if you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the Federal Trade Commission's site at IdentityTheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

For links and more information, please visit www.rocklinusd.org/Data-Breach. Here you will also see updated information on the actions NutriKids-NutriLink is taking to prevent this from happening to our school district and others in the future. If you have any questions, including how to reset your password, please email safedata@rocklinusd.org, and one of our RUSD Technology Services experts will respond and help you in a timely manner.

Thank you,

Rocklin Unified School District	The data breach was caused by a bug in the NutriLink software that allowed unauthorized access to the NutriKids-NutriLink system, which stored student and parent information regarding nutrition services for the Rocklin Unified School District. This was fixed by NutriLink, and while some student information may have been revealed, no sensitive information such as social security numbers or credit card data was accessed. The breach was caused by an outside party or malware.

Dear [Name],

Notice of Data Breach

FabFitFun values your membership in our community and respects the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to let you know about a recent data security incident that may involve your personal information. We previously sent an email regarding this incident and are providing this notice to potentially affected members to call their attention to steps they can take to help protect themselves. We take the security of personal information very seriously, and sincerely regret any concern this incident may cause.

What Happened?

Our technical team recently discovered that an unauthorized third party inserted malicious code on portions of our website that may have enabled them to capture certain information in connection with customer sign-ups. Based on our forensic investigation, this incident concerns the new member sign-up pages of our website during the period between April 26, 2020, and May 14, 2020, and between May 22, 2020, and August 3, 2020.

Although we believe that only a subset of members who signed up during this period were affected, we are notifying everyone that signed up during this timeframe as a precaution.

What Information was Involved?

This incident would have involved emails and FabFitFun passwords for customers that signed up using PayPal or Apple Pay. For customers using credit or debit cards, the information involved would also have included name, address, payment card account number, card expiration date, and card verification code. Please note that because we do not collect highly sensitive personal information like Social Security Numbers, this type of information was not affected by this incident.

What We are Doing

We took steps to address and contain this incident promptly after it was discovered. As soon as our technical team identified the issue, we removed the malicious code and took steps to secure our website with the help of forensic cybersecurity experts engaged to assist with our investigation. We have also reported the matter to law enforcement and are cooperating with the investigation.

We are writing to inform you of a recent incident involving Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud), a third-party vendor that Joslin Diabetes Center (Joslin) uses for database assistance in donor relations and fundraising operations. On July 16, 2020, Joslin received notification from Blackbaud of a cyber incident that Blackbaud uncovered in May 2020. The confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care are among our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously.

Upon receiving notice of the cyber incident, Joslin immediately began an investigation to better understand the nature and scope of the incident and any impact on Joslin's data. This notice provides information about the Blackbaud incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

Blackbaud reported that, in May 2020, two months before notifying Joslin, it discovered a ransomware incident that resulted in encryption of certain Blackbaud systems. Blackbaud reported the incident to law enforcement and worked with forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incident. Blackbaud notified its customers, including Joslin, that a cybercriminal may have accessed or acquired certain Blackbaud customer data. Blackbaud reported that the data was potentially exported by the threat actor before Blackbaud locked the cybercriminal out of its environment on May 20, 2020. According to Blackbaud, the data was destroyed, and they do not believe that any data was or will be misused, disseminated, or otherwise be made publicly available. Blackbaud further stated that this belief has been corroborated by outside experts and law enforcement.

Joslin has worked diligently to gather further information from Blackbaud to understand the incident. Our investigation determined that the involved Blackbaud systems may have contained your name, date of birth, treatment date, treatment location, and physician name. We have not received any information from Blackbaud that your information was specifically accessed or acquired by the cybercriminal. It is important to note the Joslin data hosted by Blackbaud did not include any financial account information or social security numbers.

Your private information and its security are of the utmost importance to Joslin. We are reviewing our existing policies and procedures regarding our third-party vendors and are working with Blackbaud to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future.

While we have no reason to believe there are any specific actions you need to take in this situation, we encourage you to review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information. There you will find general information on what you can do to help protect your personal information.

We understand that you may have questions about the Blackbaud incident that are not addressed in this letter.

Dear [Customer Name]:

At U.S. Bank, we value your confidence in us and place the privacy and security of your information as a top priority. We are writing to let you know about an event that occurred at a U.S. Bank location, which included some of your personal information.

What happened:

On July 30, 2020, a computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. Since the event, we have been focused on identifying who was impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

What information was involved:

The information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name and account number. At this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you or your account.

What are we doing:

We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.

What you can do: Free fraud alert information

We recommend that you place a Fraud Alert on your credit file. Fraud Alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. A Fraud Alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: Trans Union, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately.

Under federal law, you are also entitled to one free credit report once every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 877.322.8228 or make a request online at annualcreditreport.com.

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

When a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent.

You may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze. A fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. Contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. A security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: Notice of Data Breach

Vermont Student Assistance Corporation (VSAC) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect the security of some of your information. On July 16, 2020, VSAC received notice that one of its third-party vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud), suffered a cyber incident. Blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to many non-profit organizations, including VSAC. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we are providing you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect yourself, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

In May 2020, Blackbaud experienced a ransomware incident that impacted certain systems within the Blackbaud environment. As a result of this incident, certain Blackbaud systems were encrypted and a Blackbaud database backup file including VSAC data was removed from the Blackbaud environment by an unauthorized actor. While Blackbaud's investigation was able to determine that the backup file was removed between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020, their investigation was unable to confirm exactly when this occurred. As a result, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain information contained within the backup database. Upon learning of this incident, VSAC immediately began an investigation to determine the full nature and scope of the event and what, if any, VSAC data may have been impacted. On or about August 7, 2020, VSAC's investigation determined that the backup database may have contained personal information.

What Information Was Involved?

While Blackbaud reports that information was accessed, Blackbaud was unable to confirm what, if any, specific sensitive information was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor. Blackbaud has also represented to us that they have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Regardless, out of an abundance of caution, VSAC is notifying you of this incident because you are or were a customer or client of VSAC, and information related to you was potentially present in the database at the time of this incident. Our investigation determined that the information related to you included your name and Social Security number. To date, VSAC has not received any reports of actual or attempted misuse of your information.

Dear Sample A Sample:

What Are We Doing?

As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information in our care, we are working to review our existing policies and procedures regarding our third-party vendors and are working with Blackbaud to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future.

We are also notifying state and federal regulators, as	The breach was caused by a ransomware attack suffered by VSAC's third-party vendor, Blackbaud, resulting in unauthorized access to VSAC's data.

Dear [First Name] [Middle Name] [Last Name] [Suffix],

EyeMed manages vision benefits on behalf of your current or former employer's vision plan (Covered Entity). EyeMed takes the privacy and confidentiality of your information very seriously. We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and steps you can take in response.

What happened?
On July 1, 2020, EyeMed discovered that an unauthorized individual gained access to an EyeMed email mailbox and sent phishing emails to email addresses contained in the mailbox's address book. On the same day, EyeMed took immediate action to block the unauthorized individual's access to the mailbox and secured the mailbox. EyeMed immediately launched an investigation into the incident and engaged a cybersecurity firm to assist in its efforts. It was determined that the unauthorized individual first gained access to the mailbox on June 24, 2020, and that access terminated on July 1, 2020. EyeMed initially notified Covered Entity of possible impact on July 30, 2020, and confirmed impact to Covered Entity's members on August 14, 2020.

What information was involved?
The mailbox contained information about individuals who formerly or currently receive vision benefits through EyeMed. Although EyeMed could not fully determine whether, and to what extent, if any, the unauthorized individual viewed or copied personal information, it is possible that personal information was viewed or acquired by the unauthorized individual. Following a detailed analysis and review of all potentially compromised emails and files, EyeMed identified the names of all individuals who were impacted, as well as the type of information included in those files. Personal information that may have been accessed could include the following types of information: [Impacted Data].

What we are doing:
EyeMed is committed to safeguarding your personal information and has taken immediate steps to enhance the protections that were already in place before this incident. In addition to the investigation, EyeMed made changes to how authorized individuals access the EyeMed network and required immediate complex password changes to all our employee accounts. EyeMed is also reinforcing and providing additional mandatory security awareness training. To help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring services at no cost to you for two (2) years.

We encourage you to remain vigilant by regularly reviewing your financial statements, credit reports, and Explanations of Benefits (EOBs) from your health insurers for any unauthorized activity. If you identify services that you did not receive or accounts, charges, or withdrawals that you did not authorize, you should immediately contact and report to the involved company and to credit reporting agencies. Please also review the enclosed Additional Resources section included with this letter. This section describes additional steps you can take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear [Name],

We are writing to inform you about a data breach of your Personal Health Information (PHI) from our online COVID statistics database.

What Happened?
The breach occurred due to unauthorized access into our database by at least one member of the public. We became aware of this breach on July 28, 2020, and as required by law, we are notifying potentially affected individuals as soon as possible while protecting the integrity of the ongoing forensic investigation. Although it is unclear whether your personal health information was accessed, we are notifying you of the possibility.

What Information was Involved?
The unsecured information could include your first and last name, date of birth, gender, race, region in which you live, COVID-19 test information, and clinical notes from the time period between April 9, 2020, and July 14, 2020. Please note that none of the types of information that typically are used for identity theft (such as Social Security Number, financial account numbers, etc.) was among the information that was potentially accessed.

What We are Doing?
Upon learning of the breach, we took immediate steps to secure the information stored in our online database. Access from the outside has been successfully and completely prevented going forward.

What You Can Do?
We do not believe it is necessary for you to take steps to protect yourself from additional information breach harm (such as identity theft) because the information did not contain financial data, social security numbers, or other data that could lead to identity theft. However, if you have any questions or concerns about the above, please call (844) 794-0142.

We deeply apologize for this and any inconvenience it may have caused.

Whether or not you enroll in credit monitoring, we recommend that you place a Fraud Alert on your credit file. Fraud Alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent.

Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately.

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

Dear Friend,

We are writing to inform you that Blackbaud, one of the League of American Orchestras' database vendors, recently notified us of a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. Blackbaud has assured us that this breach did not include access to any credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. Based on the nature of the incident, their research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, Blackbaud concluded that there is no reason to believe that any data was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

Despite Blackbaud's assurances that there is a very low risk that any of your information could be misused, the League of American Orchestras takes the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. We are therefore contacting you to explain the incident and to provide you with additional steps you can take to protect yourself.

What Happened:

Blackbaud, which works with many nonprofits and educational institutions to support their development and donor engagement activities, recently notified us of a security incident. You may have received a similar email about this incident from other nonprofits or universities whose data Blackbaud stewards. At this time, we understand that Blackbaud discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. After discovering the attack, Blackbaud's Cyber Security team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, expelled the cybercriminal from their system. Blackbaud indicated, however, that the cybercriminal did remove a copy of a backup file containing some of your information before being locked out of the system. A full description of the incident is available on Blackbaud's website at https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident.

What Information Was Involved:

The cybercriminal did not access your credit card information, bank account information, or social security number. However, Blackbaud has determined that the file removed may have contained personal information, such as your physical and email addresses, telephone numbers, demographic information, and a history of your relationship with our organization, including donation dates and amounts. Blackbaud informed us that the company paid the cybercriminal's demand and received confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed. As noted above, Blackbaud concluded that there is no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, that the data was or will be misused, or that the data will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What Blackbaud and the League are Doing:

The League is notifying you out of an abundance of caution. Ensuring the safety of our constituents' data is of the utmost importance to us. Blackbaud has assured us of its commitment to prevent future cyber theft, having already implemented several changes to better protect your data. Blackbaud's teams were able to quickly identify the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and took swift action to fix it. The company has confirmed through testing by multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, that its fix withstands all known attack tactics. Additionally, Blackbaud is accelerating their efforts to further harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

What You Can Do:

Although we currently have no reason to believe that your information will be misused, we encourage you to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us, to Blackbaud, and to the proper law enforcement authorities. We sincerely apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience it may cause you. Should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us by email at securitybreach@americanorchestras.org or by phone at 646-822-4098.

Sincerely,

NOTICE OF DATA SECURITY INCIDENT

We are writing to tell you about a recent data security incident that may have resulted in the unauthorized acquisition of personal information you provided when using our website to make online purchases. We take this matter very seriously because we know how important your personal information is to you. We are providing this notice to you as a precautionary measure, to inform you and to explain steps that you can take to protect your information.

What Happened

On August 20, 2020, St. Paul Center received notice from a payment processing vendor that our website (http://www.stpaulcenter.com) was a common point of purchase for some unauthorized payment card transactions and that there may have been a possible compromise of our website. We investigated to find out what happened, to prevent something like this from happening again, and to provide notice to potentially affected individuals.

We determined that a cyber-criminal installed malware in software that we use to enhance our online purchasing. The malware permitted the unauthorized collection or scraping of certain payment card data provided through the website. We believe the incident only involved customers who made purchases or donations on the website between March 3, 2020, and August 9, 2020. On August 26, 2020, we determined that the incident may have involved your personal information because you made a payment card purchase or donation using our website during that time period.

What Information Was Involved

Once we determined that there may have been unauthorized acquisition of payment card information, we reviewed our purchase records to find out who may have been affected and where those people resided. The information may have included your name, address, email address, telephone number, and payment card number, along with the accompanying CVV code, pin or expiration date.

What We Are Doing About It

When we discovered this incident, our technical experts identified and corrected the issue, effectively closing the point of entry for the website malware. To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we conducted an extensive internal audit to all systems and have implemented more stringent, ongoing processes for identifying and eliminating vulnerabilities. We are also providing notice of this incident to appropriate state regulators, consistent with our compliance obligations and responsibilities.

What You Can Do

We recommend that you remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft by monitoring your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. Report any incidents of suspected identity theft to your local law enforcement and state Attorney General. If you believe your payment card information may have been compromised, you should consider contacting your payment card company and/or financial institution and request that the card be canceled. We strongly recommend that you review the information provided at the end of this letter, entitled More Information about Identity Theft and Ways to Protect Yourself and State-Specific Information.

For More Information

If you have any questions or need more information, please call us, toll-free, at 1-888-487-2114, Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST.

We know that this situation is frustrating to you, and we deeply regret this incident. Please know we take your support, and your trust, very seriously. We hope our actions moving forward will demonstrate this.

Very truly yours,

Anthony Puorro, Chief Financial Officer

Re: Cedar County, Iowa Board of Supervisors Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

McDonald Hopkins PLC represents the Board of Supervisors for Cedar County, Iowa (Cedar County). I am writing to provide a voluntary notification of an incident at Cedar County that may affect the security of personal information of approximately four hundred and ninety-three (493) Iowa residents. Two-hundred seventeen (217) of these individuals are being notified under HIPAA and Cedar County has reported to OCR, while the remainder are being notified under Iowa state law. Despite the fact that we are notifying fewer than five hundred (500) Iowa residents, we wanted to voluntarily notify you of this event in the spirit of our relationship. Cedar County's investigation is ongoing, and this communication will be supplemented with any new or significant facts or findings subsequent to this submission, if any.

Cedar County was the target of an email phishing campaign that resulted in an unauthorized individual gaining access to a limited number of Cedar County employee email accounts. Upon learning of the issue, Cedar County secured the accounts and commenced a prompt and thorough investigation. As part of that investigation, Cedar County has been working very closely with external cybersecurity professionals experienced in handling these types of incidents. After an extensive forensic investigation and manual email review, Cedar County discovered on September 10, 2020 that the email accounts that were accessed between August 18, 2019 and December 3, 2019 contained personal information of the affected residents including Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers or state ID card numbers, financial account numbers, credit or debit card information, and biometric information.

To date, Cedar County has no evidence that any of the information has been misused. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, Cedar County wanted to inform you (and the affected residents) of the incident and to explain the steps it is taking to help safeguard the affected residents against identity fraud. Cedar County is providing the affected residents with written notification of this incident commencing on or about October 8, 2020 in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto. Cedar County is offering the affected residents whose Social Security numbers were impacted complimentary one-year memberships with a credit monitoring service. Cedar County is advising the affected residents about the process for placing fraud alerts and/or security freezes on their credit files and obtaining free credit reports. The affected residents are also being provided with the contact information for the consumer reporting agencies, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Iowa Attorney General.

At Cedar County, protecting the privacy of personal information is a top priority. Cedar County is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information in its possession and has taken many precautions to safeguard it. Cedar County continually evaluates and modifies its practices to enhance the security and privacy of the personal information.

Should you have any questions concerning this notification, please contact me at 248-220-1354 or jgiszczak@mcdonaldhopkins.com.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Very truly yours,

Dear Friend,

We are writing to inform you that Blackbaud, one of the League of American Orchestras' database vendors, recently notified us of a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. Blackbaud has assured us that this breach did not include access to any credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. Based on the nature of the incident, their research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, Blackbaud concluded that there is no reason to believe that any data was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

Despite Blackbaud's assurances that there is a very low risk that any of your information could be misused, the League of American Orchestras takes the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. We are therefore contacting you to explain the incident and to provide you with additional steps you can take to protect yourself.

What Happened

Blackbaud, which works with many nonprofits and educational institutions to support their development and donor engagement activities, recently notified us of a security incident. You may have received a similar email about this incident from other nonprofits or universities whose data Blackbaud stewards. At this time, we understand that Blackbaud discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. After discovering the attack, Blackbaud's Cyber Security team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, expelled the cybercriminal from their system. Blackbaud indicated, however, that the cybercriminal did remove a copy of a backup file containing some of your information before being locked out of the system. A full description of the incident is available on Blackbaud's website at https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident.

What Information Was Involved

The cybercriminal did not access your credit card information, bank account information, or social security number. However, Blackbaud has determined that the file removed may have contained personal information, such as your physical and email addresses, telephone numbers, demographic information, and a history of your relationship with our organization, including donation dates and amounts. Blackbaud informed us that the company paid the cybercriminals' demand and received confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed. As noted above, Blackbaud concluded that there is no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, that the data was or will be misused, or that the data will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What Blackbaud and the League are Doing

The League is notifying you out of an abundance of caution. Ensuring the safety of our constituents' data is of the utmost importance to us. Blackbaud has assured us of its commitment to prevent future cyber theft, having already implemented several changes to better protect your data. Blackbaud's teams were able to quickly identify the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and took swift action to fix it. The company has confirmed through testing by multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, that its fix withstands all known attack tactics. Additionally, Blackbaud is accelerating their efforts to further harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

What You Can Do

Although we currently have no reason to believe that your information will be misused, we encourage you to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us, to Blackbaud, and to the proper law enforcement authorities.

We sincerely apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience it may cause you. Should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us by email at securitybreach@americanorchestras.org or by phone at 646-822-4098.

Sincerely,

Marc Martin

Substitute Notice of Data Breach

Dear valued member of the Carnival Cruise Line family,

We are writing to inform you about a recent cyber event that occurred on August 15, 2020. Unauthorized third-party access to portions of our information technology systems was detected, and we acted quickly to shut down the intrusion, restore operations, and prevent further unauthorized access. We also engaged a major cybersecurity firm to investigate the matter and notified law enforcement and appropriate regulators of the event.

While the investigation is ongoing, early indications are that in early August an unauthorized third-party gained access to certain personal information relating to some of our guests, employees, and crew. For individuals who sailed with us, the information impacted may include the data routinely collected during the guest travel booking process, during the casino experience, or at the time of employment. That information may include names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and dates of birth. The investigation into the specific data impacted is ongoing, but in some limited instances, we anticipate additional information impacted may include data such as Social Security numbers, health information, or other personal information.

Working with our cybersecurity consultants, we took steps to recover our files and have evidence indicating a low likelihood of the data being misused. We are working as quickly as possible to identify the guests, employees, crew, and other individuals whose information may have been impacted. We expect to complete this process within the next 30-60 days and will then send notifications to potentially affected individuals whose current contact information is available to the company. Along with those individual notices, affected individuals will be offered complimentary credit monitoring, as appropriate.

We have issued a news release, posted website notices, and established a dedicated call center to answer questions regarding the event. When the investigation is complete, callers may confirm whether or not their information was affected. Additional information about the event is available at www.carnival.com. The call center is available toll-free in the U.S. at +1. 888.905.0687, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), Monday through Friday. Individuals outside the U.S. may email questions to cruisedataevent@cyberscout.com, and request that a call center representative respond back by phone.

As part of our ongoing operations, we are continuing to review security and privacy policies and procedures and implementing changes when needed to enhance information security and privacy controls.

It is always a good idea to remain vigilant against threats of identity theft or fraud. You can do this by regularly reviewing and monitoring your account statements and credit history for any signs of unauthorized transactions or activity. While we have no reason to suspect that your information is being misused, if you ever suspect that you are the victim of identity theft or fraud, you can contact your local police.

For additional information about how to protect yourself, please visit the resources provided for Australian, Canadian, U.K., and U.S. residents in the appendices below.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at the U.S. toll-free number +1 888.905.0687 between the hours of 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), Monday through Friday.

At Georgia Southern University, we understand the importance of protecting and securing the personal information we maintain. We are writing to notify you of a security incident experienced by one of our vendors, Blackbaud. This notice explains the incident, measures we and Blackbaud have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified us that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files removed from its systems had been destroyed. The time period of unauthorized access was between February 7 to May 20, 2020. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the Blackbaud services we use and the information provided by Blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. On September 8, 2020, we determined that the backup files contained certain information pertaining to you.

What Information Was Involved?

The backup file involved contained your name, Social Security number, and donor profile in fields that may have been viewable to the unauthorized person. Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What You Can Do.

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity, as well reviewing the additional information provided in the following pages.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Terminix and our former affiliate, ServiceMaster, take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously, and we strive to maintain transparency in how we handle your data. It is for this reason we are reaching out today.

What Happened?

On September 16th, the company discovered that a teammate had responded to a phishing scam, which allowed hackers to gain access to the teammate's Office 365 account and cause the teammate's emails to be auto-forwarded from the teammate's inbox to an external email account controlled by the hackers. The auto-forwarding began on September 10th and continued until September 22nd. Please note that this breach involved a hack into Office 365 at the cloud level and there was no malware or malicious software that infected the company's internal systems.

What Information was Involved?

Our review of compromised emails revealed that one email included a file which contained the name, social security number, date of birth, employment dates, 401K balance, and the name of our 401K provider for 14,708 current and former teammates across the United States. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it is possible that thieves can use it for identity theft. We do not know if the information has been used at this time. We are sending this notice to both Terminix and ServiceMaster teammates because these events took place before the completion of the sale of ServiceMaster brands, when everyone receiving this notice was employed under the ServiceMaster Global Holdings brand.

What We are Doing:

We have taken and continue to take a number of actions in response to the breach. We have disabled the forwarding of the emails and contained the breach. We modified our email filtering and account authorization protocol to help prevent similar data breach incidents. We are communicating to our teammates to be sure everyone is especially diligent regarding any potential scams as we continue to fight the battle with these criminals from repeated phishing attacks. We are requiring teammates to complete the annual security awareness training, and we have issued specialized training to particularly high-risk groups to help them recognize extremely sophisticated phishing attempts. We are working with law enforcement agencies to investigate this cybercrime and are notifying state authorities as well. We've notified the provider of our 401K plans and the major credit agencies. We are continuing to monitor the security of our systems and reinforce messages related to the importance of abiding by proper security and data handling measures.

What You Can Do:

While we currently have no reason to believe any personal information has been misused, for your protection, we have arranged to provide identity theft protection services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert at no cost to you for two years. MyIDCare services include two years of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed ID theft recovery services. With this protection, MyIDCare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised.

We encourage you to contact ID Experts with any questions and to enroll in free MyIDCare services by calling toll-free at 1-833-752-0857 or going to https://app.myidcare.com/account-creations/protect and use the enrollment code shown below.

Please do not attempt to enroll or contact ID Expert's call center before that time. The deadline to enroll is January 11th, 2021.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website.

Dear [Customer Name]:

At U.S. Bank, we value your confidence in us and place the privacy and security of your information as a top priority. We are writing to let you know about an event that occurred at a U.S. Bank location, which included some of your personal information.

What happened:

On July 30, 2020, a computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. Since the event, we have been focused on identifying who may have been impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

What information was involved:

The information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name and account number. At this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you or your account.

What are we doing:

We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. As a precautionary measure, if you would like to receive a new account number, you can do so by calling our Fraud Liaison Center at 877.595.6256 between 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. CT, Monday through Sunday. We can help you close and reopen your account with a new account number at no charge.

What you can do: Free fraud alert information

We recommend that you place a Fraud Alert on your credit file. Fraud Alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. A Fraud Alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately. The contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is:

Equifax

Experian

Free credit report information

Under federal law, you are also entitled to one free credit report once every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 877.322.8228 or make a request online at annualcreditreport.com.

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. Also visit the FTCs website at ftc.gov/idtheft to review their free identity theft resources such as their comprehensive step-by-step guide Identity Theft - A Recovery Plan.

Free credit-security freeze information

You can request a free Security Freeze (aka Credit Freeze) on your credit file by contacting each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies via the channels outlined below. When a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. A credit freeze can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Timberline Billing Service, LLC (Timberline) located at 1801 Fuller Road West Des Moines, IA 50265, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to five hundred eighty-seven (587) Iowa residents. This notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, Timberline does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

This notice is being provided to your office by Timberline on behalf of the below named entity, as Timberline experienced a data event impacting personal information received from and relating to this entity, which is understood to be the data owner of the personal information. The information that may have been impacted by this incident varies by individual and is broken down in relation to each of Timberline's customer school districts on behalf of whom this notification is being submitted:

Council Bluffs Community School District, located at 300 W. Broadway, Suite 1600, Council Bluffs, IA 51503, has 587 impacted Iowa residents. The data involved was name and Social Security number.

Nature of the Data Event

On March 5, 2020, Timberline noticed suspicious activity on its systems. Timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. On March 16, 2020, Timberline notified its data owner clients that it had experienced a security incident and would provide additional information once more was known, including whether any personal information had been subject to unauthorized access or acquisition.

Working with outside computer forensics specialists, Timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed the Timberline network between February 12, 2020 and March 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also claimed to have removed certain information from the Timberline network. However, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information on Timberline's systems was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor, and the unauthorized actor did not provide proof of the data which they purportedly removed.

Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, Timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted to identify any sensitive information present relating to its customer school districts and their students or other related individuals. This review was completed on or about June 10, 2020, and determined that protected health information (PHI), as defined by HIPAA, and/or personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to Timberline's customer school districts was present in files that may have been subject to unauthorized access or acquisition. However, for a significant number of impacted individuals, the review was unable to match the individuals' information with the related customer school district to whom the data belonged.

To address this issue, Timberline undertook a detailed review of both the source documents in which PHI and/or PII identified and its own internal records to identify which school district clients the individuals' information belonged to. On September 2, 2020, Timberline provided notice to its impacted customer school districts with which the impacted individuals' information is associated that this information was impacted by the incident. Timberline offered to provide notice of the incident and identity protection services to individuals, as well as notice to applicable privacy regulators, on behalf of the school districts. Since that time, Timberline continues to work diligently to assist all school districts who wish to accept its offer to coordinate the notifications.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On October 20, 2020, Timberline mailed written notice of this incident to affected individuals on behalf of its above-named customer school district. The number of affected individuals includes five hundred eighty-seven (587) Iowa residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

Upon learning of this incident, Timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant Timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. Timberline reported this incident to law enforcement. Timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of the Timberline systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place, including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

Although there is no indication of misuse of personal information, and Timberline was unable to confirm with certainty that data was accessed or acquired by an unauthorized actor, Timberline is offering 12 months of complimentary identity monitoring services to impacted individuals through Experian. Additionally, Timberline is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. Timberline is providing individuals with information on how to place a	There is no clear information regarding the type of breach that occurred, as the investigation was unable to determine which specific information on Timberline's systems was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor, and it is unknown how the actor gained access to their systems. There is also no clear indication of the nature of unauthorized access or acquisition of data, and whether it was due to hacking, unintentional disclosure, physical loss, or an insider breach. Therefore, as it is unclear what type of breach occurred, the breach is classified as unknown.

To whom it may concern:

In accordance with Iowa Code 715C.1-2, I am writing on behalf of Sam's Club to notify you of a recent data security issue.

On September 24, 2020, Sam's Club learned that in the previous week, an unauthorized party used certain members' login credentials (email address and password) to access their Sam's Club accounts. Based on the company's investigation, Sam's Club believes the credentials the unauthorized party used were stolen from sources unrelated to Sam's Club and were not obtained from Sam's Club. The unauthorized party used these stolen credentials to conduct fraudulent transactions involving certain members' Sam's Club Cash Rewards.

In addition to the login credentials that were stolen from sources outside of the Sam's Club environment, the unauthorized party may have accessed certain information in members' accounts, including names, phone numbers, postal addresses, Sam's Club online membership IDs, membership types, Cash Rewards (balances, amounts earned and spent), and membership expiration dates.

Sam's Club contacted law enforcement and promptly took a number of steps to protect potentially affected members. Within a day of detecting the issue, the company sent emails to these members indicating that Sam's Club had reset their online passwords due to suspicious activity on their accounts. The company is issuing a new Sam's Club membership number to certain affected members. In addition, Sam's Club has implemented certain fraud defense measures with respect to Cash Rewards balances, including placing a temporary hold on any Cash Rewards currently in certain members' accounts. The company continues to monitor for suspicious activity and has encouraged affected members to change their passwords for other online accounts (e.g., email, banking or social media) if they used login credentials similar to those that they used for their Sam's Club membership accounts.

There are approximately 2,616 Iowa residents whose Cash Rewards accounts were affected by this issue. Enclosed for your reference is a draft copy of the notification letter being mailed to these individuals, and Sam's Club has arranged to offer them complimentary identity protection and credit monitoring services.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Very truly yours,

Additionally, there is no mention of physical documents, portable devices or stationary computers being lost or stolen.

Message:

Dear Parents,

Mount Diablo Unified School District (the District) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information, and that of our parents. We are writing to address a recent incident that may have involved your data. This notice explains the incident, protective measures we have taken, and steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

On Monday, September 14, 2020, the District was informed that when certain parents were using the SchoolMessenger mobile application, they were able to view a list of roughly thirty (30) unique names, emails, and phone numbers not associated with their family. After initial verification of the incident, our district immediately contacted Intrado, which is the parent company for SchoolMessenger, to shut down all parent access to the SchoolMessenger application. In addition, together with Intrado, the District is working to investigate the specifics about what took place and how it can be prevented in the future.

What Information Was Involved?

Intrado has notified the District that due to their coding error, the SchoolMessenger application randomly disclosed other parents' and students' contact information (names, email, and phone numbers) to parents accessing their application.

What Are We Doing?

We at Mt. Diablo Unified School District take our responsibility of safeguarding the confidentiality and security of student and parent information very seriously. For that reason, we immediately required Intrado to shut down the SchoolMessenger application, pending resolution of the coding error, and further investigation.

What Can You Do?

Even though we have no evidence that your personal contact information has been misused or was inadvertently released by SchoolMessenger, we want to let you know this incident happened and that we take it very seriously. We will take all steps to ensure student data is always protected and safeguarded by our third-party providers. Thus, the SchoolMessenger application will remain shut until as the District assesses its overall security, and considers alternatives. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions, please call (925) 682-8000 x 4093 or email us at breachconcerns@mdusd.org.

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft. For more information and to contact the FTC, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You may also contact the FTC at: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Credit Reports:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alerts:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes:

You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies using the contact information above.

Re: Information regarding your account ending in XXXX.

Dear [Customer Name]:

At U.S. Bank, we value your confidence in us and place the privacy and security of your information as a top priority. We are writing to let you know about an event that occurred at a U.S. Bank location, which included some of your personal information.

What happened:

On July 30, 2020, a computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. Since the event, we have been focused on identifying who may have been impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

What information was involved:

The information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name and account number. At this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you or your account.

What are we doing:

We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. As a precautionary measure, if you would like to receive a new account number, you can do so by calling our Fraud Liaison Center at 877.595.6256 between 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. CT, Monday through Sunday. We can help you close and reopen your account with a new account number at no charge.

What you can do: Free fraud alert information

We recommend that you place a Fraud Alert on your credit file. Fraud Alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. A Fraud Alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately. The contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is:

Equifax
PO Box 740256
Atlanta, GA 30374

800.525.6285

TransUnion

Experian

Free credit report information

Under federal law, you are also entitled to one free credit report once every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 877.322.8228 or make a request online at annualcreditreport.com.

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. Also visit the FTCs website at ftc.gov/idtheft to review their free identity theft resources such as their comprehensive step-by-step guide Identity Theft - A Recovery Plan.

Free credit-security freeze information

You can request a free Security Freeze (aka Credit Freeze) on your credit file by contacting each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies via the channels outlined below. When a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. A credit freeze can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

Notice of Security Incident

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you that Ascend Clinical, a clinical reference laboratory specializing in testing services for kidney disease, experienced a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. As a patient who has received laboratory testing services from Ascend, we are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident, although we have not received any indication that the information has been used by any unauthorized individual.

What happened?

On or about May 31, 2020, Ascend detected irregularities in its data systems, including some Ascend data that had become encrypted through an unknown source. Upon a thorough investigation, Ascend determined that an unauthorized user had accessed and downloaded Ascend business records, including some personally identifiable information (PII) of Ascend's patients. Under a federal law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), this PII is considered protected health information (PHI). Ascend has notified federal and local law enforcement authorities and retained a leading third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the nature and scope of the incident. Ascend is also in the process of notifying state and federal agencies responsible for enforcing privacy laws, as required by law.

What information was involved?

The individuals behind the data security incident gained access to and downloaded files containing PII and PHI. At no time did the unauthorized users access Ascend's electronic health records, where the majority of Ascend's PHI was stored. The information that may have been compromised includes your name and address, and may also include medical diagnosis, medical conditions, medical record number, medication, medication dosage, and/or your social security number. Please note that this incident did not impact the accuracy of your test results in any way.

What we are doing?

Ascend internal teams worked diligently with forensic consultants to restore and secure the impacted systems. This included the installation of forensic tools on all systems and the isolation of impacted systems until Ascend could confirm that they were secure. Ascend also implemented countermeasures and further upgraded its security systems to prevent future incidents such as this from occurring. Ascend has secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.

We believe that your personal information was involved in the incident. This notice provides important information regarding what happened, what information may have been affected, what measures we are taking, and what you can do in response.

What Happened: The cyber-attack involved the unauthorized access of an email account of an individual associated with <<company 1>>. We became aware of this incident on September 23, 2020, when we were notified that an unauthorized entity successfully sent several spam emails from the affected email account to various email addresses unfamiliar to the account holder. Since this unauthorized entity had access to the account holder's mailbox, it is possible that data contained within the mailbox may have been acquired and disclosed to others. Upon becoming aware of this incident, we took immediate action to secure the account and investigate the incident. As a result of the investigation, we determined that there was unauthorized access to the email account from September 17, 2020, to September 23, 2020, when the account was locked. The affected email account contained information about some of the individuals with whom we have a business relationship, including you.

What Information Was Involved: Although we are still investigating the incident, our current understanding is that your affected personal information includes one or more of the following: your Social Security number, government-issued identification information (such as a driver's license number, passport number, or tax identification number), date of birth, financial account information (such as a bank account number or payment card number), and health information.

What We Are Doing: As soon as we learned of the cyber-attack, we took immediate steps to secure the email account and launch an investigation. We are also reviewing and updating our security practices. In addition, we are providing you with a subscription to credit monitoring and identity theft protection services, as described below.

What You Can Do: As always, we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely.

RE: << b2b_text_1 (Site of Care)>> , a member of Trinity Health:

Notice of Data Breach

At Trinity Health, safety is a top priority including the safety of our patients and donors personal information. In that regard, we are notifying you about a data security incident involving Blackbaud, a vendor that supplies Trinity Health's donor database technology. The data security incident may have impacted certain personal information of donors and certain patients.

What Happened?

On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified Trinity Health and other customers of a cyber-attack involving Blackbaud's network, including ransomware, that impacted certain donor database backup files maintained by Blackbaud, including Trinity Health's donor database. Blackbaud reported the cyberattack occurred between April 18, 2020 - May 16, 2020. Blackbaud reported that based on its investigation, the cybercriminals responsible for the attack could have obtained access to various types of information in the client backup files.

What We Are Doing.

Upon receiving this notice, Trinity Health took immediate steps to begin its own investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive Trinity Health data was potentially impacted. Please note that this attack did not occur within the information systems of Trinity Health or any affiliated Ministry. Unfortunately, a sophisticated attack against Blackbaud circumvented Blackbaud's security measures protecting the information in their care leading to this incident. Trinity Health and its affiliated Ministries take security of your information seriously and makes significant investments in the protection of your information to reduce this type of event from occurring. Trinity and its affiliated Ministries are working with Blackbaud to keep this type of event from occurring again.

What information was involved?

Our forensic investigation determined that some data fields were encrypted and would not be accessible to the cybercriminals. Other fields were not encrypted and could have been accessible to the cybercriminals including information such as: donor relation to patient, patient discharge status, patient insurance and patient department of service. This database information spans from 2000 to 2020.

Your personally identifiable information and protected health information data elements that could have been exposed in the cyberattack are: full name, address, phone numbers, email, <<b2b_text_2(ImpactedData)>> .

Why was patient information in the database?

Limited patient information was included for the purposes of the Trinity Health Grateful Patient Program consistent with the permitted use of limited patient information for fund-raising under HIPAA.

How did Blackbaud secure the data?

Blackbaud reported that they quickly locked out the cybercriminals and resolved the issue. Additional details about the security incident is available by visiting Blackbaud's website at https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident, which includes information about Blackbaud's steps to ensure this issue does not happen again. We continue to work with Blackbaud on the measures they are taking to further secure the information in their care.

We deeply regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any concern or inconvenience you may experience from this notification.

What You Can Do.

As an added precaution, Trinity Health is offering you access to 12 months of free identity monitoring services through Kroll at no cost to you. To activate your membership and start monitoring your personal information please follow the steps in the enclosed Steps You Can Take To Help Protect Personal Information .

For More Information.

Monitor Accounts

Trinity Health encourages you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Under U.S. law you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Experian PO Box 9554 Allen, TX 75013 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com/freeze/center.html
TransUnion P.O. Box 160 Woodlyn, PA 19094 1-888-909-8872 www.transunion.com/credit-freeze
Equifax PO Box 105788 Atlanta, GA 30348-5788 1-800-685-1111 www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services

In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state drivers license or ID card, military identification, etc.);
7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years.

Notice of Data Breach

October 27, 2020

Dear [recipient],

We are writing to notify you that we and many other institutions were recently notified by Blackbaud that it experienced a security incident. This notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other nonprofits. On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified us that it had discovered a ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files removed from its network had been destroyed. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the Blackbaud services we use and the information provided by Blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. On August 18, 2020, we determined that the backup files contained certain information pertaining to you.

What Information Was Involved?

The backup file involved contained your name and indicated the breast cancer diagnosis that you have provided to us. Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused, disseminated, or otherwise made available publicly.

What You Can Do.

Even though there is no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. For more information, including additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in the following pages.

What We Are Doing.

We are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that we, and Blackbaud, are taking in response. Blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based security monitoring.

For More Information.

We regret that this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. Should you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at 855-807-6386 or inquiries@lbbc.org.

Sincerely,

Jean A. Sachs, MSS, MLSP

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that creditors contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

Notice of Security Incident

Dear First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix,

We are writing to you, a patient who has received laboratory testing services from Ascend Clinical (Ascend). Ascend is a clinical reference laboratory specializing in testing services for kidney disease. Ascend experienced a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information.

For this reason, we are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident, although we have not received any indication that the information has been used by any unauthorized individual.

What happened?

On or about May 31, 2020, Ascend detected irregularities in its data systems, including some Ascend data that had become encrypted through an unknown source. Upon a thorough investigation, Ascend determined that an unauthorized user had accessed and downloaded Ascend business records, including some personally identifiable information (PII) of Ascend's patients. Under a federal law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), this PII is considered protected health information (PHI).

Ascend has notified federal and local law enforcement authorities and retained a leading third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the nature and scope of the incident. Ascend is also in the process of notifying state and federal agencies responsible for enforcing privacy laws, as required by law.

What information was involved?

The individuals behind the data security incident gained access to and downloaded files containing PII and PHI. At no time did the unauthorized users access Ascend's electronic health records, where the majority of Ascend's PHI was stored. The information that may have been compromised includes your name and address, and may also include medical diagnosis, medical conditions, medical record number, medication, medication dosage, and/or your social security number. Please note that this incident did not impact the accuracy of your test results in any way.

What we are doing?

Ascend internal teams worked diligently with forensic consultants to restore and secure the impacted systems. This included the installation of forensic tools on all systems and the isolation of impacted systems until Ascend could confirm that they were secure. Ascend also implemented countermeasures and further upgraded its security systems to prevent future incidents such as this from occurring.

Ascend has secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration. Visit https://enroll.idheadquarters.com to take advantage of your identity monitoring services. You have until <<Date>> to activate your identity monitoring services. Membership Number: <<Member ID>> Additional information describing services available to you is included with this letter.

What you can do?

Re: Notice of Technology Management Resources, Inc. Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent the City of Bettendorf, Iowa (the City) located at 1609 State Street, Bettendorf, Iowa 52722, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to five thousand three hundred eighty-seven (5387) Iowa residents that may have been affected by the Technology Management Resources, Inc. (TMR) data security incident. This notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, the City does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, personal jurisdiction, or sovereign immunity.

Nature of the Data Event

TBK Bank (TBK), the City's third-party treasury management services vendor, which includes utility payment processing, has an agreement with TMR to provide Lockbox Payment Processing services for TBK on behalf of the City. On August 27, 2020, the City received notice from TBK of the TMR data security incident. The notice from TBK indicated that an unauthorized actor had gained access to TMR's systems and, consequently, may have been able to access images of checks that were sent to TBK's Lockbox. TBK also provided a list of individuals associated with the City that TMR believed may have been affected by the incident. Upon receipt of the notice, the City immediately commenced an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the underlying event. On September 17, 2020, TBK confirmed that the unauthorized actor had access to the TMR systems from June 1, 2020, to July 1, 2020. Upon using the updated information, the City was able to complete its investigation and confirmed personal information as defined by Iowa Code 715C.1 could have been subject to unauthorized access or acquisition including name, financial account number, and routing number. To date, neither TMR nor TBK have reported any actual or attempted misuse of this information as a result of this incident.

Notice to Iowa Residents

On October 28, 2020, the City provided written notice of the TMR incident to five thousand three hundred eighty-seven (5387) residents. Written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as Exhibit A.

Other Steps Taken and To Be Taken

The City takes the confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information very seriously. After receiving notice from TBK, the City took steps to understand the impact the TMR data security incident had on the City data. Upon confirmation of this information, the City worked to identify those individuals whose information was contained in the check images. As part of its ongoing commitment to the security of information, the City is reviewing its existing policies and procedures regarding our third-party vendors and is working with TBK to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future. The City will also notify other government regulators, as required.

As noted above, the City is notifying potentially affected customers. This notice provides guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. The City is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Contact Information

Should you have any questions regarding this notification or other aspects of the data security event, please contact us at (267) 930-4799.

Very truly yours,

Monitor Your Accounts

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity.

To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

We are writing to inform you that Blackbaud, one of our third-party vendors, experienced a ransomware attack between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020. The attackers accessed and downloaded files containing information about Athenian, some of our alumni, and vendors. Blackbaud initially informed us that the information obtained in the attack was encrypted, and our legal counsel determined that Athenian did not need to provide notice to the affected individuals since their information was not at risk of being misused.

However, on September 29, 2020, Blackbaud provided Athenian with an updated notice stating that some of the exposed information was unencrypted. Blackbaud believes that your social security number was exposed during the incident because they were storing this information in an old version of the Blackbaud software that has since been updated.

Despite Blackbaud's assurances that the information was destroyed, we are notifying you so that you can take immediate action to protect yourself. To that end, Blackbaud is offering Identity Theft Protection services to individuals whose social security numbers were exposed at no cost to you. This service will last for 24 months from the date of enrollment.

In addition to the above steps, Blackbaud intends to encrypt all social security number data in its database by the end of October and delete the old, unused data by the end of this year (2020). Further, Athenian recently instituted a policy of not storing our vendors' social security numbers in Blackbaud's systems.

We recommend that you take advantage of the credit monitoring service above and remain vigilant in protecting your identity. Promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to law enforcement. You should also obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every twelve months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me at 925-362-7262 or ltullo@athenian.org. If you have questions regarding the credit monitoring service from Cyber Scout, please contact them directly at 1-888-682-5911.

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

Free credit-security freeze information

You can request a free Security Freeze (aka Credit Freeze) on your credit file by contacting each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies via the channels outlined below. When a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. A credit freeze can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We represent Carlisle Community School District (Carlisle CSD) regarding a data security incident involving Timberline Billing Services, LLC (Timberline), a company located in Iowa. Carlisle is located at 430 School St., Carlisle, Iowa. Timberline provides Medicaid reimbursement billing services for Medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in Iowa, including Carlisle CSD.

Carlisle CSD takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with Timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. Nature of the incident.

In September 2020, Timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that Timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by Timberline. Carlisle CSD was first notified of this incident by Timberline on September 2, 2020.

On March 5, 2020, Timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. Timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. Working with outside computer forensics specialists, Timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed Timberlines network between February 12, 2020 and March 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from Timberlines network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, Timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. This review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

Based on the investigation, Timberline discovered that the following Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was compromised: Individuals name in combination with their Medicaid Identification Number, Driver License Number and State Identification Number. To date, Timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

Carlisle CSD finished reviewing the list of affected individuals on October 8, 2020 and determined five hundred fifty-four (554) residents were potentially affected. Incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on November 2, 2020 via First Class Mail. A sample copy of the Incident notification letter mailed to potentially affected residents of Iowa is included with this letter at Exhibit A.

3. Steps taken.

Upon learning of this incident, Timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant Timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. Timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. Timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

Timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. Carlisle CSD takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. Carlisle CSD is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by Timberline.

4. Contact information.

Carlisle CSD remains dedicated to protecting its students sensitive personal information. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@WilsonElser.com or 312-821-6164.

Very truly yours,

Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE

We remind you that it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports? There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze? A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	The letter does not provide clear information about how the breach occurred or what kind of data was involved, so it is difficult to narrow down the type of breach more accurately.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We represent Johnston Community School District (Johnston CSD) regarding a data security incident involving Timberline Billing Services, LLC (Timberline), a company located in Iowa. Johnston is located at 5608 Merle Hay Rd, Johnston, Iowa. Timberline provides Medicaid reimbursement billing services for Medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in Iowa, including Johnston CSD.

Johnston CSD takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with Timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. Nature of the incident.

In September 2020, Timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that Timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by Timberline. Johnston CSD was first notified of this incident by Timberline on September 2, 2020.

On March 5, 2020, Timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. Timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. Working with outside computer forensics specialists, Timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed Timberlines network between February 12, 2020 and March 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from Timberlines network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, Timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. This review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

Based on the investigation, Timberline discovered that the following Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was compromised: Individuals name in combination with their Medicaid Identification Number, Driver License Number and State Identification Number. To date, Timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

Johnston CSD finished reviewing the list of affected individuals on October 13, 2020 and determined one thousand six hundred thirty seven (1637) residents were potentially affected. Incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on November 4, 2020 via First Class Mail. A sample copy of the Incident notification letter mailed to potentially affected residents of Iowa is included with this letter at Exhibit A.

3. Steps taken.

Upon learning of this incident, Timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant Timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. Timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. Timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

Timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. Johnston CSD takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. Johnston CSD is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by Timberline.

4. Contact information.

Johnston CSD remains dedicated to protecting its students sensitive personal information. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@WilsonElser.com or 312-821-6164.

Very truly yours,

Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP

Fraud Alert:
You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:
Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:
You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Important Security Notification. Please read this entire letter.

Dear <<Name 1>>:

I am writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by Imperial Community College District (ICCD) that may have involved your personal information as described below. ICCD takes the privacy and security of your information very seriously. While we have no evidence to suggest that any of the impacted information was viewed or misused during this compromise, it is crucial that we be as supportive and transparent as possible. Consequently, below you will find information about steps that can be taken to help protect your information, including complimentary credit monitoring services that we are offering you through TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. I sincerely apologize for any concern that this incident may cause you. Let me reassure you that ICCD is fully committed to supporting you.

What Happened:

On August 6, 2020, ICCD became aware of a potential compromise on our computer network. Upon discovery, ICCD swiftly engaged a third-party forensic company to investigate and we dedicated all of our IT and engineering resources to resolve the problem. Following progress by experts in their thorough investigation, it was ultimately determined that, on August 5, 2020, the administrative account of one employee was hacked and compromised by an unknown source, which allowed unauthorized access onto ICCDs computer network. Upon confirmation of this unauthorized access, ICCDs third-party forensic experts immediately investigated whether the affected databases contained individuals sensitive information. On October 16, 2020, after a thorough investigation, ICCD learned that the unauthorized access may have enabled access to individuals personal information. We diligently began reviewing the list to identify any records that contained information that was considered personally identifiable information (PII) under state and federal laws and to obtain sufficient contact information to provide you with this notification. While we have no reason to believe that any information within the affected email account was actually viewed, collected or misused during this compromise, we are providing this notification to you out of an abundance of caution and so that you may diligently monitor your personal information and resources. We take great care in the security of our technology systems, and regret that this incident has occurred.

What Information Was Involved:

It is important to note, as mentioned above, that there is no evidence to suggest that any personally identifiable information has been viewed or misused. The personal information that could have been viewed by the unauthorized individual(s) may have included your first and last name, in combination with your Social Security number, tax identification number, financial account information, health information, and/or a username and password.

What We Are Doing:

ICCD has taken every step necessary to address the incident and is committed to fully protecting all of the information that you have entrusted to us. Unfortunately, network intrusions have become more common and this incident experienced by ICCD is similar to others experienced by other schools, companies, and industries. Upon learning of this incident, we immediately secured the affected account, reset passwords, and took steps to enhance the security of all information to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. We retained a third-party forensic firm to conduct a thorough investigation and are offering you complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services.

Credit Monitoring:

As a safeguard, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for twelve (12) months provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. Additional information regarding how to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring service is enclosed.

What You Can Do:

In addition to enrolling in the complimentary credit monitoring service detailed within, we recommend that you remain vigilant in regularly reviewing and monitoring all of your account statements and credit history to guard against any unauthorized transactions or activity. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts, please promptly contact your financial institution or company. Additionally, please report any suspicious incidents to local law enforcement and/or your State Attorney General. We have provided additional information below, which contains more information about steps you can take to protect yourself against fraud and identity theft.

For More Information:

Should you have questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at 855-914-4656 between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, Monday through Friday.

Imperial Community College District has no relationship more important or more meaningful than the one we share with you. I want to personally express my deepest regret for any worry or inconvenience that this incident may cause you.

Sincerely,

Martha O. Garcia, Ed.D.

Superintendent/President

Imperial	Based on the information provided, it appears that the data breach was a result of an outside party hacking into the administrative account of an employee.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [Recipient],

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that occurred at Blackbaud, a third-party vendor that provides software and services for fundraising and alumni/donor engagement efforts at non-profits and universities worldwide, including Stetson University.

On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified Stetson University of a ransomware attack on their internal systems. We immediately launched an investigation with the help of external cybersecurity professionals. Blackbaud reported that they identified an attempted ransomware attack on May 20, 2020, and engaged forensic experts and law enforcement to assist in their internal investigation. The investigation concluded that the cybercriminal intermittently removed data from Blackbaud's systems between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020. The cybercriminal removed a backup file containing certain information, which Blackbaud paid to have permanently destroyed.

We discovered on September 4, 2020, that the compromised file may have contained your information. Blackbaud has stated that their teams were able to quickly identify the vulnerability associated with this incident and took action to fix it. They have confirmed through testing by multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, that their fix withstands all known attack tactics. Additionally, they are accelerating their efforts to further harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

While there is no evidence to believe that any data will be misused, disseminated, or otherwise made publicly available, we want to make you aware of the incident out of an abundance of caution. To protect you from potential misuse of your information, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of Experian IdentityWorks Credit 3B.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We represent Dubuque Community School District (Dubuque CSD) regarding a data security incident involving Timberline Billing Services, LLC (Timberline), a company located in Iowa. Dubuque is located at 2300 Chaney Rd, Dubuque, Iowa, 52001. Timberline provides Medicaid reimbursement billing services for Medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in Iowa, including Dubuque CSD. Dubuque CSD takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with Timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. Nature of the incident.

In September 2020, Timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that Timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by Timberline. Dubuque CSD was first notified of this incident by Timberline on September 2, 2020. On March 5, 2020, Timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. Timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. Working with outside computer forensics specialists, Timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed Timberline's network between February 12, 2020, and March 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from Timberline's network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, Timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. This review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised. Based on the investigation, Timberline discovered that the following Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was compromised: Individuals name in combination with their Medicaid Identification Number, Social Security Number, Driver License Number, and State Identification Number. To date, Timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

Dubuque CSD finished reviewing the list of affected individuals on October 16, 2020, and determined four thousand six hundred nineteen (4,619) residents were potentially affected. Incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on November 2, 2020, via First Class Mail.

3. Steps taken.

Upon learning of this incident, Timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant Timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. Timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. Timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location. Timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. Dubuque CSD takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students' information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. Dubuque CSD is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by Timberline.

Dubuque CSD remains dedicated to protecting its students' sensitive personal information. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@WilsonElser.com or 312-821-6164.

Dear <<Name 1>>,

Woodland Unified School District (Woodland) is writing to notify you of an event that may affect the security of some of your personal information. We take the protection and proper use of this information very seriously, and it is important to us that you are made aware of this event.

What Happened?

On April 27, 2020, Woodland was notified by Aeries Software, Inc. (Aeries), a third-party student data management vendor, of a potential data incident affecting Aeries school district clients. While Aeries indicated it found no evidence to suggest that any data was specifically accessed, that type of activity cannot be ruled out with certainty. Aeries also stated that local and federal law enforcement officials were notified of this incident. The notification prompted Woodland to immediately launch an investigation into the nature and scope of the event. The investigation determined that personal information residing in our Aeries Student Information System (SIS) was potentially subject to unauthorized access on or around November 4, 2019. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this information, we undertook a comprehensive review of our Aeries SIS to confirm the type of information it contained and to whom it related. This review was completed on September 15, 2020, and we determined certain information relating to you resided in our Aeries SIS in November 2019 and thus was potentially subject to unauthorized access.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation in this matter confirmed that our Aeries SIS contained your name, physical address, email address, Aeries SIS Username, and password in hashed form.

What Are We Doing?

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. Woodland has strict measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon learning of this incident, we took steps to determine the contents of our Aeries SIS which were affected by the Aeries incident and identify any potentially impacted individuals. We are also working with Aeries to confirm actions they are taking and measures they are putting in place to prevent the reoccurrence of the November 2019 event. Additionally, we have reported this incident to state regulators, as required.

What You Can Do?

Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information. We also encourage you to change your Aeries SIS password.

For More Information.

We recognize that you may have questions not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please call our dedicated assistance line at 888-905-0732 (toll-free), Monday - Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Pacific Time (excluding U.S. national holidays).

Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one (1) free credit report annually from each of the three (3) major credit reporting bureaus. To order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. You may also contact the three (3) major credit bureaus listed below directly to request a free copy of your credit report. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a one-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven (7) years. Should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:

Patient XXX

Xxxxx, CA

Notice of Data Breach

Dear XXX,

At Methodist Hospital of Southern California (MHSC), we take our responsibility to maintain the privacy and security of our patients' personal information very seriously. This commitment includes notifying our patients if we believe their information has potentially been subject to disclosure. This letter is to provide you with such notice.

What Happened?

The Methodist Hospital Foundation (the Foundation) is a nonprofit corporation that is organized to fund charitable funds for the benefit of MHSC.

In accordance with our policies and procedures, and as described in our Notice of Privacy Practices provided to our patients, MHSC provides limited information about our patients to the Foundation, which contracts with Blackbaud Inc., a well-respected provider of cloud and data services for charitable organizations.

On September 9, 2020, we were notified by the Foundation that Blackbaud discovered and stopped a ransomware attack that included the Foundations donor database, as well as those of many other nonprofit organizations. The ransomware attack occurred between February and May 2020, but Blackbaud and the Foundation took time to determine which organizations were impacted before we were notified of the attack.

In its investigation, Blackbaud stated that its cybersecurity team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking Blackbaud's system access. Blackbaud ultimately expelled the cybercriminal from its system. Prior to locking the cybercriminal out, however, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a backup file containing some of the information about you.

Blackbaud stated that they paid the ransom and received confirmation that the cybercriminal had destroyed the copy of the data removed from the system.

What Information Was Involved?

The information we had provided to the Foundation, which was copied and, presumably, destroyed by the cybercriminal may have included your:

- Full name
- Contact information, such as telephone numbers, email address, and mailing address
- Demographic information, such as date of birth and sex
- Medical record number and possibly admission date

We had not provided other health information, such as insurance information or Social Security number, to the Foundation.

Based on the nature of the incident, Blackbaud's research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, Blackbaud has assured us that it has no reason to believe that any data went beyond this cybercriminal or was disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Blackbaud further stated that they have taken additional steps to ensure that the backup file was permanently deleted.

What We Are Doing

Blackbaud has taken several steps in response to this incident. As part of its ongoing efforts to help avoid an event like this from happening in the future, Blackbaud has informed us that it has implemented changes to help protect its system from any future incidents. Since learning of the issue, Blackbaud identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and has taken actions to fix it. Additionally, Blackbaud is accelerating its efforts to further improve its systems through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and other network-based platforms. As an additional safety measure, Blackbaud has indicated that it has hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web for any further misuse of the data.

In response to Blackbaud's notification, MHSC initiated a full investigation once the incident was identified and have taken the necessary steps to prevent a similar event from occurring again, including reviewing and minimizing the sensitive data elements that are provided to the Foundation and/or Blackbaud. In addition, we have reported this incident to the California Department of Public Health.

What You Can Do

I want to emphasize again that Blackbaud has assured us that no Social Security numbers, credit card, bank account, or other information of that nature was compromised. However, we recommend you remain attentive by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely and reporting any suspicious activities.

We also want to make you aware of some precautions you can take to protect yourself against the possibility of becoming a victim of identity theft. Please see the enclosure to learn more about these precautions and services.

I hope this letter provides some assurance regarding this incident and that you will accept our sincere apologies for any undue concern you have experienced as a result of this event. Please feel free to contact me at 626-574-3528 if you have any questions or concerns that I may not have addressed.

We look forward to being able to serve you better in the future.

Sincerely,

Cari Toneck, VP, CCRO
Chief Compliance Risk Officer
Methodist Hospital of Southern California

Steps You Can Take To Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitor free credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities (from whom you may be able to obtain a police report).

We also recommend that you regularly review the explanation of benefits statement that you receive from your insurer. If you see any service that you believe you did not receive, please contact your insurer at the number on the statement. You may also want to check for any medical bills that you do not recognize.

Keep a copy of this notice for your records in case of future problems with your medical records. You may also want to request a copy of your medical records from your provider, to serve as a baseline.

If you are a California resident, we suggest that you visit the website of the California Office of Privacy Protection at www.privacy.ca.gov to find more information about your medical privacy.

Copy of Credit Report

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by contacting one of the following entities:

Fraud Alert

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above.

Security Freeze

In some US states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. If you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency, there may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift, or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you, including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

Additional Resources on Identity Theft

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, Federal Trade Commission, or from your respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft, including information about how to establish fraud alerts or a security freeze on your credit file. You may also report suspected identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission or to the Attorney General in your state.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We represent Saydel Community School District (Saydel CSD) regarding a data security incident involving Timberline Billing Services, LLC (Timberline), a company located in Iowa. Saydel CSD is located at 5740 NE 14th Street, Des Moines, Iowa. Timberline provides Medicaid reimbursement billing services for Medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in Iowa, including Saydel CSD.

Saydel CSD takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with Timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. Nature of the incident.

In September 2020, Timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that Timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by Timberline. Saydel CSD was first notified of this incident by Timberline on September 2, 2020.

On March 5, 2020, Timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. Timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. Working with outside computer forensics specialists, Timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed Timberlines network between February 12, 2020 and March 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from Timberlines network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, Timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. This review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

Based on the investigation, Timberline discovered that the following Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was compromised: Individuals name in combination with their Medicaid Identification Number, Driver License Number and State Identification Number. To date, Timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

Saydel CSD finished reviewing the list of affected individuals on October 3, 2020 and determined five hundred seventy seven (577) residents were potentially affected. Incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on November 4, 2020 via First Class Mail.

3. Steps taken.

Upon learning of this incident, Timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant Timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. Timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. Timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

Timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. Saydel CSD takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. Saydel CSD is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by Timberline.

4. Contact information.

Saydel CSD remains dedicated to protecting its students sensitive personal information. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@WilsonElser.com or 312-821-6164.

Dear [Customer Name],

At U.S. Bank, we value your confidence in us and place the privacy and security of your information as a top priority. We are writing to let you know about an event that occurred at a U.S. Bank location, which included some of your personal information.

What happened:

On July 30, 2020, a computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. Since the event, we have been focused on identifying who may have been impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

What information was involved:

The information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name, account number, and Social Security number. At this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you or your account.

What are we doing:

We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. As a precautionary measure, if you would like to receive a new account number, you can do so by calling our Fraud Liaison Center at 877.595.6256 between 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. CT, Monday through Sunday. We can help you close and reopen your account with a new account number at no charge.

We also want to inform you of some steps we have taken to protect you and some additional steps you can take to help protect yourself.

Free credit monitoring and identity restoration services

To help you protect your identity, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for two years provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.

To enroll in this service, go to the myTrueIdentity website at mytrueidentity.com and in the space referenced as Enter Activation Code, enter the following 12-letter Activation Code and follow the three steps to receive your credit monitoring service online within minutes.

Unique activation code: <<TU Code>>

Once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain an initial 3-in-1 credit report and credit scores along with two years of unlimited access to your TransUnion credit report and VantageScore credit score by TransUnion. The daily three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at TransUnion, Experian and Equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address and more. The service also includes dark web internet identity monitoring, the ability to lock and unlock your TransUnion credit report, access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (Certain policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

If you believe you may be a victim of identity theft, please call the TransUnion Fraud Response Services toll-free hotline at 855.288.5422. When prompted, enter the following 6-digit telephone pass code 698500 to speak to a TransUnion representative about your identity theft issue.

You can sign up for the myTrueIdentity online credit monitoring anytime between now and December 15, 2020. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. Please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with TransUnion, Experian and Equifax or an address in the United States (or its territories) and a valid Social Security number, or are under the age of 18. Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

What you can do: Free fraud alert information

Whether or not you enroll in credit monitoring, we recommend that you place a Fraud Alert on your credit file. Fraud Alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. A Fraud Alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately. The contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is:

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. Also visit the FTCs website at ftc.gov/idtheft to review their free identity theft resources such as their comprehensive step-by-step guide Identity Theft - A Recovery Plan.

Free credit-security freeze information

You can request a free Security Freeze (aka Credit Freeze) on your credit file by contacting each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies via the channels outlined below. When a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. A credit freeze can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [customer name],

We are writing to inform you that we have discovered evidence of unauthorized access to some of your personal information. We take the security of your personal information seriously and want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to address the situation.

On October 9, 2020, we were alerted to unusual activity on our website, thenorthface.com, which prompted us to investigate immediately. Following a careful investigation, we concluded that a credential stuffing attack had been launched against our website on October 8 and 9, 2020. A credential stuffing attack is a specific type of cybersecurity attack in which the attacker uses account authentication credentials stolen from another source to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

Based on our investigation, we believe that the attacker previously gained access to your email address and password from another source (not from The North Face) and subsequently used those same credentials to access your account on thenorthface.com. We do not believe that the attacker obtained information from us that would require us to notify you of a data security breach under applicable law, but we are notifying you of the incident voluntarily, out of an abundance of caution.

The information that may have been accessed includes your email address, password, products you have purchased on our website, products you have saved to your favorites, your billing address, your shipping address(es), your VIPeak customer loyalty point total, your email preferences, your first and last name, your birthday (if you saved it to your account), and your telephone number (if you saved it to your account). If you saved your payment card (credit, debit or stored value card) to your account on thenorthface.com, the attacker was not able to view your payment card number, expiration date, nor your CVV (the short code on the back of your card), because we do not keep a copy of that information on thenorthface.com.

We have taken steps to address the incident, including implementing measures that limit account logins from sources that we believe are suspicious or in patterns that are suspicious. As a further precaution, we disabled all passwords from accounts that were accessed during the timeframe of the attack. We also erased all payment card tokens from all accounts on thenorthface.com. As such, you will need to create a new (unique) password and enter your payment card information again the next time you shop on thenorthface.com.

We encourage you to take steps to reduce the potential risk of misuse of your online accounts. Please change your password at thenorthface.com and at all other sites where you use the same password. We strongly encourage you not to use the same password for your account at thenorthface.com that you use on other websites, because if one of those other websites is breached, your email address and password could be used to access your account at thenorthface.com. In addition, we recommend avoiding using easy-to-guess passwords.

Please monitor your financial accounts for any suspicious activity. For more information about steps you can take to reduce the likelihood of identity theft or fraud, call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338), visit the FTC's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/, or write to: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. However, if you believe you are the victim of identity theft, you should immediately contact your local law enforcement agency, your state's attorney general, or the FTC.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and want to assure you that the safety of your information on our website is our utmost concern. If you have any questions or concerns, please call us at 1-833-346-5227.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We represent Clinton Community School District (Clinton CSD) regarding a data security incident involving Timberline Billing Services, LLC (Timberline), a company located in Iowa. Clinton CSD is located at 1401 12th Ave N, Clinton, IA 52732. Timberline provides Medicaid reimbursement billing services for Medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in Iowa, including Clinton CSD.

Clinton CSD takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with Timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. Nature of the incident.

In September 2020, Timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that Timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by Timberline. Clinton CSD was first notified of this incident by Timberline on September 2, 2020.

On March 5, 2020, Timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. Timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. Working with outside computer forensics specialists, Timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed Timberline's network between February 12, 2020, and March 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from Timberline's network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, Timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. This review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

Based on the investigation, Timberline discovered that the following Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was compromised: Individuals name in combination with their Medicaid Identification Number. To date, Timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

Clinton CSD determined one thousand six hundred thirty-two (1,632) residents were potentially affected. Incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on October 20, 2020, via First Class Mail. A sample copy of the Incident notification letter mailed to potentially affected residents of Iowa is included with this letter at Exhibit A.

3. Steps taken.

Upon learning of this incident, Timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant Timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. Timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. Timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

Timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. Clinton CSD takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students' information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. Clinton CSD is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by Timberline.

4. Contact information.

Clinton CSD remains dedicated to protecting its students' sensitive personal information. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@WilsonElser.com or 312-821-6164.

Very truly yours,

Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP

San Dieguito has asked Aeries to notify you out of an abundance of caution because your information was present in the affected database.

What Information Was Involved?

While the investigations were unable to confirm whether your information was actually viewed by the unauthorized individual(s), the investigations confirmed that the following information related to you was present in the affected database: <<Breached Elements>>.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear [First Name Last Name ]:

Blue Shield of California (Blue Shield) takes the privacy and confidentiality of your information very seriously. We are writing to inform you of a data incident that involved some of your personal data.

What Happened

On October 20, 2020, Blue Shield discovered that an error occurred when it updated its Medicare Advantage HMO provider directories. This error caused your Social Security Number to display as your provider identification number in the provider directories. Directories were displayed in PDF format on Blue Shields website, and that of its printing vendor, Arvato, between October 16-20, 2020. The directories were viewed, and in some cases, downloaded by brokers, members, and prospects. A number of printed directories were also mailed to Blue Shield brokers and members during this time.

Upon discovering this error, Blue Shield immediately took action to remove these directories from both websites and was able to retrieve and destroy the majority of the downloaded and mailed copies. Blue Shield is not aware of any misuse of your information. However, out of an abundance of caution, Blue Shield is notifying you of this incident.

What Information Was Involved

The information displayed in the directories included your Social Security Number.

What Are We Doing

Blue Shield is committed to safeguarding your personal information and took immediate steps to mitigate and remediate the issue. Blue Shield immediately removed the incorrect directories from its and Arvatos websites and stopped the delivery of the majority of printed copies of the directories before they were delivered to brokers, members, and prospects. Blue Shield was also able to ensure the return or destruction of the majority of the directories that were downloaded or delivered. Blue Shield has also taken steps to improve its processes to ensure that events like this do not occur in the future. Blue Shield has made policy and process changes to limit its disclosure of this type of information to vendors and to ensure that there are additional quality assurance checks before directories are published and mailed.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

Camrosa Water District values the protection of our employees' and customers' information. We are writing to inform you about an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

On August 13, 2020, Camrosa Water District discovered a criminal cyber-attack that resulted in data on certain devices becoming encrypted. We immediately began to investigate, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist. Measures were taken to address the incident and restore operations. The investigation that was recently concluded found evidence that there was unauthorized access to files on Camrosa Water District's file servers between August 20, 2019, and August 13, 2020.

What Information was Involved?

On September 28, 2020, we determined that the file servers accessed included the names and Social Security numbers of Camrosa's current (and in some cases former) employees and current and former customers who currently or formerly paid invoices from Camrosa authorizing Camrosa to debit the customers' checking or savings accounts (via ACH). The information in the accessed file servers may have included your Social Security number and your checking or savings account number. Although the investigation did not determine that the cyber attacker viewed or exfiltrated your personal information, we are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution.

What You Can Do.

While we are not aware of any misuse of your personal information, we encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

RE: Important Security Breach Notification - Please read this entire letter.

Dear [INDIVIDUAL NAME]:

We are contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred on August 25, 2020 at Cantella & Co., Inc. This incident involved email threads which were used to entice recipients to open an attachment containing malware. Malware is a term used to describe any kind of computer software with malicious intent. Recipients of these malicious emails opened the attachments, believing them to be from a credible source, which in turn installed the malware. Unfortunately, this malware is very difficult to detect, and almost none of the virus scanners available out there today are able to do so. In total, we identified 23 infected computers across our organization. Regrettably, some of your personal information may have been contained within these infected computers as many of the emails were internal and therefore deemed to be secure. If you are an entity client, this may include your authorized persons personal information. It is important to note that we have no evidence to support any attempts to misuse private client information thus far, but there is a possibility that your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information may have been potentially exposed to others.

We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. As such, we are providing you with complimentary credit monitoring for the next two years and we ask that you enroll by following the steps outline below. If you are the victim of identity theft, you can file a police report and obtain a copy of it. You may also place a security freeze on your credit reports, free of charge.

A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumers credit report without written authorization. However, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing or other services. Under federal law, you cannot be charged to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. You must place your request for a freeze with each of the three major consumer reporting agencies: Equifax (www.equifax.com); Experian (www.experian.com); and TransUnion (www.transunion.com).

To place a security freeze on your credit report, you may send a written request by regular, certified or overnight mail at the addresses below. You may also place a security freeze through each of the consumer reporting agencies websites or over the phone, using the contact information below:

In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide some or all of the following information to the credit reporting agency, depending on whether you do so online, by phone, or by mail:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security Number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill, telephone bill, rental agreement, or deed;
6. A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state drivers license or ID card, military identification, U.S. Passport etc.);
7. Social Security Card, pay stub, or W2;
8. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

The credit reporting agencies have one (1) to three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security freeze on your credit report, based upon the method of your request. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (PIN) or password (or both) that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. It is important to maintain this PIN/password in a secure place, as you will need it to lift or remove the security freeze.

To lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you must make a request to each of the credit reporting agencies by mail, through their website, or by phone (using the contact information above). You must provide proper identification (including name, address, and social security number) and the PIN number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze, as well as the identities of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report. You may also temporarily lift a security freeze for a specified period of time rather than for a specific entity or individual, using the same contact information above. The credit bureaus have between one (1) hour (for requests made online) and three (3) business	The breach was caused by malware contained in email attachments designed to entice recipients to open it, resulting in the installation of the malware on the network, affecting 23 computers in the organization.

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. At BarristerBooks, we take the privacy and security of your information very seriously. This is why we are notifying you of the incident and informing you about steps you can take to help protect your personal information.

What Happened?

We recently discovered a data security incident involving our website. We immediately launched an investigation and engaged a digital forensics firm to assist. The recently completed investigation determined that payment card information may have been exposed for customers who made purchases through barristerbooks.com, lawbooks.com, or lawbooksforless.com between July 7, 2020, and September 11, 2020.

As a small, family-owned company serving law students since 1999, we have always taken the privacy and security of your information extremely seriously. We have never stored full card payment information in our customer accounts or servers and have always strived to maintain a high degree of security. Despite our protective measures, it appears that an unknown party was able to obtain payment card information at the time of order placement during the approximate eight-week period mentioned above.

What Information Was Involved?

The information involved in this incident may have included your name and the account number, expiration date, and card value verification number for your payment card ending in <<Field 1>>.

What Are We Doing?

As soon as we detected a potential incident, we took the steps described above and worked to determine whether any personal information was accessed or acquired without authorization. As part of this incident, we have notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding the incident and will provide law enforcement whatever assistance is needed. We have adopted even more stringent security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, including moving our card payment processing outside of our website so that order payments are processed directly on PayPal. Once we were able to determine the dates, we immediately began the process of notifying any customer who may have been affected, and we are now providing you with information about steps you can take to help protect your personal information.

What You Can Do:

You should remain vigilant by closely reviewing your account statements for discrepancies. We recommend that you report any such discrepancies to your financial institution, which may be able to offer you a new payment card. You can also review the information on the following page for additional steps you can take to protect your personal information, which include placing a fraud alert on your credit report and a security freeze on your credit file.

For More Information:

Further information about how to protect your personal information appears on the following page. If you have questions concerning this incident, please call (833) 791-1656 Monday-Friday (excluding holidays) from 9 am - 9 pm Eastern Time.

For over 20 years, BarristerBooks has valued each customer we have been fortunate enough to serve, and your trust is of the utmost importance to us. We fully understand the inconvenience and frustration this situation involves. As such, we sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding during what we realize is already a stressful time, and we deeply regret any worry or inconvenience that this incident may cause you.

Sincerely,

BarristerBooks, Inc.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Copy of Credit Report:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that creditors contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We represent Bondurant Farrar Community School District (Bondurant Farrar CSD) regarding a data security incident involving Timberline Billing Services, LLC (Timberline), a company located in Iowa. Bondurant Farrar CSD is located at 300 Garfield Street SW, Bondurant, IA 50035. Timberline provides Medicaid reimbursement billing services for Medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in Iowa, including Bondurant Farrar CSD. Bondurant Farrar CSD takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with Timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. Nature of the incident.

In September 2020, Timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that Timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by Timberline. Bondurant Farrar CSD was first notified of this incident by Timberline on September 2, 2020. On March 5, 2020, Timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. Timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. Working with outside computer forensics specialists, Timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed Timberline's network between February 12, 2020 and March 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from Timberline's network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, Timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. This review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

Based on the investigation, Timberline discovered that the following Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was compromised: Individuals name in combination with their Medicaid Identification Number and/or Drivers License number. To date, Timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

On October 1, 2020, Bondurant Farrar CSD finished identifying a population of five hundred ninety-seven (597) residents that were potentially affected. Incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on November 9, 2020 via First Class Mail. A sample copy of the Incident notification letter mailed to potentially affected residents of Iowa is included with this letter at Exhibit A.

3. Steps taken.

Upon learning of this incident, Timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant Timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. Timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. Timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location. Timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. Bondurant Farrar CSD takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students' information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. Bondurant Farrar CSD is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by Timberline.

4. Contact information.

Bondurant Farrar CSD remains dedicated to protecting its students' sensitive personal information. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@WilsonElser.com or 312-821-6164.

Dear <<Name 1>>,

We regret to inform you that 1919 Investment Counsel recently experienced a security incident that may have impacted some of our current and former employees' personal information. We take the responsibility of protecting our employees' personal information extremely seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any concern this incident may cause.

What Happened?

On September 21, 2020, a 1919ic employee discovered some unusual activity on their 1919ic work computer. We immediately began investigating and retained a third-party forensic expert to assist. During our investigation, we learned that an unauthorized user gained access to 1919ic's computer systems, which are operated by a third-party Managed IT services firm with oversight by 1919ic's internal technology team. During the forensic analysis, 1919ic was able to quickly take steps to prevent further unauthorized access and secure our systems. At this time, we do not have any indication that your information was accessed or misused. However, because we deeply value you and are committed to transparency, we wanted to make you aware of this incident.

What Information Was Involved?

The information we hold about our current and former employees may include one or more of the following: name, address, Social Security number, photo ID, birthdate, bank account information, payroll information, and contact information. While we have no evidence that any of this information was viewed by the unauthorized user, we are notifying you because we cannot conclusively rule out that possibility.

What We Are Doing

We take the security of your information very seriously, and we want to assure you that we've already taken steps to prevent a recurrence by doing additional monitoring of our networks, further improving access controls, and hardening our systems. As a safeguard, we have also arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online, three-bureau credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for two years. This service is provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. We have also secured, regardless of enrollment, identity restoration services, including $1M in identity theft insurance, for two years.

When prompted, enter the six-digit telephone passcode <<Insert static 6-digit Telephone Pass Code>> and follow the steps to enroll in the offline credit monitoring service, add an initial fraud alert to your credit file, or to speak to a TransUnion representative if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

The privacy and security of your personal information is extremely important to the University of California. We are writing to inform you of a security matter involving some of your personal information and to advise you of steps you can take to protect your privacy.

What Happened

On June 1, 2020, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) detected a cybersecurity attack that occurred in a limited part of the UCSF School of Medicines IT environment. Upon detection of the intrusion, we immediately isolated the impacted environment and successfully contained the incident from the core UCSF network. While we stopped the attack as it was occurring, the attacker obtained certain files and encrypted others with ransomware. UCSF made the difficult decision to pay the attacker, and received the information we needed to decrypt the affected servers and data the attackers stole. Although we have no evidence that the personal information taken has been misused, we are notifying you because we determined that some of your personal information was impacted.

What Information Was Involved

The personal information impacted could have included:

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Attorney General Miller:

We represent Indianola Community School District (Indianola CSD) regarding a data security incident involving Timberline Billing Services, LLC (Timberline), a company located in Iowa. Indianola CSD is located at 1301 East Second Avenue, Indianola, IA 50125. Timberline provides Medicaid reimbursement billing services for Medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in Iowa, including Indianola CSD.

Indianola CSD takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with Timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. Nature of the incident.

In September 2020, Timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that Timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by Timberline. Indianola CSD was first notified of this incident by Timberline on September 2, 2020.

On March 5, 2020, Timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. Timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. Working with outside computer forensics specialists, Timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed Timberlines network between February 12, 2020 and March 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from Timberlines network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, Timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. This review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

Based on the investigation, Timberline discovered that the following Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was compromised: Individuals name in combination with their Medicaid Identification Number, Drivers License number, and / or Social Security Number. To date, Timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. Number of Iowa residents affected.

On October 4, 2020, Indianola CSD finished identifying a population of one thousand, one hundred twenty-six (1126) Iowa residents that were potentially affected. Incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on November 9, 2020 via First Class Mail.

3. Steps taken.

Upon learning of this incident, Timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant Timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. Timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. Timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

Timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. Indianola CSD takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. Indianola CSD is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by Timberline.

4. Contact information.

Indianola CSD remains dedicated to protecting its students sensitive personal information. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at Anjali.Das@WilsonElser.com or 312-821-6164.

What Happened

Between April and May 2020, certain email accounts of International Cosmetics & Perfumes employees were affected by a business email compromise attack.

While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we want to provide you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect your personal information, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On October 2, 2020, Backroads became aware of suspicious activity within its computer network. Backroads immediately began an investigation, working with external forensic specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the activity. Our investigation determined that certain files within our environment were encrypted and inaccessible. On October 16, 2020, we discovered that certain files had been accessible to unknown actors and that certain personal information was contained in these files. We recognize that it may feel like there was a delay between the initial incident and receiving this notification. From the moment we knew that files were accessible to the unknown actors, we have been working both internally to determine who could have been affected, as well as externally with appropriate authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate globally. Thank you for your understanding and patience while we worked through all the necessary details.

What Information Was Involved?

Backroads has both legal authority and obligation to maintain personal information for its employees. The forensic investigation confirmed that the following information was stored within one of the impacted network devices and may have been accessible to unknown actors: your name, date of birth, Social Security number, government issued ID (passport or drivers license, if provided to Backroads), financial account information and health insurance information, if obtained through Backroads. While we cannot confirm which piece of your personal information might have been accessed, we are informing employees of the full scope of what could have been compromised due to its presence in impacted files.

What We Are Doing.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information within our custody is among Backroads highest priorities. In order to minimize the chance that latent malware could remain on Backroads systems, we are rebuilding our network from the ground up, and adding further security measures, to better protect against similar incidents in the future.

What You Can Do.

Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information, which contains information on what you can do to better protect against possible misuse of your information.

As an added precaution, Backroads is offering you access to one year of credit monitoring and identity protection services through TransUnion's myTrueIdentity (provided by Epiq) at no cost to you. Details of this offer and instructions on how to enroll in the services are enclosed within this letter.

For More Information.

We understand you may have questions that are not answered in this letter. If you have questions, please call our dedicated hotline at 1-855-914-4688, Monday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST, excluding national holidays.

Monitor Your Accounts

In addition to enrolling in the complimentary services detailed above, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements and explanation of benefits, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors.

You may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:	The breach appears to have been caused by an outside party gaining access to certain files within Backroads' network, and accessing personal information belonging to employees, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, government issued ID, financial account information, and health insurance information.
Insufficient information	There is no information available regarding the type of breach that occurred at AspenPointe Corporation.

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

We wanted to provide you with an update about the recent data security incident experienced by Indian Health Council, Inc. (Indian Health) that may have impacted your protected health information (PHI), including your name, health information, and health insurance information. We take the privacy and security of your information seriously, and sincerely apologize for any concern or inconvenience this may cause you. This letter contains information about steps you can take to protect your information, and resources we are making available to help you.

What happened: On September 22, 2020, we experienced a data security incident that impacted a number of servers and endpoints and disrupted access to certain files on our system. We immediately began an internal investigation and hired independent computer forensic investigators to help us determine what occurred, and whether any information was at risk. The forensic investigator found that an unauthorized actor may have gained access to certain files stored on our system that may have contained some of your PHI.

What information was involved: From our investigation, it appears that documents stored on our system contained your name, date of birth, health information, and health insurance information. For a limited number of individuals, medical information, condition, treatment, or diagnosis information may have also been disclosed.

What we are doing: We want to assure you that we are taking steps to minimize the risk of this kind of event from happening in the future. Since the incident, we have put additional controls in place for any type of remote access to our systems, changed all impacted passwords, and implemented multi-factor authentication.

For more information: Please call 1-833-905-3232 for any additional questions you may have.

Your trust is a top priority for us, and we deeply regret any inconvenience or concern that this matter may cause you.

Sincerely,

Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information

1. Telephone. Contact IDX at 1-833-905-3232 to gain additional information about this event.

2. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

3. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069
Atlanta, GA 30348-5069
www.equifax.com

Experian Fraud Reporting
1-888-397-3742
P.O. Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013

TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

4. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

5. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.

What Happened

On September 29, 2020, we discovered some unauthorized activity performed by a Bank employee.

A thorough investigation was conducted by a forensic investigation firm to determine what happened, who was impacted, and what information may have been affected.

Subject: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>:

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. The privacy and security of the personal information of the individuals we serve is extremely important to Golden Gate Regional Center (GGRC). That is why we are writing to inform you about this incident, offer complimentary identity monitoring and protection services, and provide you with information relating to steps that can be taken to help protect the information of individuals we serve.

What Happened?

On September 23, 2020, GGRC detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity's network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity's files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity's files. Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. Based on preliminary findings of the computer forensics firm, it was determined on October 5, 2020, that certain information belonging to the individuals we serve was acquired by an unknown actor.

While we have no evidence that any personal or protected health information belonging to the individuals we serve has been misused, out of an abundance of caution, we are informing you of the incident and providing you with access to complimentary identity monitoring and protection services from IDX.

What Information Was Involved?

The types of information impacted may include your <<variable text insert data elements>>.

What Are We Doing?

As soon as GGRC discovered the incident, we took the steps described above. We have also taken measures to further enhance the security of information in our possession and to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. In addition, we have notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about this incident, and we will work with and provide assistance to law enforcement to hold the perpetrators accountable.

We are also providing you with information about steps that you can take to help protect your personal information and, as an added precaution, we are offering complimentary identity monitoring and protection services for one year through IDX.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant and review your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC).

Copy of Credit Report:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

[DATE]

Dear [NAME 1]:

We are writing to notify you that we and many other institutions were recently notified by Blackbaud that it experienced a security incident. This notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

What Happened

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified us that it had discovered a ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement. Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the Blackbaud services we use and the information provided by Blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. On September 2, 2020, we determined that the backup files contained certain information pertaining to you.

What Information Was Involved

The backup file involved contained your name and Social Security number. Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

1 Kroll's activation	The breach was caused by a ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network. The backup files containing information of its clients, including names and Social Security numbers, were taken from its network. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. The backup file involved contained certain information pertaining to the individuals and the breach was a result of a hack by an outside party.

What information was involved:
The information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name, account number, Social Security number, and driver's license number. At this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you or your account.

What are we doing:
We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. As a precautionary measure, if you would like to receive a new account number, you can do so by calling our Fraud Liaison Center at 877.595.6256 between 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. CT, Monday through Sunday.

Unique activation code: <<TU Code>>

Once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain an initial 3-in-1 credit report and credit scores along with two years of unlimited access to your TransUnion credit report and VantageScore credit score by TransUnion. The daily three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at TransUnion, Experian and Equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address and more.

You can sign up for the myTrueIdentity online credit monitoring anytime between now and December 15, 2020. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly.

Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

What you can do: Free fraud alert information
Whether or not you enroll in credit monitoring, we recommend that you place a Fraud Alert on your credit file. Fraud Alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. A Fraud Alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately. The contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is:

Free credit report information
Under federal law, you are also entitled to one free credit report once every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 877.322.8228 or make a request online at annualcreditreport.com.

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. Also visit the FTCs website at ftc.gov/idtheft to review their free identity theft resources such as their comprehensive step-by-step guide Identity Theft - A Recovery Plan.

Free credit-security freeze information
You can request a free Security Freeze (aka Credit Freeze) on your credit file by contacting each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies via the channels outlined below. When a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. A credit freeze can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [First Name] [Middle Name] [Last Name] [Suffix],

Merchant One, Inc. (Merchant One) is writing to inform you of an incident that may affect the privacy of some of your personal information. We take the protection of your information very seriously, and although we have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your information potentially affected by this incident, this letter provides details of the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your personal information from possible misuse, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On or about February 24, 2020, Merchant One became aware of suspicious activity related to a third-party IT provider. Upon discovery, we immediately launched an investigation, which included working with third-party forensic specialists to determine the full nature and scope of this incident. The investigation determined that an unknown individual may have accessed specific files in Merchant One's system. Therefore, we began a comprehensive review of the files identified as potentially impacted to determine what information was contained therein and to whom it relates. Upon confirmation that personal information was present in the potentially accessed files, we began reviewing our files to determine address information for those individuals. We worked with a vendor to assist with determining address information for impacted individuals and on October 26, 2020, we received updated information to provide notice to those impacted individuals. Although we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information, we are providing you this notification out of an abundance of caution because your information was present in the potentially impacted files.

What Information Was Involved?

The information present in the potentially impacted files may have included the following data elements: [Impacted Data].

What Are We Doing?

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities, and we have strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon discovering this incident, we immediately took steps to confirm the security of our systems. We implemented additional measures to further protect information, including enhanced email security, multi-factor authentication and additional training. Additionally, we transitioned to utilizing a different IT provider. In an abundance of caution, we are notifying potentially impacted individuals, including you, so that you may take steps to best protect your information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so. Although we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of information as a result of this incident, we arranged to have Kroll monitor your identity for one year at no cost to you as an added precaution.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

University of Minnesota Physicians (UMPhysicians) is writing to make you aware of a data security event that potentially affected the confidentiality of some of your personal information. We have no evidence to suggest that your information was actually viewed during this event and we are not aware of any attempted or actual misuse of your information. However, we are providing you with information about the event, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is necessary to do so.

What Happened?

UMPhysicians identified that cyber attackers used phishing emails to fraudulently access two employee email accounts. The two phishing email attacks were identified on January 31, 2020 and February 4, 2020, shortly after they occurred. UMPhysicians took immediate steps to secure the email accounts and began working with third-party computer forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incidents. The investigation indicated that an unknown actor had access to one employee email account on January 30 and January 31, 2020, and another employee email account on February 4, 2020, for a brief period of time.

Unfortunately, the investigation was unable to determine with certainty to what extent any emails within the two email accounts may have been viewed by the cyber attackers. Based on this, in an abundance of caution, we worked with third-party specialists to perform a comprehensive review of all information stored in the email accounts at the time of the incidents to identify any personal information present in the email accounts. The employee email accounts contained information about individuals because the email accounts were used to perform normal business operations related to health care services provided by UMPhysicians. Upon completion of the third-party specialists review of the full contents of the email accounts, which was a detailed and lengthy process that involved multiple steps to identify the relevant data, we immediately began assessing the results to confirm the identities of potentially affected individuals and obtain their current mailing addresses or other contact information. We recently completed this comprehensive review process.

What Information Was Involved?

Our review determined that an email message containing the following types of information relating to you was present in an affected email account during this incident: <<b2b_text_1 (Data Impacted)>>. We have no evidence indicating that your information was actually viewed during the incident or has been copied or otherwise misused. However, the perpetrators did have access to the two email accounts for a limited period of time so it is possible they may have seen some of your information.

What We Are Doing.

UMPhysicians takes this incident and the security of the information in its care very seriously. We quickly identified the attacks and took steps to secure the affected email accounts. At the time of the attacks, UMPhysicians had multiple email security controls in place, including multi-factor authentication. We also require all employees to participate in privacy and security training, and we regularly conduct exercises to try to make sure personnel do not fall prey to phishing and related scams. As part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy and security of personal information in our care, we reviewed our policies and procedures and implemented additional safeguards to further control and secure the information in our email system. For example, we conducted refresher training for personnel related to best practices in identifying phishing attempts, and we implemented restrictions on email retention. We also purchased additional technology that will provide for more enhanced detection and prevention of phishing emails. In addition, we notified state and federal regulators where we are required to do so. Further, while we are unaware of any misuse of your information as a result of this incident, we are offering you access to complimentary identity monitoring services for 12 months through Kroll.

Atlas Mechanical, Inc. (Atlas) is writing to inform you of a recent event that may impact the privacy of some of your personal information. While we are unaware of any attempted or actual misuse of your information, we are providing you with information about the event, our response, and steps you may take to protect against any misuse of your information, should you feel it is necessary to do so.

What Happened?

Atlas recently became aware of suspicious activity on its computer network and discovered it could not access certain files on its systems. Atlas immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of third-party computer forensic specialists, and determined that its network had been infected with malware which prevented access to certain files on the system. The investigation determined that the malware was introduced into the system by an unauthorized actor who also accessed and acquired certain files in Atlas system. Atlas then began a lengthy and labor-intensive process to identify sensitive information that may have been contained within impacted files, and to identify the individuals whose information may have been impacted. While our investigation is ongoing, we are notifying you because that investigation determined certain information related to you may have been impacted.

What Information Was Involved?

The information in the accessible files includes your name, address, wage/withholding information, and Social Security Number. We have no evidence your information was subject to actual or attempted misuse.

What We Are Doing.

Atlas takes this incident and the security of your personal information seriously. Upon discovery, we immediately launched an investigation and took steps to secure our systems.

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Ziegler, Inc. (Ziegler), to notify your office of a security incident. After discovering unusual network activity, Ziegler immediately took steps to secure its systems and began working to implement enhanced security measures. Ziegler promptly launched an investigation, notified law enforcement and engaged leading third-party specialists to assist with its investigation of this incident.

The investigation determined that an unauthorized party gained access to the network commencing on September 15, 2020 and ending September 27, 2020. During that time, the unauthorized party acquired copies of certain files containing information related to a limited number of individuals. Ziegler conducted a comprehensive review of all files involved, and determined on October 29, 2020, that the name and Social Security number of 580 Iowa residents was involved.

On November 30, 2020, Ziegler began mailing notification letters to the affected Iowa residents whose personal information may have been involved in the incident. A copy of the notification letter is attached. Ziegler is offering a one-year membership in complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Experian to affected individuals. Ziegler has also established a dedicated call center that individuals can call with questions about the incident or enrolling in credit monitoring.

To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, Ziegler has implemented additional measures to enhance its existing security protocols, including implementing enhanced endpoint monitoring.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

Jennifer E. Costa

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>:

Fairchild Medical Center (FMC) is notifying you of an event that may affect the security of some of your personal information. While, to date, we have no evidence that your information has been misused, we are providing you with information about the event, our response to it, and resources available to you to help protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

In late July 2020, FMC was made aware of an issue involving a misconfiguration on one of its servers through a communication from a third-party security company unaffiliated with FMC. FMC immediately commenced an investigation and began working with third-party computer specialists to determine the nature and scope of the issue. FMC also immediately addressed the misconfiguration and took steps to secure the server. A third-party security company verified that the server security change resolved the issue. Through the investigation, FMC determined that a misconfiguration existed from approximately December 16, 2015, to July 31, 2020, that allowed external individual(s) access to the server. On November 5, 2020, following an extensive review of forensic evidence associated with the server, FMC's investigation determined that it could not conclusively rule out unauthorized access to records present on the server during the window of time when the misconfiguration was in place. As such, out of an abundance of caution, FMC reviewed the server to determine what records were present during that window. While the investigation did not confirm that your record was specifically accessed without authorization, in an abundance of caution, FMC is providing you with notice of this incident because your record was present on the server.

What Information Was Involved?

The information contained on the server includes a medical image, your name, date of birth, patient identification number, exam identification number, the ordering provider, and the date of the exam. Please note, this incident did not affect your full medical record. Additionally, this incident did not affect your Social Security number, nor your financial information.

What Is FMC Doing?

Information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. FMC has strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. Upon learning of this incident, we moved quickly to respond. This included conducting an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists and engaging in steps to ensure the security of the one affected server. The security change of the server was verified by a third-party security firm to confirm resolution of the server security issue.

What Can You Do?

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements and explanation of benefits, and to monitor your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. Please review the information contained in the attached Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information.

For More Information.

If you have additional questions, please contact our dedicated assistance line at (833) 752-0849 from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm Pacific Time, Monday through Friday, except holidays.

What Happened:
On or about October 20, 2020, Minerals Technologies Inc. (MTI) experienced a security breach that compromised certain servers maintained by MTI. In response, MTI immediately retained an IT firm to conduct a thorough forensic investigation into the incident. On October 22, 2020, based on its preliminary investigation, MTI learned that the incident may have resulted in unauthorized access to the PII of certain MTI employees and their dependents. While there is no indication that any personal information has been misused, we are providing this notification out of an abundance of caution so that you can diligently monitor your accounts and those of your dependents.

What Information Was Involved:
The PII that may have been accessed by the unauthorized individual may include your or your dependents' (if applicable) name, home address, mailing address, personal phone number, social security number, date of birth, personal email address, banking information (account type, routing number, account number), dependent information, benefit plan information (including insurance policy numbers and beneficiaries), salary history, and pay history.

What MTI is Doing:
The confidentiality of PII is one of MTI's top priorities. Immediately upon learning of the incident, we took steps to ensure that the unauthorized individual no longer had access to our system and took steps to investigate and contain the incident. We retained a third-party IT firm to conduct a thorough forensic investigation and to assist in the remediation of our system, including implementing additional security measures. As such, we have already strengthened our system and will continue to do so throughout this response process and beyond.

Credit Monitoring Services:
While MTI is not aware of any identity fraud or improper use of any PII as a direct result of this incident, out of an abundance of caution, we have arranged to have TransUnion provide you and your adult dependents with two (2) years of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. In addition, we have arranged to provide your minor dependents (i.e., those dependents under 18 years of age) with access to Equifax's Equifax Child Identity Monitoring service.

We are writing to notify you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud). This notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified us that it had discovered a ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. The time period of unauthorized access was between February 7, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the Blackbaud services we use and the information provided by Blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. On September 15, 2020, we determined that the backup files contained certain information pertaining to you.

What Information Was Involved?

The backup file involved contained your name and Social Security number. Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

Dear <<Name 1>>,

We are writing to inform you of an incident we discovered regarding our website that may affect the security of some of your personal information. Between September 5 and September 14, we experienced a malicious attack, during which our customers' information may have been captured. You are receiving this notice because you made a purchase on the website during this timeframe, and your payment card information may be at risk.

What We Are Doing.

We are extremely sorry for any inconvenience or harm that this incident may have caused you and are committed to earning back your trust. The security of your credit card information and privacy of interactions are of utmost importance to us at Lazarus Naturals. We have taken exhaustive steps to ensure that your information and privacy will be protected in the future and do not take this situation lightly. Since the incident was discovered, we have taken the following steps to secure your information:

- Immediately removed the malicious code and conducted a thorough internal investigation of what happened, how it happened, and how to prevent it in the future
- Engaged a third-party forensic investigation team to review our internal processes, systems, and other relevant information, who confirmed we took the proper steps to protect our customers.
- Enacted new security protocols and restructured our server architecture to remove the possibility of a similar situation in the future.
- Notified potentially impacted customers of the incident via this letter with ways you can protect your personal information.

At the same time, we were conducting our investigation, we implemented a planned migration from our previous website platform on which this incident occurred to a new, more secure platform. We do not expect to experience a similar issue on our new website.

What Happened?

On September 14, 2020, we identified suspicious activity on our website and immediately began an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists to assess the nature and scope of the incident. Through the investigation, it was determined that malicious code was inserted by an unauthorized party on the checkout page of our website from September 5, 2020, to September 14, 2020, which may have had the ability to capture customer information while making a purchase.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined the type of information potentially impacted by this incident includes your name, address, and payment card information (account number, card expiration date, and security code). We do not store any payment information after purchase, so only information entered between September 5, 2020, and September 14, 2020, may have been impacted.

What Can You Do?

We have arranged to have TransUnion provide credit monitoring and identity protection services to you for one (1) year at no cost to you as an added precaution. Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information for instructions on how to enroll in these services.

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent Insurance Audit Services, Inc., 214 West 35th Street, Davenport, IA 52806 (IAS). Pursuant to Iowa Code Ann. 715C.2, we write to notify you of an incident that affects the security of information relating to 5,997 Iowa residents. At this point, we are not aware of any losses or harm arising from the incident. By providing this notice, IAS does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law or personal jurisdiction.

IAS is a leading provider of premium audit services and solutions to the P&C insurance industry. On behalf of its commercial carrier clients, IAS audits the commercial insurance policies of thousands of businesses nationwide. In the course of those audits, IAS collects information from its carrier clients and their policyholders.

On October 28, 2020, attackers deployed a ransomware attack in IAS's network. Immediately after discovering the attack on the morning of October 28, IAS retained legal counsel and engaged a computer forensics firm to investigate and determine the scope of the attack. IAS also notified law enforcement and is cooperating with an investigation. On November 6, 2020, IAS's forensics team identified evidence consistent with exfiltration of data. On November 10, 2020, IAS completed its analysis of the data that we believe may have been compromised to identify those impacted by the incident. In consultation with IAS's legal and forensics teams, IAS paid the ransom that the attackers demanded and received the keys needed to decrypt its network, details regarding any information the attackers copied from its network, and confirmation that they had deleted any such data.

It appears that data belonging to IAS employees and audited policyholders in Iowa was exfiltrated from IAS's network. With respect to IAS employees, the impacted data included copies of employees' IRS Forms 1095-C, which contain names, addresses, and Social Security numbers. With respect to audited policyholders, the impacted data may have included the policyholders' business names, business addresses, phone numbers, insurance policy numbers, federal employer identification numbers (FEIN), and IAS-generated usernames and one-time-use initial passwords to an IAS file transfer portal. In some cases, the impacted FEINs may have been Social Security numbers.

Pursuant to Iowa Code Ann. 715C.2, IAS is providing notice to 48 employees and 5,949 policyholders in Iowa. IAS notified its employees of the incident by e-mail on November 12, 2020, and is in the process of sending a follow-up letter to those employees. IAS is also in the process of disclosing this security incident by letter to all impacted policyholders in this state. Notices will be mailed on November 30, 2020. This notice has not been delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

After a thorough analysis and investigation into the attack, IAS believes that the risk of harm to consumers is low. IAS paid the ransom the attackers demanded and received confirmation that any data exfiltrated from IAS's network had been deleted. Moreover, the policyholders whose FEINs were impacted by this incident are nearly all commercial entities. As such, much of the impacted FEINs were true FEINs, rather than Social Security numbers. As to those consumers, the risk is even further reduced, and the impacted data does not qualify as personal information. Iowa Code Ann. 715C.1(11)(a) (defining personal information with no mention of business information in definition). IAS is choosing to disclose to those policyholders because of its inability to determine with certainty that the impacted FEINs are not Social Security numbers. Nonetheless, and out of an abundance of	The breach was caused by a ransomware attack in IAS's network, which was discovered on October 28, 2020. IAS retained legal counsel and engaged a computer forensics firm to investigate and determine the scope of the attack, and found evidence consistent with exfiltration of data on November 6, 2020. IAS's forensics team identified that data belonging to IAS employees and audited policyholders in Iowa was exfiltrated from IAS's network.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened?
Between 2019-04-26 and 2020-11-22, the email address and date of birth (when present) of the user who wrote the latest annotation for any given MusicBrainz entity were available on a JSON block in the source of the entity page. We investigated our database to determine which users were affected. Your email address and date of birth, if you entered it, were temporarily available on our web page. The data was never displayed on the page in a human visible way -- it was embedded in the web page source as JSON. The page source can be viewed with view source on your web browser. We know some of the email addresses were found by spammers, but some affected editors seem to not have received any spam emails. As such, we cannot be sure whether any specific editor's data was actually seen by anyone, but the possibility existed.

What Information Was Involved?
Email addresses and birth dates (when present). No other private information was leaked.

What We Are Doing.
We fixed the breaching code as soon as we found it, audited all of our code to make sure this was the only place where a leak was happening, and are currently hard at work adding additional checks that will warn us (and notify us of an error) if any private user data can be found on the source for a MusicBrainz page again.

What You Can Do
You shouldn't need to do anything - the data is no longer being leaked and no passwords were leaked so you do not need to change your password.

Other Important Information.
A more detailed explanation can be found at our blog post that originally disclosed the issue. If 500 citizens of the state of California had their data leaked, we would be required by law to notify the state of the breach. We cannot know for certain if 500 citizens of California were involved in this breach, since we do not know where our users live. Furthermore, email addresses and dates of birth do not seem to be covered by the requirement to file a notice, unless accompanied by passwords, which did not leak in this case. However, we are still notifying the state of California about this breach, as a precautionary measure, even though we do not believe that we are required to do so.

For More Information
If you have a specific question not covered here nor on the blog post, don't hesitate to write to us at support@metabrainz.org.

RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

We are contacting you to inform you of a data incident experienced by a third-party vendor for Cathedral Catholic High School (CCHS, school) that involved your personal information. To provide peace of mind, the vendor is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services.

Blackbaud Inc. is an international provider of fundraising and financial software for charitable and nonprofit organizations, which hosts a variety of databases for CCHS. On Sept. 29, 2020, Blackbaud notified us that a security incident the company detected in May included several school files containing sensitive personal information. CCHS requested information detailing which of our constituents information may have been compromised. We received that information and after additional analyses are sharing it with you today.

This incident involved information stored in files more than 15 years ago in certain Blackbaud Solution back-ups. The sensitive personal information potentially exposed included your name, address, phone number, and Social Security number. According to Blackbaud, the information was exposed because certain legacy files on its servers were not destroyed or encrypted after the company migrated school files to a new platform. Until Sept. 29, 2020, Blackbaud had assured us that all sensitive personal information was encrypted. Blackbaud's recent disclosure follows its initial announcement in July 2020 of the data incident.

What You Can Do:

To help you guard against potential identity theft or other fraud as a result of this incident, Blackbaud is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services for 24 months provided that you register within 90 days of the date of this letter. Information about how to access these services accompanies this letter. Although services are available to you, it is important to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspected fraud to law enforcement. For information on avoiding identity theft, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

In addition, security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of the incident and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file. (Credit bureau contact information is attached.)

For More Information:

We recognize you may have questions not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please call IDX at (800) 939-4170. IDX representatives are fully versed on the incident and can answer questions or concerns you may have regarding protection of your personal information.

Enclosed hereto you will find additional information regarding the resources available to you, and the steps that you can take to further protect your personal information.

Cathedral Catholic High School is continuing to investigate to learn more about this incident and what additional precautions Blackbaud is taking to prevent future attacks. Please be assured of our commitment to protecting our constituents' personal information, and of our gratitude for your support of the work of the Church.

Sincerely,

Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear [NAME],

We are writing to inform you about a recent event that may have impacted the security of some of your personal information. We received your information in connection with insurance consulting and brokerage services on behalf of your current or former employer, [Company Name]. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information, we are providing you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is necessary to do so.

What Happened?

We recently discovered suspicious activity related to certain employee email accounts. We immediately took steps to secure the email accounts and launched an investigation which included working with a third-party forensic investigator to determine the nature and scope of the activity. The investigation determined that email accounts belonging to our employees were subject to unauthorized access on separate occasions between March 2, 2020, and April 30, 2020. As a result, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain emails and attachments within the accounts.

What Information Was Involved?

The investigation was unable to identify all emails or attachments in the accounts that the unauthorized individual may have accessed or acquired. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we notified [Company Name] of this incident and conducted a review of the entire contents of the email accounts for emails or attachments that contain personal information. This review was completed on September 1, 2020, and we are notifying you of this incident because the investigation confirmed that the accounts may have contained your [VARIABLE TEXT FIELD]. To date, we have not received any reports of actual or attempted misuse of your information.

What We Are Doing.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care are one of our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. When we discovered this incident, we immediately reset the email account passwords and took steps to determine what personal information was in the accounts and to which Woodruff Sawyer clients the information belonged. We also confirmed the security of our employee email accounts and related systems. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of personal information in our care, we are working to review our existing policies and procedures, to implement additional safeguards, and to provide additional training to our employees on data privacy and security. We will also be notifying state and federal regulators, as required. As an added precaution, we are offering you complimentary access to one year of credit and identity monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration services through Kroll. We encourage you to enroll in these services, as we are not able to act on your behalf to enroll you. Please review the instructions contained in the attached Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information for additional information on these services.

What You Can Do.

You may review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information, which contains general information on what you can do to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is appropriate to do so. You may also enroll to receive the free credit and identity monitoring services we are offering.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Subject: Notice of Unauthorized Access to Glofox Data

Dear Glofox Admin,

We regret to inform you that an unknown third party gained unauthorized access to certain data related to Glofox users. We are currently conducting a thorough investigation and want to inform you as soon as possible.

What Happened?

On November 14th, we discovered that an unknown third party had accessed some user data, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, hashed/scrambled passwords, and other optional information such as date of birth. No plain text passwords were exposed. The user data was from an archive of information dated March 27th, 2020. No data collected after that date was accessed. We can confirm that no credit card or payment method data was accessed. We do not store any of this information in our systems as part of our standard security measures. We can confirm that x of your clients were impacted. y% of these had a password in Glofox. z% of these had a date of birth in Glofox. We have identified and closed the path that led to the unauthorized access.

What Should Glofox Administrators Do Now?

We have reset your Glofox account password and the passwords related to your staff to prevent unauthorized access to your account. You and your staff will need to follow the Glofox forgot password flow the next time you log in. Even though no plain text passwords have been exposed, as a precaution, if you or your staff use your Glofox password on other websites, we recommend that you change these passwords. We ask that you pass this recommendation onto your staff.

Do You Need to Inform Your Members?

We do not believe that the overall risk associated with your members' data is high. However, you may decide to notify your members. If you decide to do so, here is a suggested message you can send them:

Hi <first name>,

We have been informed of a security incident on the Glofox platform that may impact some of your personal details. The personal details may include your name, email address, phone number, hashed/scrambled (I.e. not plain text) password, and other optional information like date of birth. No financial information or credit card details have been exposed. While no plain text passwords have been exposed, as an abundance of caution we recommend that you reset your password for Glofox and, if you have been using your old password across multiple websites, we recommend to change those passwords also. Glofox has informed us that this is an isolated incident and they have identified and closed the path that led to the breach.

What We Are Doing?

Data security is a top priority for us here at Glofox. We have significantly invested in our security infrastructure over the past 12 months. While we are deeply disappointed that this incident has occurred, we will continue to invest in our infrastructure to prevent incidents like this in the future. As we are the controllers in respect of the personal data of your account administrators, and although we do not believe that the overall risk associated with this data is high, we have taken the decision that we will notify our relevant data protection supervisory authorities. In respect of the personal data of your members, you will separately need to assess whether you have any obligation to notify your local data protection supervisory authority of this incident. We have initiated communications to all of our impacted customers and will be in touch if we have any more information or actions.

If you have any questions, please contact our team at dataprivacy@glofox.com.

Dear John Doe,

At U.S. Bank, we prioritize the privacy and security of your information. We are writing to inform you of an event that occurred at a U.S. Bank location, which included some personal information that you, a related person, or related business client shared with us during an application process or as a result of a prior U.S. Bank acquisition. The information may be several years old, dating back 10 years or more.

What happened:
On July 30, 2020, a computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. Since the event, we have been focused on identifying who may have been impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

What information was involved:
The information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name and Social Security number. At this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you.

What are we doing:
We want to let you know of some steps we have taken to protect you and some additional steps you can take to help protect yourself.

Free credit monitoring and identity restoration services
To help you protect your identity, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for two years provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To enroll in this service, go to the myTrueIdentity website at mytrueidentity.com and in the space referenced as Enter Activation Code, enter the following 12-letter Activation Code and follow the three steps to receive your credit monitoring service online within minutes.

Unique activation code: 123456789012

Once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain an initial 3-in-1 credit report and credit scores along with two years of unlimited access to your TransUnion credit report and VantageScore credit score by TransUnion. The daily three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at TransUnion, Experian and Equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address and more. The service also includes dark web internet identity monitoring, the ability to lock and unlock your TransUnion credit report, access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (Certain policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

If you believe you may be a victim of identity theft, please call the TransUnion Fraud Response Services toll-free hotline at 855.288.5422. When prompted, enter the following 6-digit telephone pass code 698500 to speak to a TransUnion representative about your identity theft issue.

You can sign up for the myTrueIdentity online credit monitoring anytime between now and March 30, 2021. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. Please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with TransUnion, Experian and Equifax or an address in the United States (or its territories) and a valid Social Security number, or are under the age of 18. Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

What you can do: Free fraud alert information
Whether or not you enroll in credit monitoring, we recommend that you place a Fraud Alert on your credit file. Fraud Alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. A Fraud Alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately.

The contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is:

Free credit report information
Under federal law, you are also entitled to one free credit report once every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 877.322.8228 or make a request online at annualcreditreport.com.

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. Also visit the FTCs website at ftc.gov/idtheft to review their free identity theft resources such as their comprehensive step-by-step guide Identity Theft - A Recovery Plan.

Free credit-security freeze information
You can request a free Security Freeze (aka Credit Freeze) on your credit file by contacting each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies via the channels outlined below. When a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. A credit freeze can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

What Happened

On May 7, 2020, Robie & Matthai, APC (the Firm) was the victim of a ransomware attack. We were able to recover our information from offline backups with no significant interruption in service. After a third-party forensic analysis, however, we determined that the individual(s) who carried out this attack (the Attacker) may have accessed some of the personal information on our system. You are receiving this notice because we believe your personal information may have been included among that data set.

What Information Was Involved

After careful review, we have determined that your <<Affected Data String>> may have been accessed by the attacker.

What We Are Doing

We had reasonable security measures in place prior to the attack, but have implemented all additional safeguards recommended by our third-party forensic consultants in order to prevent similar attacks in the future. In addition, we are offering identity theft protection services through ID X at no cost to you. IDX services include: <<12/24>> months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. With this protection, IDX will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised.

What You Can Do

We have no evidence to suggest that your information has been misused at this time, but we encourage you to take full advantage of the identity theft protection services described above. You can contact IDX and enroll by calling 1-800-939-4170 or going to https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect and using the Enrollment Code provided above. IDX experts are available Monday through Friday from 6 am - 6 pm Pacific Time. Please note the deadline to enroll is February 16, 2021. We have also included additional information in the Recommended Steps below with contact information for the three major credit bureaus and select government agencies.

For More Information

You will find more detailed instructions for enrollment on the enclosed Recommended Steps document. Please do not discard this letter: you will need to reference the enrollment code at the top of this letter when calling or enrolling online. IDX representatives have been fully versed on the incident and can answer questions or concerns you may have regarding protection of your personal information.

Sincerely,

Kyle Kveton
Robie & Matthai, APC

To Enroll, Please Call: 1-800-939-4170
Or Visit: https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect
Enrollment Code: <<XXXXXXXX>>

Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your IDX identity protection membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, IDX will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact IDX at 1-800-939-4170 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in IDX, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the IDX website and filing a request for help.

If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you may need to prove that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone or via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069
Atlanta, GA 30348-5069
www.equifax.com

Experian Fraud Reporting
1-888-397-3742
P.O. Box 9554
Allen, TX 75013
www.experian.com

TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

Please Note: No one can place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

Sonoma Valley Hospital (SVH) places a high priority on safeguarding your personal and health information. We regret to inform you that SVH recently suffered a ransomware attack, which resulted in potential disclosure of certain patient health information to an unauthorized third party. We are contacting you personally to explain the circumstances of the incident.

What happened?

SVH experienced a ransomware cyberattack on October 11, 2020, by what is believed to be a Russian threat actor. This event was part of a broader attack on dozens of hospitals across the country. We discovered the attack on that same day and immediately responded by shutting down all systems to contain the damage. We promptly notified law enforcement of the incident and engaged a leading external cybersecurity firm to assess the potential disclosure of protected health information. In a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. After discovering the attack, our cybersecurity team, in partnership with outside information technology and forensics experts, successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and ultimately expelled them from our system. As recommended, SVH did not pay ransom.

What information was involved?

A thorough forensic investigation determined that information that may have been compromised includes health claims data sent to insurers electronically, including patient name, address, birthdate, insurer group number and subscriber number, as well as diagnosis or procedure codes, date of service, place of service, amount of claim, and secondary payer information. If, and only if, you received imaging services or your service resulted in a grievance, appeal, or quality review, certain additional medical record data such as imaging tests or other may have been disclosed. Based on the reports of the forensics analysts, patient financial information (such as credit card or social security number) was neither accessed nor disclosed. SVH is not aware of any misuse or attempted misuse of patient health information, and our forensics experts have searched for any potential redisclosures.

What we are doing.

We deeply regret the incident and the concern it has caused to our employees. In response, we activated a series of enhanced security measures to improve information security and prevent further ransomware or cybersecurity attacks.

What you can do.

Please review the enclosed Additional Resources section included with this letter. This section describes additional steps you can take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission regarding identity theft protection. If you have questions, please call 1-877-374-2465 Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Central Time (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time).

WHAT HAPPENED?

On Thursday, November 12th, Spotify discovered a vulnerability in our system that inadvertently exposed your Spotify account registration information, which may have included email address, your preferred display name, password, gender, and date of birth only to certain business partners of Spotify.

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. EyeMed, who manages vision benefits on behalf of your <<b2b_text_2 (carrier or Name of Covered Entity)>>, takes the privacy and confidentiality of your information very seriously.

On July 1, 2020, EyeMed discovered that an unauthorized individual gained access to an EyeMed email mailbox and sent phishing emails to email addresses contained in the mailbox's address book. On the same day, EyeMed took immediate action to block the unauthorized individual's access to the mailbox and secured the mailbox. EyeMed immediately launched an investigation into the incident and engaged a cybersecurity firm to assist in its efforts. It was determined that the unauthorized individual first gained access to the mailbox on June 24, 2020, and that access terminated on July 1, 2020.

The mailbox contained information about individuals who formerly or currently receive vision benefits through EyeMed. Although EyeMed could not fully determine whether, and to what extent, if any, the unauthorized individual viewed or copied personal information, it is possible that personal information was viewed or acquired by the unauthorized individual.

Following a detailed analysis and review of all potentially compromised emails and files, EyeMed identified the names of all individuals who were impacted, as well as the type of information included in those files. Personal information that may have been accessed could include the following types of information: <<b2b_text_3 (Impacted Data)>><<b2b_text_4 (Impacted Data)>>.

EyeMed is committed to safeguarding your personal information and has taken immediate steps to enhance the protections that were already in place before this incident. In addition to the investigation, EyeMed made changes to how authorized individuals access the EyeMed network and required immediate complex password changes to all our employee accounts. EyeMed is also reinforcing and providing additional mandatory security awareness training.

To help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for two years. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data. Your identity monitoring services include Credit Monitoring, Fraud Consultation, and Identity Theft Restoration.

If you identify services that you did not receive or accounts, charges, or withdrawals that you did not authorize, you should immediately contact and report to the involved company and to credit reporting agencies.

Notice of Data Incident

Dear <<FirstName>> <<LastName>> ,

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information and to provide you with steps you can take to protect your identity. We take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously.

This incident was publicly announced by Belden, Inc. (Belden) on November 24, 2020. We are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident.

What happened?

On November 18, 2020, Grass Valley USA, LLC and its worldwide affiliates (Grass Valley) were made aware of a data security incident affecting its former owners, the Belden group. Grass Valley was owned by Belden until July 2020. Belden continues to provide IT, HR and other services for Grass Valley pursuant to the terms of Grass Valley's divestiture.

On the evening of November 12, 2020, Belden IT professionals detected unusual activity involving certain company servers. Belden has reported to Grass Valley that upon detection of this activity, Belden immediately triggered its cybersecurity incident response plan, deployed teams of internal IT specialists, and engaged leading third-party cybersecurity forensic experts and other advisors to identify the scope of the incident and move quickly to mitigate the impact. According to Belden, forensics experts determined that Belden was the target of a sophisticated attack by a party outside the company. We understand that Belden learned on or about November 15, 2020, that the outside party accessed servers that contained, among other things, personal information of various individuals. Belden informed Grass Valley upon becoming aware that Grass Valley's current and some former employees were affected by the incident.

What information was involved?

Belden has informed Grass Valley that the personal information involved in this incident may have included your name, birthdate, government-issued identification numbers (for example, social security number), bank account information (for North American employees on Belden/Grass Valley payroll), home addresses, email addresses, and other general employment-related information.

What we are doing?

The Grass Valley Senior Leadership Team has been working closely with Belden on your behalf. While Belden's investigation continues, Belden has informed us that it believes that it has stopped further unauthorized access of personal data on its servers. Belden is also working with regulatory and law enforcement officials, including the F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security, to investigate the matter, and we have engaged legal counsel to help us notify appropriate regulatory authorities. In addition, Belden has informed us that it is continuously monitoring for any suspicious activity on its systems that may impact Grass Valley employees and has deployed additional resources to reinforce the security of its systems.

To help relieve concerns and attempt to mitigate the consequences of this incident on affected individuals, Belden is offering a complimentary twenty-four month membership of Experian IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft.

NOTICE OF A DATA BREACH

We are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident involving a company called 1ShoppingCart.com (1ShoppingCart). Gundry MD contracts with 1ShoppingCart to process payments made through our website. On October 30, 2020, we learned from 1ShoppingCart that an unauthorized third party accessed 1ShoppingCart's systems and collected information regarding transactions placed on Gundry MD's website from August 6, 2020, to August 22, 2020.

Based on 1ShoppingCart's forensic investigation, the person who gained access to its systems could have accessed your name, address, phone number, email address, and payment card information, such as credit/debit card number, CVV code, and expiration date. The incident did not involve your Social Security number.

Upon learning of the incident, Gundry MD promptly requested that 1ShoppingCart provide us with additional information about the incident, as well as a list of individuals who may have been impacted. We have been working with 1ShoppingCart to obtain additional information about the nature of the event to determine the impact on your personal information. On October 30, 2020, we confirmed that some of your personal information may have been affected by the incident. We are not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft arising out of the incident. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to provide you with notice about the incident.

As a precautionary measure, we also recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained.

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft. For more information and to contact the FTC, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You may also contact the FTC at Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Credit Reports: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/manualRequestForm.action.

Alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies. Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries is as follows:

Equifax 1-866-349-5191 www.equifax.com P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374

Experian 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com P.O. Box 2002 Allen, TX 75013

TransUnion 1-800-888-4213 www.transunion.com P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016

Fraud Alerts: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. A fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit report for one (1) year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you before establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting agencies as specified above to find out more information.

Individuals interacting with credit reporting agencies have rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. We encourage you to review your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act by visiting https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/bcfp_consumer-rights-summary_2018-09.pdf, or by requesting information in writing from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.

For further assistance, please call 1-833-971-3278 8:00 am to 5:30 pm Central Time, Monday-Friday excluding major US holidays.

We value the trust you place in us and take our responsibility to safeguard your personal information seriously. We apologize for any inconvenience or concern this incident might cause.

Sincerely,

The Gundry MD Team	The breach involved an unauthorized third party gaining access to the 1ShoppingCart.com system, and collecting information regarding transactions made through Gundry MD's website, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and payment card information, such as credit/debit card number CVV codes, and expiration dates.

We are writing to inform you of a cybersecurity incident that may have affected personal information related to you. You provided the information to Merchant Services* in the course of enrolling for a merchant account.

On November 6, 2020, through Merchant Services* internal cybersecurity program, we discovered a potential compromise of a website used by part of our U.S. business. We promptly initiated an investigation to determine the nature and potential impact of the vulnerability. In the course of doing so, we identified suspicious activity indicating that an unauthorized actor submitted automated queries to the website. We created a secure environment to test the queries, using available logs and other information to assess potential impact.

By November 19, 2020, we determined that a subset of the queries identified might have involved data held on the website. We analyzed logs and other information available to assess whether those queries could have returned information to unauthorized actors, and we engaged external forensics experts to assist. By December 3, 2020, we determined that some queries may have compromised certain information held on the website, although the evidence is not conclusive. At this time, we have identified evidence of suspicious activity on the website between May 13, 2018, and November 24, 2020. We have notified law enforcement.

Although we are not aware of any evidence confirming that the activity resulted in unauthorized actors acquiring or misusing your personal information, we are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution so that you can take steps to protect yourself.

The information about you that may have been accessed includes your name, contact details, Social Security number, and bank account information. The website did not hold customer transaction data, consumer data, or payment card information. The website impacted is separate from Merchant Services* core processing and operating systems. The website was part of a legacy system used internally and by a small group of former Chi Payment agents, a group acquired in an acquisition of iPayment in 2018, and contains certain data of a limited subset of merchants and agents.

We take the privacy and security of your personal information seriously. After discovering the incident, we took steps to prevent further unauthorized access and have closed the website. We continue to invest in cybersecurity, including enhancing our website scanning practices and vulnerability detection program.

Additionally, we have arranged for you to obtain credit monitoring and identity monitoring services at no cost to you for two years through Kroll, a leading provider of credit monitoring and identity monitoring services. Information regarding the package of services is included in Attachment 2 to this letter.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Security Event

To <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>>:

We are writing to inform you of a data security event that occurred at MEDNAX Services, Inc. (MEDNAX) and may have impacted your personal information. MEDNAX provides revenue cycle management and other administrative services to its affiliated physician practice groups, including <<b2b_text_1 (covered entity name,/one)>> from which you may have received services.

What happened?

On June 19, 2020, MEDNAX discovered that an unauthorized third party gained access to certain Microsoft Office 365-hosted MEDNAX business email accounts through phishing. Phishing occurs when an email is sent that looks like it is from a trustworthy source, but it is not. The phishing email prompts the recipient to share or give access to certain information. Upon discovery of this event, MEDNAX immediately took action to prevent any further unauthorized activity, began an investigation, and engaged a national forensic firm.

Based on the investigation, the unauthorized party was able to access certain business email accounts between June 17, 2020 and June 22, 2020. The event was limited to a small number of business email accounts. Those email accounts are separate from MEDNAX's internal network and systems, which were not involved in the event. Even though a thorough investigation was conducted, it was not possible to conclusively determine whether personal information was actually accessed by the unauthorized party. Based on the data analysis that was performed and ultimately completed in late November 2020, we were able to determine which individuals may have had personal information in the impacted business email accounts. <<b2b_text_2 (The data of forty-five (45) Rhode Island residents may have been impacted.)>> Based upon our thorough review of this matter, we are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this event. However, we are notifying you because your personal information may have been in one or more of the impacted business email accounts.

What information may have been involved?

The patient information may have included: (1) patient contact information (such as patient name, guarantor name, address, email address, and date of birth); (2) Social Security number, driver's license number, state identification number, and/or financial account information; (3) health insurance information (payor name, payor contract dates, policy information including type and deductible amount and subscriber/Medicare/Medicaid number); (4) medical and/or treatment information (dates of service, location, services requested or procedures performed, diagnosis, prescription information, physician names, and Medical Record Numbers); and (5) billing and claims information (invoices, submitted claims and appeals, and patient account identifiers used by your provider). Please note that not all data fields may have been involved for all individuals.

What we are doing.

MEDNAX takes the security of personal information seriously. As soon as we discovered the phishing event, we immediately took action to prevent any further unauthorized activity, including resetting user passwords for business <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>> <<address_1>> <<address_2>> <<city>>, <<state_province>> <<postal_code>> <<country>> email accounts where unauthorized activity was detected. We have and continue to enhance our security controls as appropriate to minimize the risk of any similar event in the future. In addition, we have arranged to offer you identity monitoring services for a period of one year, at no cost to you. You have until March 16, 2021, to activate these services, and instructions on how to activate these services are included in the enclosed Reference Guide.

What you can do.

In addition to enrolling in complimentary identity monitoring, the enclosed Reference Guide includes additional information on general steps you can take to monitor and safeguard your personal information. We encourage you to carefully review credit reports and statements sent from providers as well as your insurance company to ensure that all account activity is valid; any questionable charges should be promptly reported to the provider's billing office, or for insurance statements, to your insurance company.

For more information

If you have any questions about this matter or would like additional information, please refer to the enclosed Reference Guide, visit www.emailevent.kroll.com, or call toll-free 1-833-971-3267. This call center is open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central Time, Monday through Friday, excluding major U.S. holidays.

Mary Ann E. Moore
Chief Compliance Officer

Reference Guide

Review Your Account Statements

Carefully review statements sent to you from providers as well as from your insurance company to ensure that all account activity is valid. Report any questionable charges promptly to the provider's billing office, or for insurance statements, to your insurance company.

Provide Any Updated Personal Information to Your Health Care Provider

Your health care provider's office may ask to see a photo ID to verify your identity. Please bring a photo ID with you to every appointment if possible. Your provider's office may also ask you to confirm your date of birth, address, telephone, and other pertinent information so that they can make sure that all of your information is up-to-date. Please be sure and tell your provider's office when there are any changes to your information. Carefully reviewing this information with your provider's office at each visit can help to avoid problems and to address them quickly should there be any discrepancies	The breach was caused by an unauthorized third party that gained access to certain Microsoft Office 365-hosted MEDNAX business email accounts through phishing. The unauthorized party was able to access certain business email accounts between June 17, 2020, and June 22, 2020.

Re: Notice of Data Event

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent AFTRA Retirement Fund (AFTRA) located at 261 Madison Avenue, 7th floor, New York, NY 10016-2309. We are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to five hundred thirty-four (534) Iowa residents. This notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. By providing this notice, AFTRA does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

AFTRA originally notified the media nationwide and placed notice of the incident on its website on February 25, 2020.

Nature of the Data Event

On October 28, 2019, AFTRA received an alert of suspicious activity in its environment. AFTRA immediately launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the incident. As part of the investigation, which was conducted with the assistance of a third-party forensic expert, it was determined that certain files and folders on AFTRAs network may have been subject to unauthorized access for periods of time between October 24, 2019 and October 28, 2019. AFTRA does not have evidence that files containing sensitive information were accessed; however, access to these files could not be ruled out. Since providing the initial notice via press release and web posting, AFTRA continued its extensive internal review of the files and folders that may have been subject to unauthorized access.

On September 25, 2020, AFTRA completed its review and produced a list of individuals that may have been impacted. The information that was potentially subject to unauthorized access includes: name, address, date of birth and Social Security number.

Notice to Iowa Residents

AFTRA originally began mailing notice to impacted individuals on February 25, 2020. On that same date, AFTRA provided notification of this event via a press release to major media outlets in Iowa and through a posting on the homepage of its website.	The notification letter suggests that there was an unauthorized access to certain files and folders on AFTRA's network. Although AFTRA does not have evidence that files containing sensitive information were accessed, access to these files could not be completely ruled out. The incident appears to be an unintended disclosure not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

Dear [Name]:

At U.S. Bank, we place the privacy and security of your information as a top priority. We are writing to let you know about an event that occurred at a U.S. Bank location, which included some personal information that either you, a related person or related business client shared with us during an application process or as a result of a prior U.S. Bank acquisition. The information may be several years old, dating back 10 years or more.

What happened:

On July 30, 2020, a computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. Since the event, we have been focused on identifying who may have been impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

What information was involved:

The information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name and Social Security number. At this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you.

What are we doing:

We want to let you know of some steps we have taken to protect you and some additional steps you can take to help protect yourself.

Free credit monitoring and identity restoration services

To help you protect your identity, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for two years provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.

What you can do:

Free fraud alert information

Whether or not you enroll in credit monitoring, we recommend that you place a Fraud Alert on your credit file. Fraud Alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. A Fraud Alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately.

Free credit report information

Under federal law, you are also entitled to one free credit report once every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. Call 877.322.8228 or make a request online at annualcreditreport.com.

Even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. Also visit the FTCs website at ftc.gov/idtheft to review their free identity theft resources such as their comprehensive step-by-step guide Identity Theft - A Recovery Plan.

Free credit-security freeze information

You can request a free Security Freeze (aka Credit Freeze) on your credit file by contacting each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies via the channels outlined below. When a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. A credit freeze can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

You Can Take Additional Steps to Help Protect Yourself

Place a one-year fraud alert on your credit file:
An initial one-year fraud alert tells anyone requesting your credit file that you might be at risk for fraud. A lender should verify that you have authorized any request to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit, and/or get a new card on an existing account. If the lender can't verify this, they shouldn't process the request.

Contact any one of the credit reporting agencies to set up an initial one-year fraud alert:
- Equifax
- Experian
- TransUnion

Place a security freeze on your credit file:
A security freeze on your credit file prevents anyone from accessing your credit report and therefore from issuing credit in your name. However, placing a security freeze also may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

Contact all three of the credit reporting agencies above to set up a security freeze with each of them.

Order your free annual credit reports:
Visit annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228 to get a free copy of your credit reports. Once you receive them:
- Verify that all information is correct.
- Look for discrepancies such as accounts you didn't open or creditor inquiries you didn't authorize.
- Contact the credit reporting agency if you notice incorrect information or have questions.

Manage your personal information:
- Carry only essential documents with you.
- Be cautious about sharing your personal information with anyone else.
- Shred receipts, statements, and other documents containing sensitive information.
- Use anti-virus software on your computer and keep it updated.

Use tools to monitor your credit and financial accounts:
We suggest that you carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card, and other account information on chase.com and in statements for any transaction you don't recognize. We can provide copies of past statements at no cost to you. Call us at 1-888-868-8618 to report unauthorized transactions. Work with us to close your account(s) and open new ones with new account numbers. Create alerts with your credit card company and bank to notify you of activity.

File an identity-theft report with your local police and contact the credit reporting agency that issued the report if you find unauthorized or suspicious activity on your credit report.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Security Event

To <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>>:

We are writing to inform you of a data security event that occurred at MEDNAX Services, Inc. (MEDNAX) and may have impacted your personal information. MEDNAX provides revenue cycle management and other administrative services to its affiliated physician practice groups, including <<b2b_text_1 (covered entity name,/one)>> from which you may have received services.

What happened?

On <<b2b_text_2 (Date of Discovery)>>, 2020, MEDNAX discovered that an unauthorized third party gained access to a Microsoft Office 365-hosted MEDNAX business email account through phishing. Phishing occurs when an email is sent that looks like it is from a trustworthy source, but it is not. The phishing email prompts the recipient to share or give access to certain information. Upon discovery of this event, MEDNAX immediately took action to prevent any further unauthorized activity, began an investigation, and engaged a national forensic firm.

Based on the investigation, the unauthorized party was able to access a business email account <<b2b_text_5 (Incident Timeline)>><<b2b_text_6 (Incident Timeline Continued)>>. The email account is separate from internal network and systems, which were not involved in the event. Even though a thorough investigation was conducted, it was not possible to conclusively determine whether personal information was actually accessed by the unauthorized party. Based on the data analysis that was performed and ultimately completed in December 2020, we were able to determine which individuals may have had personal information in the impacted business email account. Based upon our thorough review of this matter, we are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this event. However, we are notifying you because your personal information may have been in the impacted business email account.

What information may have been involved?

The patient information may have included: (1) patient contact information (such as patient name, guarantor name, address, email address, date of birth, and/or electronic signature); (2) Social Security number, drivers license number, non-resident and alien registration number, and/or financial account information; (3) health insurance information (payor name, payor contract dates, policy information including type and deductible amount and subscriber or Medicare number); (4) medical and/or treatment information (dates of service, location, services requested or procedures performed, diagnosis, physician names, and Medical Record Numbers); and (5) billing and claims information (invoices, submitted claims and appeals, and patient account identifiers used by your provider). Please note that not all data fields may have been involved for all individuals.

What we are doing.

As soon as we discovered the phishing event, we immediately took action to prevent any further unauthorized activity, including resetting the user password for the business email account where unauthorized activity was detected. We have and continue to enhance our security controls as appropriate to minimize the risk of any similar event in the future. In addition, we have arranged to offer you identity monitoring services for a period of one year, at no cost to you. You have until March 23, 2021 to activate these services, and instructions on how to activate these services are included in the enclosed Reference Guide.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

What Happened?

On Monday, December 21, 2020, NetGalley experienced a data security incident. What initially seemed like a simple defacement of our homepage has, with further investigation, resulted in the unauthorized and unlawful access to a backup file of the NetGalley database. Our database backup was stored in the Amazon Cloud. One of our testing servers had been left unsecured, and the credentials became easily attainable by a hacker.

What Information was Involved?

It is possible that your NetGalley Profile information was exposed as a result of this incident. This information includes your login name and password, first/last name, email address, and country. Also, if supplied by you, your Bio, mailing address, phone number, birthday, company name, and Kindle email address. There was no financial information stored in the NetGalley database, so none was lost.

What are we Doing?

We re-secured our testing sites and updated our protocols to ensure their security going forward. We have also:

-Revised our database backup procedure to ensure this data is never again exposed

-Changed all legacy passwords that had access to any NetGalley systems or data

-Added new security features into the site to improve the security of your personal information

-We are continuing to investigate this incident and ensure that no further damage is incurred.

What can you Do?

To better protect your account security, NetGalley is requiring all members to reset their passwords. Starting December 23rd, you'll be required to reset your password before signing in to your NetGalley account.

Other Important Information:

We have informed the FBI of this data breach, and the situation is under investigation. We will use this notice to update you with any definitive new information related to the breach. Your privacy and the integrity of our service is very important. We are committed to improving our protection of your personal information.

For more information:

If you have any additional questions, please contact concierge@netgalley.com.	The breach was caused by unauthorized and unlawful access to a backup file of the NetGalley database, which was stored in the Amazon Cloud, due to the testing server being left unsecured and becoming easily attainable by a hacker.

Additional Important Information

Although we feel the incident does not create a danger of identity theft or fraud, we want to make sure you can get more information about these issues. The FTC is a good resource and can be reached at www.ftc.gov/idtheft or by calling 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338). You can also contact the national credit reporting agencies at:

You may wish to review the tips provided by the FTC on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft. You may also contact the FTC at Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Credit Reports: You may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/manualRequestForm.action.

Alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies. Contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries is as follows:

Equifax 1-866-349-5191 www.equifax.com P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374

Experian 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com P.O. Box 2002 Allen, TX 75013

TransUnion 1-800-888-4213 www.transunion.com P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016

Fraud Alerts: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. A fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit report for one (1) year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. Additional information is available at www.annualcreditreport.com.

Credit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information:

Equifax Security Freeze 1-888-298-0045 www.equifax.com P.O. Box 105788 Atlanta, GA 30348

Re: Incident Notification

Dear Sir or Madam,

We are writing on behalf of certain Dickey's Barbecue Pit franchisee entities (collectively, "Dickey's"), to notify you of a security incident potentially involving Iowa residents. Dickey's corporate headquarters is located at 4514 Cole Avenue, Suite 1015, Dallas, TX 75205.

After receiving reports on October 13, 2020, that a payment card security incident may have occurred at certain Dickey's franchise restaurants, Dickey's immediately took action to identify and stop the unauthorized activity and began working with its franchisees to conduct a coordinated and thorough investigation. Forensic investigation firms were engaged. Dickey's also notified law enforcement and worked with the payment card networks to coordinate the investigation. Additionally, Dickey's provided a preliminary notice of the incident by posting a statement on the Dickey's corporate website on November 20, 2020, while the investigation was ongoing.

The investigation is nearly complete. The investigation found the installation of unauthorized code designed to find payment card data at certain franchise restaurant locations at different times over the general period of June 9, 2019, to November 24, 2020, for most locations and a few weeks later for a few locations. The unauthorized code was removed during the investigation. The unauthorized code was only found at approximately fifty-five franchise locations. There are other franchise locations that were investigated, and the unauthorized code was not found. In Iowa, the investigation did not identify unauthorized code at any franchise locations.

In addition to these locations, there are other locations that updated their payment application server or system before the investigation began or that otherwise had a server or system that was no longer available for analysis, including one franchise location in Iowa. If the unauthorized code had been installed at those locations, the change or update ended the operation of the unauthorized code. Because the investigation identified some locations that still had their original payment application server or system and that had no evidence of the installation of unauthorized code, Dickey's does not believe that every location that changed or updated its payment application server or system would have had unauthorized code installed.

The code searched for data in the format of track data read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through a restaurant's server. That data may have included the cardholder's name, primary account number, expiration date, and internal verification value.

Although the investigation was largely able to identify the locations and time frames involved or potentially involved, it was not able to identify the specific individuals potentially involved. Consequently, Dickey's is providing substitute notice today by issuing a press release, posting a statement on the Dickey's corporate website, and emailing its Big Yellow Cup Rewards members who used a payment card at an involved or potentially involved franchise location during the time frame for that location. Copies of the press release, website statement, and email are attached. The website will contain a tool that customers can use to look up the franchise locations and time frames involved. In addition, Dickey's has established a dedicated, toll-free call center that customers can call to obtain more information regarding the incident.

Before this incident occurred, many Dickey's franchise restaurants had already implemented a new payment system that uses EMV payment technology. Dickey's has requested that any franchisee who has not yet done so complete that implementation. Dickey's also deployed an endpoint detection and response tool to devices in its corporate environment during the investigation and is developing plans to keep an EDR tool in place moving forward. Dickey's is exploring additional measures to further enhance payment card security and to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,

Craig A. Hoffman
Partner

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Dickey's Provides Update About Payment Card Incident

DALLAS, TX December 29, 2020 - Dickey's provided additional information today regarding the payment card security incident reported on November 20, 2020.

After receiving reports that a payment card security incident may have occurred at certain Dickey's franchises or locations, Dickey's immediately began working with our franchisees to conduct an investigation and forensic investigation firms were engaged. Dickey's also notified law enforcement and the payment card networks.

A thorough investigation is being conducted and is nearly complete.

The unauthorized code was only found at approximately 55 locations. In addition to these locations, there are other locations that updated their payment application server or system before the investigation began or that otherwise had a server or system that was no longer available for analysis. If the unauthorized code had been installed at those locations, the change or update ended the operation of the unauthorized code.

Blackbaud is a cloud-computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to organizations, including Valley Presbyterian. Upon receiving notice of the cyber incident, we immediately commenced an investigation to better understand the nature and scope of the incident and any impact on Valley Presbyterian data. This notice provides information about the Blackbaud incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

Blackbaud reported that it experienced a ransomware incident that resulted in encryption of certain Blackbaud systems between May 14, 2020, and May 20, 2020.

Following its investigation, Blackbaud notified its customers that an unknown actor may have accessed or acquired certain Blackbaud customer data. Blackbaud reported that the data was exfiltrated by the threat actor at some point before Blackbaud locked the threat actor out of the environment on May 20, 2020. Upon learning of the Blackbaud incident, Valley Presbyterian immediately commenced an investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive Valley Presbyterian data was potentially involved. This investigation included working diligently to gather further information from Blackbaud to understand the scope of the incident, and on December 14, 2020, we determined the total population of affected individuals and their contact information.

Fraud Alert:
You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name.

Security Freeze:

As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<Name 1>>,

The International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers (BAC) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may impact the privacy of some of your personal information. We wanted to provide you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it necessary.

What Happened?

On June 29, 2020, BAC discovered suspicious activity relating to certain BAC employee email accounts. BAC immediately changed the passwords for the email accounts and began an investigation with assistance from outside computer forensics specialists to determine the nature and scope of the incident. The investigation determined that the employees' email accounts were subject to unauthorized access between June 4, 2020, and July 10, 2020. While our investigation was able to confirm access to the accounts, the investigation was unable to rule out access to any emails or attachments within the accounts. As a result, and with the assistance of third-party forensics, we began an extensive review of the email accounts to determine whether they contained any sensitive information and to whom the information relates. The forensic investigator completed its careful, time-consuming analysis of the contents of the email accounts on September 21, 2020, and prepared a list of potentially impacted individuals whose information was determined to be present in the emails or attachments possibly viewed by the unauthorized person(s). BAC is still searching its internal records to locate the addresses for certain potentially affected individuals. BAC also notified state regulators, as required.

What Information Was Involved?

The following types of personal information were found within the impacted email accounts: your name, <<data elements>>. To date, we have no indication that any personal information has been subject to actual or attempted misuse in relation to this incident.

What We Are Doing.

We take this incident and the security of personal information within our care very seriously. Upon discovery of this incident, we immediately took steps to secure the email accounts and launched an in-depth investigation with the assistance of outside computer forensics specialists to determine the full nature and scope of this incident. As part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy of personal information in our care, we reviewed our existing policies and procedures and implemented additional safeguards to further secure the information in our systems. We also notified regulatory authorities, as required by law. As an added precaution, BAC is also offering twelve (12) months of complimentary access to credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration services through TransUnion. Individuals who wish to receive these services must enroll by following the attached enrollment instructions.

What You Can Do.

You can find out more about how to protect against potential identity theft and fraud in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Personal Information. There you will also find more information on the credit monitoring services we are offering and how to enroll.

For More Information.

We understand that you may have questions about this incident that are not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please call the dedicated assistance line that we have helped set-up at 800-369-1370, Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, excluding U.S. holidays.

We take your privacy and online security very seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any concern this incident may cause. This letter contains information about what happened, actions we have taken to prevent a reoccurrence, and steps you can take to protect your information.

On September 7, 2020, we discovered that some ROMWE customers' usernames and passwords found on the dark web may have been stolen from our computer network in July 2018, as determined by internal and external forensic investigations. These usernames and passwords, if used, could have provided access to your ROMWE account information, including name, email, and phone number, or other optional information you may have stored. If you stored your credit card information in your account, it remains secure since we do not keep your full credit card information.

What Are We Doing?

Over the past several years, ROMWE has continued to improve its security protections as part of its regular security program activities, including by increasing password encryption and using more advanced intrusion detection technologies. For the present matter, we have also forced password resets for all potentially affected customers. In an abundance of caution, we are offering to potentially affected customers identity theft protection services through IDX, the data breach and recovery services expert. IDX identity protection services include 12 months of CyberScan (dark web) monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed ID theft recovery services.

Fraud Alerts: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least one (1) year.

Credit and Security Freezes: You may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. Since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting agencies using the contact information above.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We regret to inform you that one of our third-party vendors, Blackbaud, experienced a cyber incident that may have allowed access to some of your personal information. As a result, you are entitled to free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is an engagement and fundraising software service provider that offers multiple solutions to non-profit companies, schools, and institutions across the United States. Blackbaud was the target of a ransomware attack, and the cyber-criminal may have had access to specific personal information identified below between February and May 20, 2020.

Once Blackbaud detected the intrusion, it was able to halt further system access. The cyber-criminal only gained access to certain back-up files in specific Blackbaud solutions. Blackbaud, in conjunction with the FBI, investigated the incident and ultimately paid a ransom to the cyber-criminal under the assurance that any exfiltrated files would be destroyed. Their system was fully restored after ransom payment. Through vigilant monitoring post-incident, Blackbaud reports that there has been no evidence of improper use of any of the data files that may have been exposed. Blackbaud has already implemented changes to their data security protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.

As part of their continuing investigation, Blackbaud discovered when it merged data from previous versions of some of their solutions into current versions, there were hidden tables containing the older data (which included unencrypted Personal Information) merged into the new program which were not visible. We were notified of this new exposure on September 29, 2020, and took action to verify and determine scope. We are notifying you now of the breach, as it took time to coordinate with Blackbaud and their cooperation in producing the hidden data files. According to Blackbaud, the information was exposed because the company failed to destroy or encrypt certain legacy files after a migration of our files to a new platform.

What PI Was Exposed?

At this time, we are informed that sensitive personal information, including your name, phone number, address, and Social Security or Tax Identification number, may have been exposed. This is older data from the prior legacy versions of the programs that were used before migration.

What You Can Do:

To help you guard against identity theft or other potential fraud as a result of this incident, Blackbaud is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services for 24 months. Information about how to access these services accompanies this letter. Although services are available to you, it is important to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspected fraud to law enforcement. For information on avoiding identity theft, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

In addition, security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file.

For residents of Iowa: State law advises you to report any suspected identity theft to law enforcement or to the Attorney	The breach was caused by a cybercriminal who used ransomware to attack Blackbaud, a third-party vendor of the Matson Navigation Company, which may have allowed access to some personal information of customers.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Please read this entire letter. We are contacting you regarding a data security incident at Matson Navigation Company that Matson learned of on October 14, 2020. This incident may have involved your personal information, including personal information that may have included your name, birth date, Social Security Number, and other identifying information. As a result, your personal information may have been exposed to others. Please be assured that we are taking all appropriate steps necessary to address the incident.

What happened?

On Wednesday, October 14, 2020, Matson learned that its network had experienced a cyber-attack in which the attacker accessed parts of our network. Our IT team worked quickly to cut off the attacker's access. We do not know with certainty whether any internal information was exposed or stolen in the course of the breach of our network, but we are proceeding as if it was. We have no indication at this time that any of our information has been used or sold.

What information was involved?

Among the information on the servers that were likely accessed is personal information, which would likely include your name, birth date, contact information, and Social Security Number. The information maintained in the accessed servers was collected in the normal course of business by Matson's Human Resources department and benefits groups, because you have worked with or for Matson.

What are we doing?

As soon as Matson learned that its network experienced a cyber-attack, it hired leading forensics, cyber-recovery first responder, credit reporting, and legal teams to assist in our incident response. We believe we cut off the attacker's access quickly, have been successful in safely restoring our systems, and are ensuring that those systems are clean. We are still working hard at our recovery of some systems and files, and in the meantime, operations have continued normally. We continue to book freight, and our vessels continue to sail as scheduled. We have also reported the incident to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>,

The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) is writing to notify you of a data security incident relating to your purchase through our online store (https://my.ahima.org/store/) that may have involved your payment card information. At AHIMA, we take the privacy and security of your information very seriously. I want to inform you of the incident and to advise you about certain steps you can take to ensure your information is protected.

What happened?

On October 13, 2020, we learned of suspicious activity relating to our online store. Upon discovering the activity, we took immediate steps to secure our system and customer information. We also immediately began an investigation into the incident. In connection with that investigation, AHIMA engaged a nationally recognized digital forensics firm to determine whether any customer information had been accessed or acquired without authorization. On December 3, 2020, the investigation determined that certain payment card information may have been exposed as a result of the incident.

What Information Was Involved?

The incident affected certain payment card information belonging to individuals who made purchases through our online store between July 26, 2020, and July 29, 2020, and October 1, 2020, and October 16, 2020. The payment card information that may have been compromised included names, card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.

What We Are Doing:

As soon as we discovered the incident, we took the steps described above. We have also reported the incident to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and will cooperate with them to hold the perpetrators accountable. In addition, we are offering you complimentary identity theft protection services through IDX. Your IDX identity protection membership includes 12 months of fully managed identity theft recovery services. With this protection, IDX will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised due to this incident.

Steps You Can Take to Further Protect Your Information

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity:

As a precautionary measure, I recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Copy of Credit Report:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

Under federal law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement. You cannot be charged to place, lift or remove a security freeze.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state. Contact information for the FTC is: Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20580, www.consumer.ftc.gov or www.ftc.gov/idtheft, 1-877-438-4338.

You also have certain rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA):

These rights include knowing what is in your file; to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information; to have consumer reporting agencies correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information, as well as others. For more information about the FCRA, and your rights under the FCRA, please visit http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201504_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf?

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

We are writing to inform you that your personal information may have been compromised due to a possible data breach within our system. We regret to inform you of this incident and want to assure you that we are taking steps to address the issue.

What Happened?

Between October 8th to 15th, our office received several IRS e-file rejections due to tax returns already being on file with the IRS for 2019 for clients we were then processing.

What Information was Involved?

The type of information that we believe may have been compromised includes:

- Names
- Addresses
- Social Security Numbers
- Bank account information, if in our system for refunds or electronic funds withdrawal for tax filings
- Dates of birth
- Drivers License Number, if you have provided this to us for e-filing in the past
- Dependent(s) name, Social Security Number(s) and Date(s) of Birth

What are We Doing?

After receiving several IRS e-file rejections, we spent the next several weeks working with multiple IT forensic services to determine if our office was the source of the issue. During the course of these investigations, a malware file was detected and immediately deleted. We have not been informed that the malware specifically operated in any particular manner; however, based on the investigations conducted, it was determined that it is more likely than not that the malware file was the source of the compromise that led to the fraudulent tax returns. We have reason to believe that on September 10, 2020, a malware file gained access to one of our servers and allowed a perpetrator to access 2018 and 2019 income tax data.

As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of your information, we implemented increased security measures, including a top-tier anti-virus software (ESET) on all of our workstations. Please know that since this determination, our office has been in contact with the Internal Revenue Service, where an independent review is being performed to determine whether your tax account has been compromised and to attempt to identify the perpetrator.

Steps to Take to Protect Your Identity

We encourage you to maintain vigilance against other incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity for the next twelve (12) to twenty-four (24) months.

You may also choose to voluntarily enroll in the IRS Identity Protection PIN program, where the IRS will mail you a six-digit number each January that prevents someone else from filing a tax return using your Social Security Number. Please bear in mind that if you choose to enroll and misplace your IP PIN, your tax return would be required to be filed via the traditional paper process. Beginning in mid-January 2021, you can enroll using an online service via https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin.

Norton LifeLock

Under California law, we are required to offer you 12 months of single-bureau credit monitoring service at no cost to you. However, we value you too much to offer only the minimum, so we have contracted with Norton LifeLock to provide you with their premium three-bureau identity monitoring for 24 months to all affected clients who wish to use their service.

Veritex Holdings, Inc. (Veritex) is writing to inform you of an incident that could affect the security of some of your information. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we take this incident very seriously and we are providing you with information about the incident, our response to it, and resources available to you to help protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

Earlier this year, Veritex became aware of unusual activity involving certain employee email accounts and immediately began an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic investigators. On May 8, 2020, the investigation determined that certain employee email accounts were accessed without authorization at varying times between April 2, 2020 and April 27, 2020. Unfortunately, the available evidence did not allow us to determine what, if any, emails and attachments were viewed while the accounts were subject to unauthorized access.

Therefore, the forensic investigator reviewed the email accounts to identify any personal information that was located in the email accounts at the time of the unauthorized access and could have been accessible. On September 25, 2020, we determined that some personal information was present in one or more of the email accounts at the time of the incident. We reviewed this information and our internal records to identify the individuals associated with this information and their address for purposes of providing notice. Through this process we determined that some of your personal information was contained in one or more of the impacted email accounts.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation determined that at the time of the incident the email accounts contained information including your name, <<Data Elements>>. To date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

What We Are Doing.

We take this incident and the security of personal information in our care very seriously. Upon learning of this incident, we promptly began an investigation using external digital forensic specialists, changed email account credentials, and investigated to confirm the security of our email network. We are also working to enhance our existing security processes and protocols.

As an added precaution, we are also offering you access to 12 months of identity monitoring services through TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies at no cost to you. These services include credit monitoring and identity theft restoration. If you wish to activate these identity monitoring services, you may follow the instructions included in the Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information.

What You Can Do.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Information. You can also enroll to receive the free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services we are offering.

For More Information.

We understand that you may have questions about this incident that are not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please call our dedicated assistance line at 855-940-5298 between 9 am and 9 pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding major U.S. holidays.

Dear [NAME],

We are writing to inform you of a security event that may have impacted your personal information. MEDNAX Services, Inc., a service provider and business associate of American Anesthesiology, reported to us that patients' personal information was stored within email accounts that were accessed by an unauthorized party following a phishing event.

We want to assure you that we take patient privacy very seriously, and while we are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this event, we want to make sure you are aware of the facts surrounding this event so that you can take the appropriate precautions you feel are needed to protect your personal information.

What Happened?

On July 16, 2020, we were notified that an unauthorized party had gained access to several email accounts on our business associate's Microsoft Office 365 hosted email system (O365 System) between June 17, 2020, and June 22, 2020, through phishing. Based on the investigation that our business associate performed, and ultimately completed in November 2020, your personal information was stored within one or more of these email accounts. We cannot tell from available forensic evidence if these files were actually viewed by the unauthorized party. The unauthorized actions we are able to see in these email accounts all appear to be in furtherance of unsuccessful payroll fraud attempts. Efforts to change the bank details for employee pay were not successful.

What Information Was Available?

Our business associate has reported that personal information may have included:

1. Patient contact information (such as patient name, guarantor name, address, email address, and date of birth)
2. State identification number and/or social security number
3. Health insurance information (payor name, payor contract dates, policy information including type and deductible amount and subscriber/Medicare/Medicaid number)
4. Medical and/or treatment information (dates of service, location, services requested or procedures performed, diagnosis, prescription information, physician names, and Medical Record Numbers)
5. Billing, payment, and claims information (invoices, payment details, submitted claims and appeals, and patient account identifiers used by your provider)

Please note that not all of these data fields may have been involved for all individuals.

What We Are Doing

After discovering the phishing event, our business associate took steps to terminate the unauthorized party's access to the O365 System. This included, for example, resetting each user's password for the email accounts where unauthorized activity was detected. The email accounts on the O365 system that were used by American Anesthesiology employees have now been moved over to our email system. We have added authentication requirements to restrict access to the email accounts of these American Anesthesiology employees. We also will be introducing additional authentication and security training requirements for all of our employees in 2021 to counteract phishing and other social engineering techniques.

What You Can Do

In addition to enrolling in complimentary credit monitoring, we encourage you to carefully review credit reports, patient billing statements, and statements sent from your insurance company to ensure that all account activity is valid; any questionable charges should be promptly reported.

For More Information

If you have any questions or would like additional information, please refer to the enclosed Reference Guide, visit www.AmericanAnesthesiology.kroll.com, or call toll-free 1-833-971-3306. This call center is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central Time, excluding major U.S. holidays.

Gail Madison-Brown
Vice President for Compliance

American Anesthesiology, Inc. is offering you a one-year, complimentary membership for IdentityWorksSM, a product offered by Experian, to help with detection and resolution	The breach in this case involved a phishing event, where an unauthorized party accessed several email accounts on the business associate's Microsoft Office 365 hosted email system between June 17, 2020, and June 22, 2020. The breach was caused by outsiders who gained unauthorized access to the system through phishing.

Dear <<Name 1>>,

US Fertility (USF) provides IT platforms and services to several infertility clinics, including <<Variable Data 2 Practice>>. USF is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of health information we gather in providing services. We are writing to make you aware of a recent incident that may affect the privacy of some of your protected health information. Please read this letter carefully and be sure to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have.

What Happened?

On September 14, 2020, USF experienced an IT security event (the Incident) that involved the inaccessibility of certain computer systems on our network as a result of a malware infection. We responded to the Incident immediately and retained third-party computer forensic specialists to assist in our investigation. Through our immediate investigation and response, we determined that data on a number of servers and workstations connected to our domain had been encrypted by ransomware. We proactively removed a number of systems from our network upon discovering the Incident. With the assistance of our third-party computer forensic specialists, we remediated the malware identified, ensured the security of our environment, and reconnected systems on September 20, 2020. We also notified federal law enforcement authorities of the Incident and continue to cooperate with their investigation. The forensic investigation is now concluded and confirmed that the unauthorized actor acquired a limited number of files during the period of unauthorized access, which occurred between August 12, 2020 and September 14, 2020, when the ransomware was executed.

What Information Was Involved?

We have been working diligently with a specialized team of third-party data auditors to perform a comprehensive review of all information contained in the files accessed without authorization as a result of the Incident. The purpose of this review was to accurately identify any individuals whose personal information may have been present within the impacted files and therefore accessible to the unauthorized actor. We recently received the results of this review and determined on December 4, 2020, that the following information relating to you was included in the impacted files when they were accessed without authorization: name and <<Breached Elements>>. The impacted files may have also contained your date of birth. Please note, however, that we have no evidence of actual misuse of your information as a result of the Incident.

What We Are Doing.

In response to the Incident, USF has taken the following actions to mitigate any risk of compromise to your information and to better prevent a similar event from recurring: (1) fortified the security of our firewall; (2) utilized the forensic specialists engaged to monitor network activity and remediate any suspicious activity; (3) provided notification to potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible. We are also adapting our existing employee training protocols relating to data protection and security, including training targeted at recognizing phishing emails. We believe these steps will be effective in mitigating any potential harm to you. As always, we encourage you to review your account statements, explanations of benefits, and credit reports carefully for unexpected activity and to report any questionable activity to the associated institutions immediately.

RE: Security Incident Notification

To Whom It May Concern:

I serve as counsel for the Wayne State Foundation (hereinafter "WSF"), and provide this notification to you of a recent data security incident suffered by Blackbaud. Blackbaud is one of the world's largest providers of customer relationship management systems, serving more than 35,000 clients around the world in the nonprofit and education sectors, including WSF.

On July 16, 2020, WSF was notified by Blackbaud that it had discovered and stopped a ransomware attack that occurred in May 2020. According to the notification received by WSF, Blackbaud's systems that were affected by the attack included a database containing certain information about WSF's community. According to the notification provided by Blackbaud, the attacker(s) may have acquired an unknown amount of data maintained within Blackbaud's database. Blackbaud informed us that it paid a ransom to the attacker and obtained confirmation that the compromised information had been destroyed and is no longer in the possession of the attacker(s).

According to Blackbaud, and as far as we know, there is no indication that any of the compromised information has been subject to misuse or to further disclosure. Blackbaud has made numerous assurances that bank account information, usernames, passwords, and Social Security numbers that may have been contained in the affected systems were encrypted and the decryption keys were not compromised.

On September 23, 2020, WSF received a backup of their Blackbaud database impacted by the incident suffered by Blackbaud. WSF immediately began working to review the data to determine whether sensitive information was contained within the database. However, due to the complexity of the database file provided by Blackbaud, this took significant time and effort with the assistance of third-party forensic experts. At this time, WSF had no reason to believe that any resident of Iowa was impacted.

On November 17, 2020, WSF's experts provided a list of all individuals contained within the Blackbaud database, as well as the potentially impacted information. At this time, no personal information was identified. However, after further review, WSF discovered that the Blackbaud database's Import ID field may have contained individuals' Social Security number despite Blackbaud's continued assurances that such information was not impacted in this incident.

On December 29, 2020, after a thorough review process, WSF confirmed that two thousand, eight hundred and ninety-two (2,892) residents of Iowa were potentially impacted as a result of this incident, as their Import ID is the same as the individual's Social Security number. WSF is working to provide notification, including complimentary credit monitoring services for one (1) year, to affected individuals on January 13, 2021. A copy of the drafted letter is attached. WSF is taking steps to comply with all applicable notification obligations.

Please contact me should you have any questions.

Very truly yours,

CIPRIANI & WERNER, P.C.

The American Federation of Musicians and Employers Pension Fund (AFMEPF) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may impact the privacy of some of your personal information. We wanted to provide you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it necessary.

What Happened?

On August 18, 2020, AFMEPF discovered suspicious activity relating to an AFMEPF employee's email account. AFMEPF immediately changed the user's password and began an investigation with assistance from outside cyber-forensic specialists to determine the nature and scope of the incident. The investigation determined that unauthorized access to the email account occurred between May 22, 2020, and August 18, 2020. However, the forensic investigation was unable to determine access to specific emails and/or attachments. AFMEPF, in an abundance of caution and with the assistance of third-party forensics, began an extensive review of the email account to determine whether it contained any sensitive information and if so, to whom the information relates. This review was completed on October 31, 2020, at which time AFMEPF searched its internal records to locate the addresses for the potentially affected individuals. This review was concluded on December 11, 2020.

What Information Was Involved?

The following types of information were found within the impacted email account: your name and <<breached elements>>. To date, we have no indication that any information has been subject to actual or attempted misuse in relation to this incident.

Upon discovery of this incident, we immediately took steps to secure the email account and launched an in-depth investigation with the assistance of outside cyber-forensic specialists to determine the full nature and scope of this incident. As part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy of personal information in our care, we reviewed our existing policies and procedures and implemented additional safeguards to further secure the information in our systems. We are also notifying regulatory authorities, as required by law.

Dear <<first_name>>:

The Archer School for Girls (Archer) is writing to notify you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud). This notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits, including Archer. On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified us and many other institutions that it had discovered an attempted encryption attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid the ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed by the unauthorized individual had been destroyed. The time period of unauthorized access was between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020. Blackbaud also reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation to determine what information was involved in the Blackbaud incident. Initially, Blackbaud informed us that the fields in the database backups containing personal information were encrypted and therefore not accessible by the unauthorized individual. However, Blackbaud's further investigation determined that was not the case, and informed us of its updated findings on September 29, 2020. We worked with Blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved and determined on November 10, 2020, that the backup files contained certain unencrypted information pertaining to you.

What Information Was Involved?

The backup file involved contained your <<b2b_text_1(Impacted Data)>>. Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused, disseminated, or otherwise be made available publicly.

What You Can Do.

While we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. If your health insurance or medical information was involved, it is also advisable to review the billing statements you receive from your health insurer or healthcare provider. If you see charges for services you did not receive, please contact the insurer or provider immediately.

On September 7, 2020, NBCC became aware of unusual activity on its network. NBCC conducted an immediate investigation and determined that the network was impacted by malware which prevented access to certain files on the system.

The unauthorized access occurred between August 31, 2020, to September 7, 2020. NBCC, with the assistance of the forensic specialists, began a thorough, lengthy, and labor-intensive process to identify sensitive information that may have been contained within impacted files and to identify the individuals whose information may have been impacted.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear Name,

We are writing to share with you some important information regarding an incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

What Happened?

On July 31, 2020, we detected unusual activity within two of our data centers and immediately launched an investigation. The investigation determined that records were acquired without authorization. The records were contained on Cunningham Lindsey data servers that were accessed without authorization between July 31 and August 2, 2020.

Due to the complex nature of the data involved, an extensive review was required to ascertain the types of data that may have been affected. This review was conducted as swiftly as possible but took months to complete. It was determined that your information may have been involved in the incident. As a result, we are contacting you to offer credit and identity monitoring services at no cost to you.

What Information Was Involved?

The information involved may have included your name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, Social Security or other governmental ID number, financial account information, medical related information, health insurance or medical ID number and/or other related employment records.

What We Are Doing.

As soon as we discovered this incident, we took the measures referenced above. We engaged in a thorough review of this incident and have undertaken efforts to minimize the likelihood of such an incident happening again.

We are also offering you the protection of one year of complimentary credit monitoring. While Identity Restoration assistance is immediately available to you, we also encourage you to activate the fraud detection tools available through Experian IdentityWorksSM. This product provides you with superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft. Please see the attached Experian document with the activation code.

Sedgwick works to protect the privacy of all individuals by continually refining our privacy and security programs and incident response procedures, regularly training of our employees, and conducting annual privacy assessments.

What You Can Do.

We recommend that you activate your complimentary Experian IdentityWorksSM services. Activation instructions are included with this letter. We also recommend that you review the guidance in this letter about how to protect your personal information.

Other Important Information.

By taking the following simple steps and availing yourself of the Experian services described above, you can further protect your personal information.

Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. You can receive free credit reports by placing fraud alerts and through your credit monitoring. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com, call 1-877-322-8228, or complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348.

You can also contact one of the following three national credit reporting agencies:

Equifax 1-866-349-5191 P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374-0241 www.equifax.com

Experian 1-888-397-3742 P.O. Box 9532 Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com

TransUnion 1-800-916-8800 P.O. Box 1000 Chester, PA 19016 www.transunion.com

You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled with Experian, notify them immediately by calling or by visiting their Member website and filing a theft report.

If you file a theft report with Experian, you will be contacted by a member of the Recovery Department who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned a Recovery Advocate who will work on your behalf to identify, stop, and reverse the damage quickly.

Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity: You should know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement.

Fraud Alerts: You may want to consider placing a fraud alert with the three credit bureaus. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing Page 3 a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information to place fraud alerts at all three bureaus is as follows:

Equifax Fraud Reporting 1-800-525-6285 P.O. Box 740241 Atlanta, GA 30374-0241 www.equifax.com

Experian Fraud Reporting 1-888-397-3742 P.O. Box 9532 Allen, TX 75013 www.experian.com

TransUnion Fraud Reporting 1-800-680-7289 Fraud Victim Assistance Division P.O. Box 6790 Fullerton, CA 92834-6790 www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods to place a fraud alert. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.

Security Freeze: By placing a freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. There is no cost for this service. Simply contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

You also have certain rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA): These rights include to know what is in your file; to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information; to have consumer reporting agencies correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information; as well as other rights. For more information about the FCRA, and your rights pursuant to the FCRA, please visit http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201504_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf.

Dear <<Name1>>:

Shift recognizes the importance of protecting the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your information. This letter explains the incident, measures we have taken, and steps you can take in response.

What Happened?

On September 18, 2020, we became aware of some unusual activity involving one of the third-party vendors that operates our website. We took immediate action to secure the system and investigate the situation, including engaging forensic investigators to assess what occurred. During the investigation, we discovered that an unauthorized third party accessed some of our cloud storage on September 17, 2020.

What Information Was Involved?

We completed a review of the contents of the impacted cloud storage; however, the investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized party actually viewed any specific data in the system.

What We Are Doing.

Upon discovering the unauthorized user, we made changes to our system to prevent that unauthorized party from further accessing our systems. To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we are taking steps to enhance our existing security program, implementing multiple layers of protective measures, ensuring that we follow best practices in the security of our data storage, and re-educating our staff in proper handling of secure data.

What You Can Do.

While we have no indication that your information was actually viewed by the unauthorized party, or that it has been misused, we wanted to notify you of this incident and remind you that it is always advisable to remain vigilant for signs of unauthorized activity by reviewing your financial account statements. If you see charges or activity you did not authorize, we suggest that you contact the provider immediately.

We are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information. Waters & Kraus, LLP takes the protection of personal information very seriously and we want to explain the incident, the measures we have taken in response, and some additional steps you may consider taking.

What Happened?

We recently discovered unauthorized access to certain employee email accounts. As soon as we discovered the incident, we took immediate steps to secure the email environment. A cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with the investigation and determined that an unauthorized party was able to access certain accounts between December 5, 2019, and May 15, 2020. Unfortunately, the investigation was not able to determine which emails and attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized party. Therefore, we conducted a thorough review of the contents of the email accounts involved to determine the specific individuals whose information was contained within the emails and attachments. We completed the review process on December 10, 2020, and then we analyzed the results and determined that an email or attachment in the account included some of your information.

Although we believe the unauthorized actor accessed the account to obtain information on the companies with which we do business, and not to obtain personal information on individuals, we are notifying you of this incident and steps you can take to protect your information out of an abundance of caution.

What Information Was Involved?

The information that may have been accessed included your <<b2b_text_1 (Impacted Data)>>.

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant, especially over the next 12 to 24 months, and review your account statements and credit reports closely. If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. You should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC).

Copy of Credit Report:

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348. You can also contact one of the following three national credit reporting agencies:

Chester, PA 19016

www.transunion.com

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

In some U.S. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:

You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We regret to inform you that our third-party fundraising software provider, Blackbaud, experienced a global data security breach earlier this year, which has impacted many of its clients around the world, including Wildwood School. Unfortunately, this incident involves the potential exposure of personal information of some of our community members.

The compromised data did not contain any credit card information or other personally identifiable information such as bank account information, usernames, passwords, or Social Security numbers.

While the cyber-attack did not occur at Wildwood School or as a result of any action on our part, we take the protection of our community's information very seriously and wanted to make you aware of the incident, what it may mean to you, and steps you can take to secure your information.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a software service provider used by non-profit companies, schools, and institutions. Earlier this year, Blackbaud was the subject of a ransomware attack, and the cyber-criminal may have had access to specific personal information identified below between February and May 20, 2020. Once Blackbaud detected the intrusion, it was able to halt further system access. As a result, the cyber-criminal only gained access to certain back-up files in specific Blackbaud solutions. Blackbaud, in conjunction with the FBI, investigated the incident and ultimately paid a ransom to the cyber-criminal under the assurance that any exfiltrated files would be destroyed, and their system was fully restored after ransom payment. Through vigilant monitoring post-incident, Blackbaud reports that there has been no evidence of improper use of any of the data files that may have been exposed. Blackbaud has already implemented changes to their data security protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.

What Was Exposed?

Wildwood received notice of this incident in July 2020, including information on the specific Blackbaud Solution back-ups exposed. We immediately took action to understand the potential exposure and scope of personal data and retained counsel to assist and advise. As a result of the ransomware attack, there was exposure of your first/last name, phone number, address, date of birth, and medical vaccination record. No other sensitive personal information or financial information was exposed, as all such information is encrypted.

What You Can Do:

We advise you to remain vigilant in reviewing your account statements, monitoring and placing a fraud alert on your free credit reports. Please refer to the enclosed information for the resources available to you, and the steps that you can take to further protect your personal information.

Security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file.

For More Information:

We recognize that you may have questions not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please call Kroll at 1-XXX-XXX-XXXX, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central Time. Kroll representatives have been fully versed on the incident and can answer questions or concerns you may have regarding protection of your personal information.

Fraud Alerts: You can place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus by phone and online with Equifax, TransUnion, or Experian. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. As of September 21, 2018, initial fraud alerts last for one year. Victims of identity theft can also get an extended fraud alert for seven years. The phone numbers for all three credit bureaus are at the bottom of this page.

Monitoring: You should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.

Security Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency. You may make that request by certified mail, overnight mail, regular stamped mail, or by following the instructions found at the websites listed below. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse or a minor under the age of 16, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. It is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. As of September 21, 2018, it is free to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. You may also place a security freeze for children under the age of 16. You may obtain a free security freeze by contacting any one or more of the following national consumer reporting agencies:

More information can also be obtained by contacting the Federal Trade Commission listed above.	The breach was caused by a ransomware attack on the third-party fundraising software provider, Blackbaud, which affected ALE Solutions Inc.

Dear Friend of Fairmont Private Schools,

We regret to inform you that one of our third-party vendors, Blackbaud, experienced a cyber incident that may have allowed access to some of your personal information. As a result, you are entitled to free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a software service provider that offers engagement and fundraising solutions to non-profit companies, schools, and institutions across the United States. Between February and May 20, 2020, Blackbaud was the victim of a ransomware attack, and the cyber-criminal may have had access to specific personal information, including your name, phone number, address, and Social Security or Tax Identification number. Blackbaud detected the intrusion and was able to halt further system access. The cyber-criminal only gained access to certain back-up files in specific Blackbaud solutions. Blackbaud, in conjunction with the FBI, investigated the incident and ultimately paid a ransom to the cyber-criminal under the assurance that any exfiltrated files would be destroyed. After the ransom payment, their system was fully restored. Through vigilant monitoring post-incident, Blackbaud reports that there has been no evidence of improper use of any of the data files that may have been exposed. Blackbaud has already implemented changes to their data security protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.

As part of their continuing investigation, Blackbaud discovered that when it merged data from previous versions of some of their solutions into current versions, there were hidden tables containing the older data (which included unencrypted Personal Information) merged into the new program which were not visible. We were notified of this new exposure on September 29, 2020, and took action to verify and determine scope, which required the cooperation of Blackbaud in producing the hidden data files. According to Blackbaud, the information was exposed because the company failed to destroy or encrypt certain legacy files after a migration of our files to a new platform.

What PI Was Exposed?

At this time, we are informed that sensitive personal information, including your name, phone number, address, and Social Security or Tax Identification number, was exposed. This is older data from the prior legacy versions of the programs that were used prior to migration.

What You Can Do:

To help you guard against identity theft or other potential fraud as a result of this incident, Blackbaud is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services for 24 months. Information about how to access these services accompanies this letter. Although services are available to you, it is important to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspected fraud to law enforcement. For information on avoiding identity theft, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

In addition, security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file.

We encourage you to contact CyberScout to enroll in free CyberScout services by going to https://www.cyberscouthq.com/epiq263?ac=263HQ1329 and using the Enrollment Code provided above. Please note the deadline to enroll is March 1, 2021.

Again, at this time, there is no evidence that your information has been misused. However, we encourage you to take full advantage of this service offering. Enclosed hereto you will find additional information regarding the resources available to you, and the steps that you can take to further protect your personal information.

For More Information:

If you have additional questions, please call Kroll at 1-???-???-????, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central Time. Kroll representatives have been fully informed about the incident and can answer questions or concerns you may have regarding protection of your personal information.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: Notice of Data Breach

Dear (Name),

We are writing to inform you about a data security breach that may have affected your personal information. At St. Francis Catholic High School, we take the protection and proper use of your personal information very seriously. This letter will explain the incident and provide you with steps you can take to protect yourself.

What Happened

Blackbaud, one of our third-party vendors and one of the world's largest providers of software for nonprofits, universities, and K12 schools, used by more than 25,000 organizations in more than 60 countries, notified St. Francis of a security breach. Blackbaud stated that its CyberSecurity Team, together with forensics experts and law enforcement, successfully prevented the cybercriminals from blocking Blackbaud's access. They discovered and stopped the ransomware attack. However, prior to locking the cybercriminal out, it appears a copy of a 2007 backup file containing some of your personal information was removed.

Blackbaud paid the cybercriminals' demand with confirmation that the copy removed has been destroyed. Based on the nature of this incident, their research and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. Initially, Blackbaud assured clients that no personal information had been exposed because it was encrypted. After further investigation, Blackbaud disclosed that some personal information left behind in legacy files had not been encrypted.

What Information Was Involved

It is important to note that the cybercriminal did not access your credit card information. However, it has been determined that the file removed may have contained your daughter's name, date of birth, and Social Security number.

What Blackbaud Is Doing

As part of ongoing efforts, Blackbaud states that it has already implemented several changes that will protect your data from any subsequent incidents. First, its teams identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and took action to fix it. Blackbaud has tested its fix with multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, and assured us that it withstands all known attack tactics. They also are accelerating their efforts to further protect data through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint, and network-based platforms.

What We Are Doing

We are notifying affected families about this incident. We are continuing to work with Blackbaud to make sure that no sensitive data has been removed from the database. We have no reason to believe the information has been misused or made available publicly, but we encourage you to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement.

Services

Blackbaud is providing you with access to Single Bureau Credit Monitoring* services at no charge. Services are for 24 months from the date of enrollment. When changes occur to your Experian credit file, notification is sent to you the same day the change or update takes place with the bureau. In addition, we are providing you with proactive fraud assistance to help with any questions you might have. In the event you become a victim of fraud, you will also have access remediation support from a CyberScout Fraud Investigator. In order for you to receive the monitoring service described above, you must enroll within 90 days from the date of this letter.

Proactive Fraud Assistance.

For sensitive breaches focused on customer retention, reputation management, or escalation handling, CyberScout provides unlimited access during the service period to a fraud specialist who will work with enrolled notification recipients on a one-on-one basis, answering any questions or concerns that they may have. Proactive Fraud Assistance includes the following features:

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear <<Name 1>>,

We are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information. On August 17, 2020, certain computer systems were infected with malware that encrypted the data on those machines. We quickly identified and contained the malware, restored systems from available backups, and launched an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm which was engaged on our behalf. On September 24, 2020, we learned that an unauthorized party had gained access to some of our systems that contained personal information of our customers.

The investigation was unable to determine what, if any, data was accessed by the unauthorized party. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying all customers and patients whose personal information was stored in the systems that were accessed by the unauthorized party. The stored information that was potentially accessible includes your name, Social Security number, driver's license number, and/or financial account information.

As a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership from myTrueIdentity through TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion. The service is completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

In response to this incident, we have taken steps to help prevent a similar incident in the future, including updating user passwords and implementing additional security safeguards and controls in our network infrastructure.

When prompted, enter the six-digit telephone passcode <<Telephone Pass Code>> and follow the steps to enroll in the offline credit monitoring service, add an initial fraud alert to your credit file, or to speak to a TransUnion representative if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft.

You can sign up for the online or offline credit monitoring service anytime between now and <<Enrollment Deadline>>. Due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. Please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with TransUnion or an address in the United States (or its territories) and a valid Social Security number. Enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111

Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Fraud Alerts and Credit or Security Freezes:

Fraud Alerts: There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes: You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports?

There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com

TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com

Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze?

A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Dear [Patient],

Einstein Healthcare Network is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of our patients' information. Regrettably, we are writing to inform you that we recently identified and addressed a security incident that may have involved some of your information.

On August 10, 2020, we identified suspicious activity within a limited number of Einstein employees' email accounts. We immediately took steps to secure the email accounts, and a leading computer forensic firm was engaged to assist with our investigation.

The investigation indicated that an unauthorized person gained access to the employee email accounts between August 5, 2020, and August 17, 2020. The investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized person actually viewed any emails or attachments in the email accounts.

Out of an abundance of caution, we reviewed the contents of the email accounts to identify patient information that was contained in the email accounts. As a result of that review, we identified one or more emails and/or attachments that may have included your name, date of birth, Social Security number, medical record or patient account number, health insurance information, and/or treatment or clinical information, such as diagnosis, medications, provider, type of treatment, or treatment location.

There is no evidence that any of your information was actually viewed by the unauthorized person, or that it has been misused. However, we wanted to notify you of this incident and assure you we take this very seriously.

As a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership of Experian IdentityWorksSM Credit 3B. This product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection support focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft.

The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report.

Should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

Recommended Steps to help Protect your Information

1. Website and Enrollment. Go to https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your Enrollment Code provided at the top of the letter.

2. Activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your IDX identity protection membership. The monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. Note: You must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. If you need assistance, IDX will be able to assist you.

3. Telephone. Contact IDX at 1-800-939-4170 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. Under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. To obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. If you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in IDX identity protection, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the IDX website and filing a request for help. If you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our ID Care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. In the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an ID Care Specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. You should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. Please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. A police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. You can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the Attorney General.

5. Place Fraud Alerts with the three credit bureaus. If you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. You can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via Experian's or Equifax's website. A fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. For that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. The contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

Credit Bureaus
Equifax Fraud Reporting
1-866-349-5191
P.O. Box 105069

TransUnion Fraud Reporting
1-800-680-7289
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

It is necessary to contact only ONE of these bureaus and use only ONE of these methods. As soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. You will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. An initial fraud alert will last for one year.

Please Note: No one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. Security Freeze. By placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. You will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. Keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. There is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. You can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. The Federal Trade Commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.

Steps you can take to protect against potential misuse of personal information

Always remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft, including by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions.

In addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your Attorney General, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To learn more, you can go to the FTC's Web site, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338) or write to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:

Obtain additional information from the FTC and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes. You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. In addition, you can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a security freeze to restrict access to your credit report:

(1) Equifax (800) 685-1111
(2) Experian (888) 397-3742
(3) TransUnion (888) 909-8872

You will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information. After receiving your request, each credit reporting agency will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN or password that you will need in order to lift or remove the freeze. You should keep the PIN or password in a safe place.

What Happened

Since 1912, the officers, directors, and staff of the Brotherhoods Relief & Compensation Fund have worked tirelessly to serve the membership. The Fund has faced many challenges through the years, and we know that will always be the case. Unfortunately, the latest challenge occurred when the Fund became the target of a cyber-attack on January 3, 2021. The Fund immediately launched a system recovery effort and engaged the services of a highly recommended digital forensic investigation firm. Unfortunately, the results of the investigation cannot identify the criminals responsible.

What Information Was Involved

What We Are Doing

The Fund has conducted a review of system security. We have deployed additional, redundant safeguards to protect member information. We are also reassessing our business relationships with several information technology providers.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Re: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<Name 1>>:

San Francisco Conservatory of Music (SFCM) is writing to make you aware of a data privacy event at our third-party vendor, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud), that may affect the privacy of some of your personal information. Blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to organizations, including SFCM. This notice provides information about the Blackbaud incident, SFCM's response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

SFCM received information from Blackbaud that it experienced an attempted ransomware incident that impacted certain Blackbaud systems. Blackbaud reported the incident to law enforcement and worked with forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incident. Blackbaud's investigation determined that an unknown actor may have accessed or acquired certain Blackbaud customer data. Blackbaud further reported that data was exfiltrated by the threat actor at some point before Blackbaud locked the threat actor out of the environment on May 20, 2020. SFCM received a supplemental notification from Blackbaud on September 29, 2020, that this incident impacted personal information related to SFCM. Upon receiving this notification, SFCM immediately commenced an investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive SFCM data was potentially involved. This investigation included working diligently to obtain further information from Blackbaud to understand the scope of the incident and the data that may have been affected. Using lists of potentially impacted individuals supplied by Blackbaud in October 2020, SFCM reviewed internal records to compare the information provided by Blackbaud with internal records and confirm the identities and contact information for individuals whose personal information may have been impacted by this event. The identity and address research was completed on or about December 11, 2020. Upon completion of the internal review, SFCM worked to prepare a complete list of individuals requiring notice of this event. This final list of affected individuals was completed on or about January 8, 2021.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation, and that of Blackbaud, determined that the involved Blackbaud systems contained your name and <<impacted data elements>>.

What We Are Doing.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care are among our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information in our care, we are working to review our existing policies and procedures regarding our third-party vendors, and are working with Blackbaud to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future.

We are also offering you access to complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services for 24 months through CyberScout. These services include fraud consultation and identity theft restoration services. Enrollment instructions can be found in the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information.

What You Can Do.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and credit reports for suspicious activity. You may also review the information contained in the attached Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information. There you will also find more information on the credit monitoring and identity protection services we are making available to you.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>:

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident affecting SN Servicing Corporation (SN) that has resulted in the exposure of some of your personal information. This letter contains information about the incident, steps we are taking to address the matter, and steps you can take to protect your personal information. Although we are not aware of the misuse of any of your information, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this incident may cause.

What Happened

On or about October 15, 2020, SN experienced a cybersecurity attack known as ransomware. During a ransomware attack, cyber attackers attempt to digitally lock a company's data and hold it for ransom. In response to the Incident, SN immediately locked down affected systems and engaged a third-party team of forensics experts to determine the potential impact to our borrowers. In addition, SN immediately notified the appropriate authorities of the Incident.

What Information Was Involved

Based on the preliminary results of the investigation, we determined that some of your information has been acquired by the individual(s) responsible for the incident.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: We are writing to inform you of a potential exposure of your personal information due to an incident. On June 5, 2020, an unauthorized individual gained access to an Ardent Credit Union employee's email account. The incident was related to a specific interaction unrelated to your account, and we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution. Our investigation shows no misuse of your member information or that your information was accessed. However, the email account contained information gathered as part of normal business operations, which we recently determined in some cases included individuals' names, Social Security numbers, and/or driver's license numbers.

Ardent Credit Union immediately took steps to block the unauthorized access, evaluated security measures to prevent similar attempts in the future, and retained the services of an outside forensic vendor to investigate the incident. We established a dedicated member support hotline to help address any further questions you may have about the incident at 888-994-0271. We engaged Experian to provide credit monitoring services at no cost to you. Details about this are below.

We recommend reviewing the enclosed information outlining steps you can take to protect your information. As an additional protection, we are providing access to Experian's IdentityWorksSM identity and credit monitoring service at no cost to you.

You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348.

You may consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above.

You may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. A credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. If you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. Therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. There shall be no charge for a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

The Oakwood School is writing to notify you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud). This notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud notified us and many other institutions that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. The time period of unauthorized access was between February 7, 2020, to May 20, 2020. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, we conducted our investigation of the Blackbaud services we use and the information provided by Blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. Initially, Blackbaud informed us that the fields in the database backups containing personal information were encrypted and not accessible by the unauthorized individual. However, Blackbaud's further investigation determined that was not the case, and informed us of their updated findings on September 29, 2020. We worked with Blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved and determined on November 12, 2020, that the backup files contained certain unencrypted information pertaining to you.

What Information Was Involved?

The backup file involved contained your name and Social Security number. Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What You Can Do:

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. As a precaution, Blackbaud is offering you a complimentary membership to Identity Monitoring and Fraud Resolution services for two years. This product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. These services are completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on the Identity Monitoring and Fraud Resolution services, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary two-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in the following pages.

What We Are Doing:

We are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that Blackbaud is taking in response. Blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

If you find anything you don't understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone number listed on the report.

Consider Placing a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File. You can place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost.

Dear <<Name>>:

At U.S. Bank, we place the privacy and security of your information as a top priority. We are writing to let you know about an event that occurred at a U.S. Bank location, which included some personal information that either you, a related person or related business client shared with us during an application process or as a result of a prior U.S. Bank acquisition. The information may be several years old, dating back 10 years or more.

What happened:

A computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. Since the event, we have been focused on identifying who may have been impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

What information was involved:

The information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name and Social Security number. At this time, we are not aware the information has been accessed or is being used fraudulently.

What are we doing:

We want to let you know of some steps we have taken to protect you and some additional steps you can take to help protect yourself.

Free credit monitoring and identity restoration services

To help you protect your identity, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (myTrueIdentity) for two years provided by TransUnion Interactive, a subsidiary of TransUnion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.

Whether or not you enroll in credit monitoring, we recommend that you place a Fraud Alert on your credit file.

Call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your Fraud Alert: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your Fraud Alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately.

Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

If you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. Get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. You also should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.ID.THEFT (877.438.4338). Your complaint will be added to the FTCs Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. Also visit the FTCs website at ftc.gov/idtheft to review their free identity theft resources such as their comprehensive step-by-step guide Identity Theft - A Recovery Plan.

Free credit-security freeze information

You can request a free Security Freeze (aka Credit Freeze) on your credit file by contacting each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies via the channels outlined below. When a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. A credit freeze can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

Syracuse University values the privacy and security of the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you may consider taking in response.

What Happened?

The University recently concluded its investigation of an incident that involved unauthorized access to one employee's email account. Upon first suspecting unauthorized access to the employee's email account, we immediately secured the account and launched an investigation with assistance from a cybersecurity firm. In connection with that investigation, we learned that an unauthorized party gained access to the employee's email account between September 24, 2020, and September 28, 2020. Our investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized party actually viewed any emails or attachments in the account.

What Information Was Involved?

In an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments contained in the email account to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized party. On January 4, 2021, we determined that an email and/or attachment contained your <<b2b_text_1(ImpactedData)>>.

What We Are Doing

We regret any concern this incident may cause you. To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we have implemented additional data security measures to enhance the security of our network, including hiring additional resources for cybersecurity training and providing additional training on cybersecurity and phishing for all of our employees with access to personal information.

What You Can Do

To date, we are unaware of any misuse of the information maintained in the employee's email account, nor do we have any evidence that any emails or attachments containing your information were actually viewed. However, we want to inform you of this event, assure you that we take this very seriously, and provide you with ways to protect your information. As a precaution, we have secured the services of Experian to offer you a complimentary one-year membership in Experian's IdentityWorksSM. This product helps detect possible misuse of your information and provides you with identity protection support focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorks is completely free, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score.

We are writing to inform you about a data breach incident involving your personal information maintained by Traffic Solutions Corporation, doing business as Statewide Safety Systems (Statewide), with regard to your employment. Statewide values and respects the privacy of its workers, which is why we are providing notice to you about the incident and the tools you can use to protect yourself against possible identity theft or fraud.

On January 7, 2021, Statewide discovered that a file containing the personal information of some Statewide employees was recently found on a thumb drive recovered by law enforcement in the home of a former Statewide employee. We have determined that the file containing the personal information was downloaded from Statewide's systems onto the thumb drive shortly before the individual's employment was terminated in June of 2018. Law enforcement discovered the file on the thumb drive as part of the investigation into crimes unrelated to Statewide. The individual has been arrested and charged by law enforcement. The former employee was not authorized to acquire Statewide's information during the individual's employment, and we consider the unauthorized acquisition to be a theft. Statewide has determined that your personal information was contained in the file located on the thumb drive. Law enforcement is currently in possession of the thumb drive, and we are unaware of any copies of the file made by the individual. Furthermore, we are not aware of any facts indicating that the personal information stolen by the individual has been shared, sold, or otherwise used by the individual since the unlawful acquisition in 2018. Our investigation is ongoing.

Upon discovery of this event by law enforcement, Statewide promptly engaged legal counsel to assist with the investigation and has worked with law enforcement to investigate the incident. Based on our investigation, we believe the unauthorized acquisition occurred in June of 2018. We are continuing to investigate whether the former employee engaged in other unauthorized activities and are continuing to assist law enforcement in its investigation.

If you are receiving this letter, Statewide has determined that you are part of the group of individuals whose personal information was contained on the thumb drive recovered by law enforcement. The information impacted includes your first and last name, date of birth, Social Security number, and other information related to your employment, including your hire date, termination date (if applicable), hours worked, and 401k allocations as of approximately June of 2018.

As a precautionary measure, Statewide is providing each potentially impacted employee with free credit monitoring service through Experian for 12 months. For more information on identity theft prevention and IdentityWorks Credit 3B, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this letter. In the meantime, we encourage you to take the following steps to further protect your information:

1. Closely monitor your financial account and promptly contact your financial institution if you notice any unusual activity.
2. Report incidents of suspected identity theft to your local law enforcement, the Federal Trade Commission, and your state attorney general. To file a complaint with the FTC, go to IdentityTheft.gov or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338). Complaints filed with the FTC will be added to the FTC's Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, which is a database made available to law enforcement agencies. Information on how to contact your state attorney general may be found at www.naag.org/naag/attorneys-general/whos-my-ag.php.
3. Take advantage of additional free resources on identity theft. We recommend that you review the tips provided by the Federal Trade Commission's Consumer Information website, a valuable resource with some helpful tips on how to protect your information. Additional information is available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/privacy-identity-online-security. For more information, please visit IdentityTheft.gov or call 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338).

Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348.
5. Place a security freeze on your credit files by calling each of the three credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). Freezing credit files will prevent someone from using your personal information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. Please understand that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card unless you temporarily or permanently remove the freeze.

Dear [Recipient],

We are writing to inform you about a recent cyber event that occurred on our Carnival Cruise Line website. On October 13, 2020, we posted information about the event and have been working diligently to identify individuals whose personal information may have been impacted. We are directly notifying you because your personal information was found during this process.

What Happened?

On August 15, 2020, we detected unauthorized third-party access to portions of our information technology systems. We acted quickly to shut down the intrusion, restore operations, and prevent further unauthorized access. We engaged a major cybersecurity firm to investigate the matter, and law enforcement and appropriate regulators were notified about the incident.

What Information Was Involved?

It appears that in early August, the unauthorized third-party gained access to certain personal information relating to some of our guests, employees, and crew. The impacted information includes data routinely collected during the guest travel booking process, during the casino experience, or through the course of employment. That information may include names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and dates of birth, and in some limited instances, additional personal information, such as Social Security or national identification numbers, health information, or other personal information.

Working with our cybersecurity experts, the Company took steps to recover its files and has evidence indicating a low likelihood of the data being misused.

What We Are Doing.

As part of our ongoing security operations, we regularly review our security and privacy policies and procedures and implement changes when needed to enhance our information security and privacy program and controls. For the benefit of those whose personal information may have been impacted, we are also offering individuals free credit monitoring and identity theft detection services for 12 months through CyberScout. Details on how to access free credit monitoring and identity theft detection services are in the enclosed Appendix A.

What You Can Do.

It is always a good idea to remain vigilant against threats of identity theft or fraud. You can do this by regularly reviewing and monitoring your account statements and credit history for any signs of unauthorized transactions or activity.

Sincerely,

[Sender]	The data breach was caused by an unauthorized third-party who gained access to certain personal information on Granite Wellness Centers' information technology systems.

We are writing to inform you of a recent privacy issue at Grand River Medical Group, P.C. (Grand River). We take patient privacy very seriously and understand that your personal information is important to you.

What Happened

An unauthorized individual gained access to an employee's email account, potentially allowing them to view documents containing certain personal information. Once the intrusion was discovered, Grand River immediately terminated the unauthorized individual's access to any part of our system. Grand River promptly engaged outside incident response experts to conduct a forensic analysis of the incident to determine whether any data was accessed or downloaded by the intruder. The forensic analysis did not reveal any evidence of data access or exfiltration, but we could not definitively rule such activity out, so we are providing you notice out of an abundance of caution. Because we believe some of your personal information was included in the documents, we are notifying you of the incident.

What Information Was Involved

The documents contained the following information: First Name, Last Name, Guarantor Name (Usually Patients Name), Full Address, Patients Balance, Balance Type, Indicates Patient Claim Amount, and Claim Status Code (Indicates Patient). Please note that no social security numbers or any financial information was included on the documents that may have been accessed.

What We Are Doing

As soon as Grand River discovered what happened, we immediately terminated access to the account and began investigating. Our IT department analyzed the entire network for any unauthorized activity. In addition, we hired an outside forensic incident response team which specializes in these types of incidents to determine the extent of the breach. We immediately changed all relevant passwords, added multi-factor authentication, and isolated the compromised account from the system. We have implemented all additional safeguards recommended by our third-party forensic consultants in order to prevent similar attacks in the future. While we do not have any evidence to suggest that your personal information was actually accessed, exported, or used by the attacker, we recognize that the information involved is sensitive and could be used to commit identity theft.

Identity Theft Protection Services

We are offering identity theft protection services through IDX, the data breach and recovery services expert. IDX identity protection services include months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. Please note that credit monitoring services are not available for minor children because children typically do not have a credit file before 18 years of age. With this protection, IDX will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised. We have no evidence to suggest that your information has been misused at this time, but we encourage you to take full advantage of these identity theft protection services.

To enroll, please call 833-764-1663 or visit https://response.idx.us/enrollgrmg.

Recommended Steps to Help Protect Your Information

3. Telephone. Contact IDX at 833-764-1663 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. Review your credit reports. We recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports.

This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources: You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state attorney general about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the attorney general in your state. Residents of Maryland, North Carolina, and Rhode Island can obtain more information from their attorneys general using the contact information below.

Personal Information of a Minor: You can request that each of the three national credit reporting agencies perform a manual search for a minor's Social Security number to determine if there is an associated credit report. Copies of identifying information for the minor and parent/guardian may be required, including birth or adoption certificate, Social Security card, and government-issued identification card. If a credit report exists, you should request a copy of the report and immediately report any fraudulent accounts to the credit reporting agency. You can also report any misuse of minor's information to the FTC at https://www.identitytheft.gov/.

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

We are writing to inform you that there may have been a breach of some of your personal information held by Sutter Buttes Imaging Medical Group (SBI) for diagnostic imaging services performed at Sutter Buttes Imaging Center, 945 Shasta Street, Yuba City, CA.

In December 2020, we discovered that third-party IT hardware used by SBI had vulnerabilities that allowed unauthorized access between July 2019 and December 2020. After a thorough investigation, SBI determined that certain patient information may have been accessed by unauthorized parties during that time. The information that may have been accessed includes the study date, patient name, date of birth, type of imaging procedure, and patient and study number (both internal numbers created by SBI).

It is important to note that the information potentially exposed did not include social security numbers, credit card numbers, or any medical diagnoses, medical images, or medical reports or notes.

SBI takes privacy and security matters very seriously. We conducted a thorough investigation and took several critical steps to address the identified IT vulnerabilities and to prevent a similar incident from happening again. SBI closed certain firewall ports to prevent future access and also engaged third-party IT consultants to perform a thorough analysis and bolster our security controls going forward.

We care deeply about protecting your personal information and understand the concern that this situation may cause. Although we have not uncovered evidence to suggest that your information has been inappropriately disclosed or used, we wanted to alert you of the incident and its relevance to you.

We have attached a list of additional resources commonly used to protect against identity theft or fraud.

We sincerely apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience it may cause you. If you have questions or concerns regarding this matter, please call 1-855-763-1159, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. PT. (Closed on U.S. observed holidays).

Sincerely,

Sutter Buttes Imaging Medical Group, Inc.

Actions to Help Reduce Your Chances of Identity Theft:

PLACE A FRAUD ALERT ON YOUR CREDIT FILE

An initial security alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a victim of fraud. When you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit on an existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the lender should take steps to verify that you have authorized the request. If the creditor cannot verify this, the request should not be satisfied. There is no cost to you to place a fraud alert and it remains on your credit file for at least one year. You may contact one of the credit reporting companies below for assistance.

USE TOOLS FROM CREDIT PROVIDERS

Carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card, and other account statements. Be proactive and create alerts on credit cards and bank accounts to notify you of activity. If you discover unauthorized or suspicious activity on your credit report or by any other means, file an identity theft report with your local police and contact a credit reporting company. You may also contact your state Attorney General if you believe you have been the victim of identity theft.

REVIEW YOUR EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS STATEMENT

Regularly review the explanation of benefits statement(s) that you receive from your health care providers or health plan. If you see any service that you believe you did not receive, you should contact your health care provider or health plan at the telephone number listed on the explanation of benefits statements.

Please read this entire letter.

As a company, we respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know about a data security incident that occurred on December 28, 2020, that may involve your personal information. The personal information that may have been exposed includes your name, address, phone number, birthdate, social security number, and salary. Although all indications are there was no actual misuse of your information, we are providing notice to you and all potentially affected employees about the incident, and about what we are doing to best mitigate the situation. Please be assured that we have taken every step necessary to address the incident and we continue to make every effort to improve the security of your personal information.

Based on our investigation, which commenced on or about January 14, 2021, we discovered that an individual who previously worked for us (the Former Employee) may have received a report containing personal information of other current and previous Abacus employees (the Report). Specifically, on December 28, 2020, the Former Employee downloaded the Report from PayCom containing personal information of other Abacus employees. At the same time, the Former Employee also inadvertently sent the Report to his/her personal email account. While this Former Employee was permitted to access employment-related information to perform duties while employed, the Former Employee was not authorized to send any Abacus employee-related information to his/her personal email account. We have conducted an investigation and have taken actions to ensure the Report containing Abacus employees' personal information was not accessed, opened, downloaded, saved, copied, forwarded, or shared and that any instance of the email containing the Report had been deleted from the Former Employee's email server. Additionally, we have obtained a sworn statement from the Former Employee under penalty of perjury that the Report was not accessed, opened, downloaded, saved, copied, forwarded, or shared and that any instance of the email containing the Report had been deleted from the Former Employee's email server. We have also implemented additional internal controls and safeguards to prevent a recurrence of this type of data breach going forward.

On June 24, 2020, Elwyn's Information Technology Department discovered suspicious activity in some employee email accounts. Elwyn launched an investigation with the assistance of computer forensics specialists to determine the nature and scope of the intrusion. Elwyn also took steps to secure the email accounts by resetting user passwords associated with the activity while continuing to investigate the problem.

Re: Scheduling Software Data Incident

Dear Valued Customer,

We have recently been informed by Avianis, our third-party scheduling software provider, of a data incident. This incident has regrettably impacted Jet Aviation and a number of other operators using the system.

Our IT, Security, and Operational Teams have been working closely with Avianis to ascertain the impact and determine next steps. At this stage, we understand certain categories of personally identifying data may have been compromised, notably passport, travel visa, and driver's license information. However, we do not believe that flight plans, passenger manifest details, and payment transactions have been compromised.

Avianis has notified local and Federal authorities of the incident and has assured us it will provide us with regular updates. Importantly, Avianis informed us it has identified and addressed the vulnerability that allowed this specific event to occur and has also informed us and other operators it has taken necessary corrective actions to prevent such an incident from occurring again.

We understand the importance of your privacy and deeply regret the inconvenience caused by this issue. Should you wish to subscribe to a monitoring service at this time, we will bear that cost.

We take such issues very seriously and will continue to keep you informed as we receive further updates from Avianis. In the meantime, please feel free to contact us directly. Alternatively, should you wish to reach one of our team, please contact your personal Client Aviation Director or send us an email at Data-Support@JetAviation.com.

Thank you for your understanding and continued loyalty.

Dear <<Name 1>>,

We are writing to inform you of a recent data security event that may have affected the confidentiality of some of your personal information. This letter provides details of the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

On August 26, 2020, we discovered that certain computer systems in our environment were inaccessible. We immediately launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party computer forensic specialists to determine the full nature and scope of the event. We also notified federal law enforcement. Through this investigation, we determined that an unknown actor gained access to certain systems between August 21, 2020, and August 30, 2020. The investigation determined that certain files on those systems were accessed and acquired by the unknown actor.

We then worked with third-party specialists to perform a comprehensive review of the contents of the affected systems to determine what personal information was contained in the systems and to whom the information related. Upon completion of the third-party review, we then conducted an exhaustive manual review of our records to determine the identities and contact information for potentially impacted individuals. On January 22, 2021, we confirmed address information for affected individuals to provide notifications.

We determined that the following types of information related to you may have been accessed and acquired by the unknown actor during this incident: name, <<Data Elements>>.

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care is one of our highest priorities. Upon discovering this incident, we immediately took steps to further secure our systems and conduct an investigation. As part of our ongoing commitment to the security of personal information in our care, we are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to include additional safeguards. Although we do not have any indication of identity theft or fraud as a result of this incident, we are offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Transunion for 12 months at no cost to you as an added precaution. We also notified state regulators, as required.

We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, review your account statements, monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity, and to report any suspicious activity immediately to your bank or financial institution. Additional information and resources are included in the enclosed Steps You May Take To Help Protect Personal Information. You may also enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services available to you. Enrollment instructions are attached to this letter.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Breach

Harvard Eye Associates and Alicia Surgery Center value our patients and their privacy. That is why we are writing you this letter together to let you know about an incident that involved your personal information.

What Happened

Harvard Eye Associates contracts with a vendor for online data storage. On January 15, 2021, the vendor notified Harvard Eye that hackers had accessed the vendor's computer system and taken some of our data.

The vendor informed Harvard Eye that the hackers had demanded money to return the data they had taken. After consulting with cybersecurity experts and the FBI, the vendor made the payment. The hackers then returned the data and told the vendor that they had not disclosed the data or kept any copies. The vendor determined, through its investigation, that the hackers might have been able to access Harvard Eye's data as early as October 24, 2020. The vendor's cybersecurity experts have been monitoring the internet and have not found any evidence that the hackers used or disclosed any of the data.

What Information Was Involved

The information taken by the hackers included some of Harvard Eye's own patient information. It also included information about patients of Alicia Surgery Center, which Harvard Eye was using in order to perform administrative services for the Surgery Center.

The data taken by the hackers might have included your name, address, phone number, email address, date of birth, medical history, health insurance information, medications, and information about treatment you received from Harvard Eye. If you have had eye surgery at Alicia Surgery Center, the data might also have included medical information related to your surgery.

The hackers did not have access to your social security number, driver's license number, other government ID number, or credit or debit card information.

What We Are Doing

When the vendor learned of this incident, it notified the FBI, hired cybersecurity experts, investigated, blocked further access by the hackers, and strengthened its security measures to help prevent future incidents.

At Harvard Eye and Alicia Surgery Center, we have taken steps to review and analyze the incident, and we will continue our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the security of our patients' data.

RE: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<Name 1>>:

Rakuten USA, Inc. DBA Rakuten Americas (Rakuten) is writing to inform you of a recent data security event that involves some of your personal information. We take this event seriously and are providing you with information about the incident and steps you may take to help protect your personal information, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

What Happened?

On or about January 21, 2021, Rakuten's data security team detected that an employee who was in the process of voluntarily leaving the company had transferred a number of files off their Rakuten-issued computer. As soon as we learned about this person's actions, we launched an investigation into the nature and scope of their activity. Our investigation revealed that some of these transferred files contained sensitive personal information of employees. This person had been authorized to access this information only on a Rakuten device for assigned work purposes. We immediately took steps to limit potential further exposure of the data, including, during an interview with the employee, deleting copies of the files from a personal device and account where they were discovered. Although we do not have any indication of misuse of the data at this time, we cannot be certain what occurred once the data was outside of our environment, including whether the data was further transferred or other copies were made. Rakuten has been in touch with law enforcement and is continuing to work to ensure the security of this information.

What Information Was Involved?

The information involved includes your name, Social Security number, and date of birth.

What We Are Doing in Response?

The security of information in our care is among our highest priorities. Although we do not have any knowledge of actual or attempted misuse of the exposed information at this time, we are notifying you so that you may take further steps to best protect yourself from potential harm. We are offering you access to complimentary credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration services through TransUnion, in which you can enroll using the information on the attached pages. In addition, we are providing notice to appropriate regulatory authorities.

RE: Important Security Notification

Please read this entire letter.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear [Insert customer name]:

We are contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred on January 31, 2021 at AxleHire, Inc. As a result, your personal information may have been potentially exposed to others. Please be assured that we have taken every step necessary to address the incident.

What Happened

When we were preparing the 1099 tax forms for our drivers in January 2021, there was a software glitch that resulted in some drivers receiving the wrong 1099 forms. The error was isolated, and therefore, only caused errors within a small random subset of our driver population. After the incident, we were able to determine which drivers received incorrect 1099 forms and will maintain this record internally in the event any issues arise in the future. In the meantime, we have contacted all drivers who received a 1099 form other than their own and have requested that they discard the information they received about other drivers.

What Information Was Involved

This incident involved your name, address, and Social Security number.

What We Are Doing

AxleHire has fixed the software issue above and sent out corrected 1099 forms to each driver. Furthermore, in order to avoid the opportunity for error in the future, AxleHire will instead post a password-protected 1099 for each driver within the driver app link accessible only under a driver's unique login credentials. To help further protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary two-year membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM.

What You Can Do

Monitor Your Accounts

You should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud, identity theft, and errors by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions, as major credit card companies have rules that restrict them from requiring you to pay for fraudulent charges that are timely reported. In addition, you are encouraged to contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), law enforcement, or your state attorney general to report incidents of suspected identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. You can contact the FTC at:

Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20580
(877) IDTHEFT (438-4338)
www.identitytheft.gov

If you find that your information has been misused, the FTC encourages you to file a complaint with the FTC and to take these additional steps, among others: (1) close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently; and (2) file and keep a copy of a local police report as evidence of the identity theft crime.

If you are a resident of Maryland or Oregon, please review Appendix B for additional information that may be applicable to you.

Obtain Your Credit Reports

You should also monitor your credit reports. You may periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide consumer reporting agency. If you discover inaccurate information or a fraudulent transaction on your credit report, you have the right to request that the consumer reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under federal law, you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. You also may complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form available from the FTC at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf, and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. You may also contact any of the three major consumer reporting agencies to request a copy of your credit report.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Breach

Harvard Eye Associates and Alicia Surgery Center value our patients and their privacy. That is why we are writing you this letter together to let you know about an incident that involved your personal information.

What Happened

Harvard Eye Associates contracts with a vendor for online data storage. On January 15, 2021, the vendor notified Harvard Eye that hackers had accessed the vendor's computer system and taken some of our data.

The vendor informed Harvard Eye that the hackers had demanded money to return the data they had taken. After consulting with cybersecurity experts and the FBI, the vendor made the payment. The hackers then returned the data and told the vendor that they had not disclosed the data or kept any copies. The vendor determined, through its investigation, that the hackers might have been able to access Harvard Eye's data as early as October 24, 2020. The vendor's cybersecurity experts have been monitoring the internet and have not found any evidence that the hackers used or disclosed any of the data.

What Information Was Involved

The information taken by the hackers included some of Harvard Eye's own patient information. It also included information about patients of Alicia Surgery Center, which Harvard Eye was using in order to perform administrative services for the Surgery Center.

The data taken by the hackers might have included your name, address, phone number, email address, date of birth, medical history, health insurance information, medications, and information about treatment you received from Harvard Eye. If you have had eye surgery at Alicia Surgery Center, the data might also have included medical information related to your surgery. The hackers did not have access to your social security number, driver's license number, other government ID number, or credit or debit card information.

What We Are Doing

When the vendor learned of this incident, it notified the FBI, hired cybersecurity experts, investigated, blocked further access by the hackers, and strengthened its security measures to help prevent future incidents.

At Harvard Eye and Alicia Surgery Center, we have taken steps to review and analyze the incident, and we will continue our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the security of our patients' data.

Fraud Alert:

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:

You have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze.

As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. There is no charge to place, lift, or remove the security freeze. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you, including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

Dear First Middle Last Suffix,

We are writing to inform you of a cybersecurity incident that occurred at Sequoia Capital Operations, LLC (Sequoia). We understand the importance of keeping personal information safe and secure, and we deeply regret that this incident has occurred. Below you will find information about what happened, what we are doing, and what you can do.

WHAT HAPPENED?

On or about January 20, 2021, we discovered that an unauthorized third party had gained remote access to the business email mailbox of one Sequoia employee, with the apparent aim of conducting a wire diversion scam. Our investigation has found no evidence of compromise beyond this single mailbox. We quickly took steps to secure our network and began to investigate the incident with the support of outside cybersecurity experts.

The unauthorized access to the mailbox might have allowed the third party to acquire a copy of files containing the personal information of fewer than 1,000 California residents. As part of our investigation, we have analyzed the contents of the affected email mailbox and determined that it contained your personal information, and that the unauthorized third party might have accessed or acquired a copy of it.

WHAT INFORMATION WAS INVOLVED?

Based on our review, the unauthorized third party could have acquired personal information including your <<Insert Exposed PII>>.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

We took prompt steps to address this incident, including contacting law enforcement and engaging outside cybersecurity experts to help remediate and ensure the ongoing security of our systems. As part of these ongoing efforts, we have enhanced cybersecurity protections throughout our environment to detect any future anomalous activity. Specifically, we have:

- Identified and remediated the configuration that permitted the initial access;
- Deployed additional prevention and detection technology at multiple layers to improve visibility into anomalous user activity and malicious email content;
- Reviewed the methods we use to store and share sensitive information inside and outside the company, including email message forwarding rules; and
- Refreshed our security training with additional emphasis on phishing awareness and proper data handling.

Out of an abundance of caution, Sequoia has also conducted dark web monitoring to determine whether any of the data from the business email mailbox is being sold or traded by cybercriminals, and we have not seen any indication that the email mailbox data is being exploited for any purpose.

To protect you further, we are offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Experian for 24 months, free of charge. You can find further details below on how to sign up.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

We strongly encourage you to contact Experian and take advantage of the credit monitoring and identity theft protection services we are providing to you free of charge. Remain vigilant and carefully review your accounts for any suspicious activity.

If you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should change the password and security questions associated with the account, and promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained and any relevant government agency, such as the IRS, SSA, or state DMV, as applicable.

If you would like to take additional	The data breach was caused by an unauthorized access to Sequoia Capital Operations, LLC's business email mailbox with the aim of conducting a wire diversion scam. The breach was not caused by any physical loss or insider of AxleHire Inc., but rather by an outside party gaining remote access to Sequoia's system. Therefore, this is a HACK-type breach.

Dear Sir or Madam:

We are writing on behalf of our client, IWI Motor Parts (IWI), to notify you of a security incident involving Iowa residents. IWI is a company in the automotive aftermarket business. IWI is headquartered in Dubuque, IA and also has operations in Illinois and Wisconsin.

IWI has conducted an investigation involving unauthorized access to some of its company servers. That investigation determined that the access occurred on October 31, 2020. Upon discovering the incident, IWI immediately took steps to secure its systems and launched an investigation with the assistance of a professional security firm to determine the nature and scope of the incident.

IWIs investigation determined that an unauthorized person accessed certain files on its servers and transferred at least some of those files outside of the network. On January 27, 2021, IWI determined that the files accessed and/or transferred out of its network by the unauthorized person contained information pertaining to certain individuals. On February 12, 2021, IWI determined that the information of 656 Iowa residents may have been accessed, including their names and one or more of the following: Social Security number and/or financial account number.

Beginning today, February 19, 2021, IWI is providing written notice to the Iowa residents via First Class U.S. Mail. A sample copy of the notification letter is enclosed. IWI is offering the Iowa residents whose Social Security numbers were involved a complimentary one-year membership in credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Kroll. IWI has also established a dedicated call center where all individuals may obtain more information regarding the incident.

To further protect personal information, IWI continues to review its systems and has implemented additional measures to further enhance and strengthen its existing security processes.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this incident.

Sincerely,

The computer system of The Kroger Co. was unsuccessfully attempted to be accessed by an unknown individual, leading to a subsequent investigation by a cybersecurity firm which discovered that personal information such as names, addresses, dates of birth, driver's license numbers, and Social Security numbers may have been accessed by an unauthorized individual.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: NOTICE OF DATA BREACH

We are writing to inform you about a data security incident that affected Accellion, which was used by the Kroger Family of Companies and many other companies for secure file transfers. This incident involved your personal information. At this time, we have no indication of fraud or misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident. Nevertheless, we are notifying you to explain the circumstances as we understand them, and to make you aware of the steps we have taken to respond and the resources we are making available to you.

What Happened?

We were recently made aware of a data security incident affecting Accellion, which was used by the Kroger Family of Companies, as well as many other companies, for secure file transfers. Accellion has confirmed that an unauthorized person gained access to certain Kroger Family of Companies files by exploiting a vulnerability in Accellion's file transfer service. We learned that the Accellion incident impacted Kroger's files on January 23, 2021, took immediate action, and we discontinued use of Accellion's services and investigated the scope and impact of the incident. The incident was isolated to Accellion's services, and our own IT systems have not been affected by this incident. No grocery store data was impacted. However, the Accellion software was used for secure file transfers of certain Kroger associate benefit information.

What Information Was Involved?

Our investigation into the scope of the incident is ongoing. However, we believe impacted information may include names, contact information, date of birth, and benefits information from the Kroger Employee Health Plan including your plan, prescription ID, and certain claims processing details. While grocery store systems or data were not impacted, customers of the Pharmacy or Little Clinic may receive a separate notice related to this incident if your pharmacy or clinic information was impacted.

What We Are Doing

The safety of your personal information is of utmost importance to us. We have discontinued the use of the Accellion service, reported the incident to federal law enforcement, and began an investigation to understand the scope and impact of the incident. In addition, we have arranged for any impacted associate to receive comprehensive credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Experian for two years at no cost to you.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<first_name>> <<last_name>> :

ITOCHU International Inc. (III) understands the importance of protecting the information we maintain. We are writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you may consider taking.

What Happened?
III recently concluded its investigation of an incident that involved unauthorized access to one employee's email account. Upon first suspecting unauthorized access to the employee's email account, we immediately secured the account and launched an investigation. A third-party cybersecurity forensics firm was engaged to assist.

In connection with that investigation, we learned that an unauthorized party gained access to the employee's email account between September 8, 2020, and September 9, 2020. Our investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized party actually viewed any emails or attachments in the account. In an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments that may have been viewed in the email account to identify individuals whose personal information may have been accessible to the unauthorized party.

What Information Was Involved?
On December 8, 2020, we determined that the account included an email and/or attachment containing your name and one or more of the following data elements: Social Security number, driver's license number, and/or financial account number.

What We Are Doing.
To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we have implemented additional security measures to enhance the security of our network, and we are retraining our employees concerning data retention and security.

What You Can Do.
While we have no indication that your information was actually viewed by the unauthorized person, or that it has been misused, we wanted to notify you of this incident.

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR IDENTITY MONITORING SERVICES
You have been provided with access to the following services from Kroll:

Triple Bureau Credit Monitoring
You will receive alerts when there are changes to your credit data at any of the three national credit bureaus—for instance, when a new line of credit is applied for in your name. If you do not recognize the activity, you will have the option to call a Kroll fraud specialist, who will be able to help you determine if it is an indicator of identity theft.

Fraud Consultation
You have unlimited access to consultation with a Kroll fraud specialist. Support includes showing you the most effective ways to protect your identity, explaining your rights and protections under the law, assistance with fraud alerts, and interpreting how personal information is accessed and used, including investigating suspicious activity that could be tied to an identity theft event.

Identity Theft Restoration
If you become a victim of identity theft, an experienced Kroll licensed investigator will work on your behalf to resolve related issues. You will have access to a dedicated investigator who understands your issues and can do most of the work for you. Your investigator will be able to dig deep to uncover the scope of the identity theft, and then work to resolve it.

Kroll's activation website is only compatible with the current version or one version earlier of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. To receive credit services, you must be over the age of 18 and have established credit in the U.S., have a Social Security number in your name, and have a U.S. residential address associated with your credit file.

ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE
We remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. To order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

Contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

Equifax, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
Experian, PO Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General's office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:

Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

Fraud Alerts:
There are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. You may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. An initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. You may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. A fraud alert is free. The credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an Active Duty Military Fraud Alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. The credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

Credit or Security Freezes:
You have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

How do I place a freeze on my credit reports?
There is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. Unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. For information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

Experian Security Freeze, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, www.experian.com
TransUnion Security Freeze, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, www.transunion.com
Equifax Security Freeze, PO Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348, www.equifax.com

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

How do I lift a freeze?
A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. If the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. If the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. Otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	The organization experienced unauthorized access to an employee's email account due to a third-party gaining access to the account between September 8th and September 9th, 2020. Personal information such as name, social security number, driver's license number, and/or financial account number was potentially accessible to the unauthorized party. The investigation was unable to determine whether any emails or attachments were viewed.
Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our vendors, Blackbaud, Inc. (Blackbaud). This notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. Blackbaud notified us and many other institutions on July 16, 2020, that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on Blackbaud's network in May 2020. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that there had been unauthorized access to its systems between February 7, 2020, and May 20, 2020, that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. Blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

Initially, Blackbaud informed us that the fields in the database backups containing personal information were encrypted and not accessible by the unauthorized individual. However, further investigation determined that this was not the case, and Blackbaud informed us of their updated findings on September 29, 2020. Following receipt of the notifications about the incident from Blackbaud, we launched our investigation and worked with Blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved. On November 17, 2020, we determined that the unencrypted Blackbaud backup file contained some of your information.

What Information Was Involved?

The Blackbaud backup file involved contained your name and Social Security number. Blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual, and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What You Can Do

Even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. As a precaution, Blackbaud is offering you a complimentary membership to Identity Monitoring and Fraud Resolution services for two years. This product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. These services are completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on the Identity Monitoring and Fraud Resolution services, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary two-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in the following pages.

What We Are Doing

We are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that Blackbaud is taking in response. Blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

Security Freeze: You also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency. You may make that request by certified mail, overnight mail, regular stamped mail, or by following the instructions found at the websites listed below. The following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse or a minor under the age of 16, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the Registry of Motor Vehicles.

Dear [Name]:

Santa Rosa Community Health (SRCH) recently experienced a security incident that may have impacted a limited amount of your protected health information (PHI), including your name and Social Security number. We value the privacy and confidentiality of your information and we sincerely apologize for any concern or inconvenience this may cause you. This letter contains information about steps you can take to protect your information and the resources we are making available to help you.

What happened?

We recently identified suspicious email activity associated with one of our corporate email accounts and engaged independent computer forensic experts to help us investigate this activity. As part of their investigation, we asked that they review all email accounts in our environment. This review found unauthorized access to one corporate email account that may have impacted your PHI. We engaged a vendor to conduct a comprehensive review of the affected email account and on December 30, 2020, we received a report from the vendor that identified the PHI that may have been stored in the account. We then expended significant time and effort to identify missing contact information and conduct other quality control checks on the data. This process concluded on January 20, 2021. Although we have no evidence that your information has been misused, we wanted to let you know about this incident out of an abundance of caution.

What information was involved?

The review of the email account and its contents determined that your name and Social Security number, in combination with one or more of the following data elements, may have been contained in the account: date of birth, address, health insurance and billing information, and diagnosis and treatment plan. Your bank account and other financial account information was not contained in the email account and remains secure.

What we are doing?

We want to assure you that we are taking steps to prevent this type of incident from happening in the future. We have performed a global password reset for all email accounts, increased our anti-malware and spam filters, implemented multi-factor authentication on all email accounts, and are currently retraining our employees on cybersecurity and on recognizing and responding to suspicious emails.

In addition, we are offering identity theft protection services through IDX, the data breach and recovery services expert. IDX identity protection services include: 12 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. With this protection, IDX will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised.

What you can do?

We encourage you to contact IDX with any questions and to enroll in free identity protection services by calling (833) 726-0930 or going to https://response.idx.us/srch and using the Enrollment Code provided above. IDX representatives are available Monday through Friday from 6 am - 6 pm Pacific Time. The deadline to enroll is May 26, 2021.

Re: Data incident

Dear [Original First Name] [Original Last Name]:

We are writing to inform you that, although you may or may not be a customer of The Hartford, you could have been impacted by recent unauthorized access to your personal information, as described below. Please know that the security of your personal information is of utmost importance to The Hartford and we take any incident involving that information seriously.

This letter is to notify you of the incident and our efforts to safeguard your personal information, and to provide you with resources you may use to protect yourself.

What Happened

We recently learned that unidentified persons used our public website to submit fraudulent request for auto insurance using the names and addresses and/or dates of birth of unknowing consumers. On January 26, 2021, we discovered that the unidentified persons, in the course of their fraudulent activity, may have misused our online auto insurance quote application to access your drivers license number. The fraudulent quote requests were made between December 2020 and February 3, 2021. Upon learning of this activity, we took immediate steps to prevent anyone from accessing this personal information, and worked to identify the potentially affected individuals.

We are notifying you and all consumers who we believe were impacted by the incident. However, we believe some people receiving this letter may have made valid quote requests on our website during the relevant time period. Therefore, if you or a member of your household did in fact submit an auto insurance quote request on our website between December 2020 and February 3, 2021, then it is possible that your information may not have been exposed in this incident.

What Information Was Involved

Based on our investigation, it appears your drivers license number may have been exposed in this incident.

What We Are Doing

As soon as we noticed the suspicious activity, we engaged both our internal teams and outside professionals to investigate, and we removed the ability to view drivers license number in the online quote application. We have also enhanced our safeguards to protect against further unauthorized access to the personal information.

We reported the fraudulent activity to law enforcement and regulatory authorities, as we continue to address this incident.

As further described below, we are offering, at no cost to you, a 2-year membership of Experian's IdentityWorks.

Review Your Account Statements and Notify Law Enforcement of Suspicious Activity

As a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely.

You also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, or the Attorney General, or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

At International Medical Corps, we understand the importance of protecting and securing the personal information we maintain. We are writing to notify you that we and many other institutions were notified by Blackbaud that it experienced a security incident. This notice explains the incident and the measures taken in response.

What Happened

Blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. Blackbaud notified us that it had discovered a ransomware attack on its network. Blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined there had been unauthorized access to its systems between February 7, 2020, to May 20, 2020, that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince Blackbaud to pay a ransom. Blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the removed files had been destroyed. Blackbaud reported that it had been working with law enforcement during the incident and investigation. Upon learning of the incident from Blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the Blackbaud services we use and the information provided by Blackbaud to determine what information may have been involved in the incident. We determined that the backup file contained certain information pertaining to you.

What Information Was Involved

The file contained your name and financial account information from a scanned check for the account ending in <<b2b_text_1(LastFourDigits)>>, as well as your <<b2b_text_2(ImpactedData)>>. Blackbaud assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

What You Can Do

Even though we have no evidence that your information has been or will be misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. As a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM. This product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. IdentityWorks is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. For more information on steps you can take in response and IdentityWorksSM, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided with this letter.

What We Are Doing

We are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that we, and Blackbaud, are taking in response. Blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect data, and are undertaking additional efforts to enhance the security of its network. Additionally, we want to assure you that International Medical Corps stopped the practice of storing unencrypted images of personal checks and other financial documents containing personal information prior to 2014. We also are undergoing a process of securing any remaining unencrypted financial documents that were previously saved in our database.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: Name: AB8861 v.04

RE: Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<Name 1>>,

Backroads is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect some of your personal information. You may have been affected due to being the dependent, spouse, or beneficiary of a current or former Backroads employee. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we want to provide you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect your personal information, should you feel it necessary to do so.

What Happened?

On October 2, 2020, Backroads became aware of suspicious activity within its computer network. Backroads immediately began an investigation, working with external forensic specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the activity. Our investigation determined that certain files within our environment were encrypted and inaccessible. On October 16, 2020, we discovered that certain files had been accessible to unknown actors and that certain personal information was contained in these files. We recognize that it may feel like there was a delay between the initial incident and receiving this notification. From the moment we knew that files were accessible to the unknown actors, we have been working both internally to determine who could have been affected, as well as externally with appropriate authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate globally. Thank you for your understanding and patience while we worked through all the necessary details.

What Information Was Involved?

Backroads has both legal authority and obligation to maintain personal information for its employees. The forensic investigation confirmed that the following information was stored within one of the impacted network devices and may have been accessible to unknown actors: your name, date of birth, Social Security number, government-issued ID (passport or driver's license, if provided to Backroads), financial account information, and health insurance information, if obtained through Backroads. While we cannot confirm which piece of your personal information might have been accessed, we are informing employees of the full scope of what could have been compromised due to its presence in impacted files.

What We Are Doing

The confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information within our custody are among Backroads' highest priorities. In order to minimize the chance that latent malware could remain on Backroads systems, we are rebuilding our network from the ground up and adding further security measures to better protect against similar incidents in the future.

What You Can Do

Please review the enclosed Steps You Can Take to Protect Personal Information, which contains information on what you can do to better protect against possible misuse of your information.

As an added precaution, Backroads is offering you access to one year of credit monitoring and identity protection services through TransUnion's myTrueIdentity (provided by Epiq) at no cost to you. Details of this offer and instructions on how to enroll in the services are enclosed within this letter.

You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least one year. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. If you have already been a victim of identity theft, you may have an extended alert placed on your report if you provide the appropriate documentary proof. An extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above.

You have the right to place a security freeze on your credit file free of charge. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze.

In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name; social security number; date of birth; current and previous addresses; a copy of your state-issued identification card; and a recent utility bill, bank statement or telephone bill.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is federal legislation that regulates how consumer reporting agencies use your information. It promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of consumer information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. As a consumer, you have certain rights under the FCRA, which the FTC has summarized as follows: you must be told if information in your file has been used against you; you have the right to know what is in your file; you have the right to ask for a credit score; you have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information; consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information; consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information; access to your file is limited; you must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers; you may limit prescreened offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report; you may seek damages from violators. Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights.

Fraud Alert:
You may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. An initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. Additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

Security Freeze:
Under U.S. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. This will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a PIN number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. As a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. You must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. In order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

Additional Free Resources:
You can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the FTC, or from your respective state Attorney General about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. You may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the FTC or to the Attorney General in your state.

Dear Friend of La Jolla Country Day School,

We are writing to inform you that one of our third-party vendors, Blackbaud, experienced a cyber incident that may have allowed access to some of your personal information. As a result, you are entitled to free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services.

What Happened?

Blackbaud is a software service provider that offers engagement and fundraising solutions to non-profit companies, schools, and institutions across the United States. Between February and May 20, 2020, Blackbaud was the victim of a ransomware attack that allowed a cyber-criminal to access certain personal information, including your name, phone number, address, birth date, and Social Security number. Once Blackbaud detected the intrusion, it was able to halt further system access. The cyber-criminal only gained access to certain back-up files in specific Blackbaud solutions. Blackbaud, in conjunction with the FBI, investigated the incident and ultimately paid a ransom to the cyber-criminal under the assurance that any exfiltrated files would be destroyed. Their system was fully restored after ransom payment. Blackbaud reports that there has been no evidence of improper use of any of the data files that may have been exposed. Blackbaud has already implemented changes to their data security protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.

As part of their continuing investigation, Blackbaud discovered that when it merged data from previous versions of some of their solutions into current versions, there were hidden tables containing the older data (which included unencrypted Personal Information) merged into the new program which were not visible. We were notified of this new exposure on September 29, 2020, and took action to verify and determine scope, which required the cooperation of Blackbaud in producing the hidden data files. According to Blackbaud, the information was exposed because the company failed to destroy or encrypt certain legacy files after a migration of our files to a new platform.

What PI Was Exposed?

At this time, we are informed that sensitive personal information, including your name, phone number, address, birth date, and Social Security number, were exposed. This is older data from the prior legacy versions of the programs that were used prior to migration.

What You Can Do:

To help you guard against identity theft or other potential fraud as a result of this incident, Blackbaud is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services for 24 months. Information about how to access these services accompanies this letter. Although services are available to you, it is important to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspected fraud to law enforcement. For information on avoiding identity theft, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

In addition, security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file.

We encourage you to contact CyberScout to enroll in free CyberScout services by going to https://www.cyberscouthq.com/epiq263?ac=263HQ1459 and using the Enrollment Code provided above. Please note the deadline to enroll is April 15, 2021.

Again, at this time, there is no evidence that your information has been misused. However, we encourage you to take full advantage of this service offering.

Enclosed hereto you will find additional information regarding the resources available to you, and the steps that you can take to further protect your personal information.

For More Information:

We recognize that you may have questions not addressed in this letter. If you have additional questions, please call our call center at 1-???-???-???? Monday through Friday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Pacific Time. Our representatives have been fully versed on the incident and can answer questions or concerns you may have regarding protection of your personal information.

La Jolla Country Day School values the security of your personal data, and we apologize for any inconvenience that this incident has caused.

Sincerely,

Dave Sigal
Chief Financial Officer

Upon this discovery, we continued to investigate the extent to which employee data was impacted in the event. Our investigation concluded on February 9, 2021, when we confirmed that certain information related to current and former employees was impacted during this event. While we are unaware of any actual misuse of your data stemming from this event, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution.

Contents of Data Breach Notification Letter: RE: Notice of Data Security Incident

Dear guest,

We are writing to inform you of a data security incident that has affected some Hurtigruten guests' information. Our investigations indicate that information for a limited number of guests who booked expedition voyages with two ships, MS Fram and MS Midnatsol, during a certain time period, has been affected by the incident. For MS Fram, the relevant time period is from 2018 to 2020. For MS Midnatsol, the relevant time period is from 2016 to 2020. We recently learned that your information has been affected by this incident.

What happened?

On December 14, 2020, we learned that an unauthorized actor gained remote access to our network and encrypted parts of our computer systems. At that time, however, we were unable to determine which guests may have been affected, if any, and what information might have been accessed. We immediately disabled affected computer systems, took down their internet connection to prevent any further intrusion, and launched a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. We understand that Hurtigruten was one of many companies that was a victim of this type of intrusion.

What Information Was Involved?

Based on our investigations, we have recently determined that your affected information involves:

- Name and date of birth;
- If you were sailing with MS Midnatsol, your passport number and passport expiration date; and
- For some guests, the affected information involves e-mail address, mailing address, and/or phone number.

Based on our investigations to date, the unauthorized actor did not gain access to your credit or debit card information, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, or other government-issued identification card numbers. Hurtigruten does not store credit or debit card information.

What We Are Doing?

As noted above, we immediately took steps to contain the issue and commenced an investigation to determine the data and individuals that may have been affected. We reported this matter to Norwegian law enforcement and the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (since Hurtigruten is based in Norway) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We also notified other applicable privacy regulatory authorities. Over the past years, we have made significant investments in data privacy and cybersecurity. Since this incident, we have further strengthened these efforts, and our internal experts are working closely with third-party cybersecurity experts to further enhance the security of our systems and reduce the risk of a similar event happening in the future.

What Can You Do?

On February 18, 2021, we discovered the unauthorized actor placed some of the above information on a difficult to access part of the web. We do not have any indication of actual harm to affected individuals as a result of this incident, but we still recommend you follow the enclosed additional steps that you can take to protect your personal information. We sincerely regret any concerns or inconvenience that this incident may cause you.

Re: Data Security Incident

Dear Director Whitney,

As outside counsel for Americold Realty Trust, a publicly traded REIT focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition, and development of temperature-controlled warehouses, we write to inform you of the recent discovery of a data security incident and to explain the steps the company has taken and continues to take to address it, including notifying potentially impacted individuals and providing them ways with which to protect their personal information.

On November 16, 2020, Americold determined that its computer network had been affected by a ransomware incident. The company immediately began an investigation to assess the incident's scope, engaging a third-party cybersecurity firm at the direction of counsel to assist. As a containment measure, the company preemptively shut down its systems and then undertook a secure, managed restoration from backup systems. The company also promptly notified law enforcement and has been cooperating with their investigation of the incident. In addition, the company has taken steps to further strengthen and enhance the security of systems in its network, including updating administrative and technical safeguards.

The company diligently has worked to complete its review of the potentially affected data, engaging external support to assist with the review and locating up-to-date address information. While this review was underway, on December 29, 2020, the company proactively sent letters to all current associates in the United States, offering them a complimentary two-year Consumer Protection Division membership of Experian's IdentityWorksSM, which provides identity theft detection and resolution services.

The company completed its review of the data on about February 19, 2021, and found personal information for 3,117 state residents in files that may have been accessed or acquired without authorization. The company is notifying this Office and the individual state residents and is providing them with complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft services for 24 months through Experian. The company also is sending follow-up notices to the individuals who received the December 29 letter. Unaddressed copies of each letter are attached. Those letters are to be mailed on March 4. In addition, the company has established a call center to answer consumer questions.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions regarding this letter.

Dear Sir or Madam:

We represent the American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association (AAFMAA), located at 102 Sheridan Avenue, Fort Myer, VA 22211, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some information relating to six hundred fifty-five (655) Iowa residents. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission.

By providing this notice, AAFMAA does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of Iowa law, the applicability of the Iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

Nature of the Data Event

On January 29, 2021, AAFMAA became aware of suspicious activity relating to its systems and immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the activity. AAFMAA determined that an unauthorized actor gained access to certain AAFMAA systems between January 28, 2021, and January 31, 2021, and removed and/or viewed certain files from the AAFMAA network. AAFMAA thereafter undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that were identified as impacted. The review of the files was completed on February 20, 2021.

The information that could have been subject to unauthorized access or acquisition includes name, address, Social Security number, and bank account information.

AAFMAA is providing access to credit monitoring services for twenty-four (24) months, through Experian, to individuals whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident, at no cost to these individuals. Additionally, AAFMAA is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank.

AAFMAA is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the Federal Trade Commission, their state Attorney General, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

Notice of Data Breach

Dear <<Name 1>>:

At the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association, we understand the importance of securing and protecting the personal information we maintain. I am writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your personal information. This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

What Happened

We recently completed an investigation into suspicious activity originating from one employee's email account on December 16, 2020. As soon as we became aware of the suspicious activity, we immediately took measures to secure the email account, contacted law enforcement, and launched an internal investigation. A cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist in a full forensic analysis of this incident. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person accessed the employee's email account at various times between December 3, 2020, and December 16, 2020.

What Information was Involved

Our investigation was unable to determine what messages, if any, were accessed. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive review of the mailboxes, and on February 1, 2021, determined that information stored in the email accounts may have contained your name, address, date of birth, passport number, and Social Security number.

What You Can Do

Though we have no indication that your information has been misused, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution and offering you a complimentary membership of Experian's IdentityWorks.
