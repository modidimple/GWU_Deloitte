1. nature of the security incident.

on april 4, 2020, iccs was first alerted to feedback received from several iccs website users who discovered that fraudulent purchases were made on their payment cards after using the www.mycountyparks.com website. iccs then quickly informed informatics, inc., the host of www.mycountyparks.com to investigate. on april 9, 2020, informatics alerted iccs that a technical investigation performed by informatics revealed previously undiscovered evidence that an unknown individual had placed a malicious code on www.mycountyparks.com as early as january 31, 2020. the malicious code was used to intercept payment card information of www.mycountyparks.com website users who made purchases on the website between the dates of january 31, 2020, and april 8, 2020. upon discovery, steps were taken to swiftly secure the iccs website, such as the removal of the malicious code. at this time, iccs and informatics have no evidence to indicate that the attacker responsible for the attack may have viewed or otherwise acquired any personal information of consumers affected by this incident other than their name, address, and payment card information.

2. number of iowa residents affected.

two thousand five hundred eighty (2,580) iowa residents were potentially affected by this security incident. an incident notification letter addressed to these individuals was mailed on may 4, 2020, by first-class mail. a sample copy of the notification letter is included with this letter.

3. steps taken.

informatics and iccs have taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future, and to protect the privacy and security of potentially impacted individuals' information. those steps include strengthening its cybersecurity posture, such as the removal of the malicious code that caused the incident, and providing potentially impacted individuals with timely notice of the incident and complimentary identity theft restoration and credit monitoring services for a period of twelve (12) months.

informatics and iccs remain dedicated to protecting the sensitive information in their control. if you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at anjali.das@wilsonelser.com or (312) 821-6164.

contents of data breach notification letter: re: notice of data breach

the city of fullerton (the city) is issuing this notice to inform individuals of a data privacy event that may have affected the security of personal information of some city residents and employees. the city takes this incident seriously and is providing individuals with information and resources to protect their personal information.

what happened?

the city discovered unauthorized posts on a public website containing confidential city information. an investigation was immediately launched to identify the source of the activity and confirm the security of the network. a third-party forensic investigator was also engaged to determine the nature and scope of the event. during the investigation, it was discovered that an internal data storage account was accessed by unauthorized users on multiple occasions from 2016 through june 21, 2019. the investigation revealed that the data included copies of emails and attachments containing certain protected information. as a precaution, the entire contents of the storage account were reviewed to identify the information that may have been accessible within the account. written notice was provided to individuals whose information was found in the data storage account. however, a small number of files present in the data storage account at the time of the access were not recovered and were unable to be reviewed.

what information is involved?

on october 25, 2019, written notice was provided to a small number of individuals whose sensitive information was found in the accessed data storage account. however, because a small number of files present within the data storage account were not able to be recovered, the city is providing this additional notification. the personal information that may have been present within these small number of files may include name and social security number, driver's license number, payment card information, medical or health information, and/or passport number. however, the city is unable to confirm the contents of these files or whether sensitive information was present in these files.

what are we doing?

the city takes the security of employee and citizen information seriously. the city immediately secured the account at issue, reviewed existing security measures, and is working diligently to implement additional security measures to ensure the security of the entire network. the city is also providing information about this event and about the steps individuals can take to help safeguard personal information. in addition, the city is offering identity monitoring services through kroll.

what you can do?

the city encourages individuals to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review their account statements, and to monitor their credit reports for suspicious activity. under u.s. law, individuals are entitled to one (1) free credit report annually from each of the three (3) major credit reporting bureaus. to order a free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. individuals may also contact the three (3) major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of their credit report. individuals have the right to place a security freeze on their credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in their credit report without express authorization. the security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in an individual's name without consent. however, using a security freeze to control who gets access to the personal and financial information in an individual's credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, an individual cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on their credit report. should an individual wish to place a security freeze, they should contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

dear <<first name>> <<last name>>:

impact mobile home communities (impact mhc) is writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the security of some of your personal information. while we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, this letter provides information about the incident and the resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

what happened?

on july 3, 2019, impact mhc became aware of suspicious activity relating to an employee email account. we immediately launched an investigation to determine what may have happened. working together with a leading computer forensics firm, our investigation determined that an unauthorized individual or individuals accessed several employee email accounts between july 1, 2019, and july 31, 2019. two of the email accounts were accessed between october 3, 2018, and july 8, 2019.

because we were unable to determine which email messages in the accounts may have been viewed or acquired by the unauthorized actor, we reviewed the entire contents of the impacted email accounts to identify what personal information was accessible to the unauthorized actor(s). due to the large volume of emails to be reviewed, this was a very lengthy and labor-intensive process. on february 27, 2020, we identified the individuals potentially impacted by this incident after a thorough programmatic and manual review of the email accounts. once we confirmed the individuals who were potentially affected, impact mhc worked to identify contact information for the impacted individuals and began preparing an accurate written notice of this incident.

what information was affected?

although we cannot confirm whether your personal information was actually accessed, viewed, or acquired without permission, we are providing you this notification out of an abundance of caution because such activity cannot be ruled out. the following types of your information were located in an email or attachment that may have been accessed or acquired by an unauthorized actor: your name and [variable text 2].

what are we doing?

information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. impact mhc has strict security measures in place to protect the information in our possession. upon learning of this incident, we quickly changed all employee email account passwords and took steps to secure the accounts. we are currently implementing additional technical safeguards and employee training to prevent similar future incidents.

what can you do?

although we are not aware of any fraudulent misuse of your information, we arranged to have id experts monitor your identity for 1 year at no cost to you as an added precaution. please review the instructions contained in the attached steps you can take to protect your information to enroll in and receive these services. impact mhc will cover the cost of this service; however, you will need to enroll yourself in the credit monitoring service if you would like to do so.

dear <<first name>> <<last name>>:

santa rosa & rohnert park oral surgery (sros/rpos) is writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the privacy of some of your personal health information. you are receiving this letter because you are a current or former patient of, or were previously referred to, sros/rpos. while we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, this letter provides details of the incident, our response, and resources available to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

what happened?

on march 11, 2020, sros/rpos learned of unusual activity in one of its email accounts. we immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the activity. the investigation determined that the email account was subject to unauthorized access between december 20, 2019, and march 11, 2020. although we have no evidence to suggest that specific information in the email account was accessed, in an abundance of caution, we undertook a comprehensive review of the entire contents of the email account to confirm the type of information contained in the account and to whom it related.

notice of data breach

dear account holder:

the chronicle of higher education, inc. takes data security very seriously and we understand the importance of protecting the information we maintain. we are writing to inform you about an incident that may have involved some of your information. this notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened:

on may 10, 2020, the chronicle concluded our investigation and analysis of a data security incident that involved unauthorized access to one of our servers. the chronicle learned about the incident after receiving an internal alert about suspicious activity on the server. upon learning of this, the chronicle took the server offline, a leading cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with the investigation, and law enforcement was notified. through our investigation, the chronicle determined that unauthorized parties exploited a vulnerability in the server, through which they were able to obtain administrative account credentials for the server. the unauthorized parties then logged in to the server on february 17, 2020, and accessed a database on the server that contained credentials for online accounts to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and chroniclevitae.com.

what information was involved:

our investigation determined that the server accessed by the unauthorized parties contained a database with your username(s) and hashed and salted password(s) for your online account(s) to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and/or chroniclevitae.com. the password(s) for your account(s) were not in plain text but had been altered through a cryptographic hashing and salting process, which rendered the actual password(s) indecipherable to third parties. although access to the hashed and salted passwords would not allow access to your account(s), we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution because our investigation was unable to rule out the possibility that unauthorized parties could bypass the cryptographic hashing and salting process.

what you can do:

the next time you log in to your online account(s), you will be prompted to change your password(s). also, if you use the same username(s) and password(s) for any other online account, we recommend that you change your password there as well.

what we are doing:

to date, we have no evidence that there has been any unauthorized access to your online account(s), however, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. in addition to resetting the password(s) to your online accounts using stronger hashing and salting technology, we have taken steps to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, including the replacement of the server with the unauthorized access, as well as additional procedures to further expand and strengthen security processes.

for more information:

we regret any inconvenience or concern this may cause you. if you have any questions, please contact 1-833-579-1097, monday-friday, 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., eastern daylight time.

upon learning of the incident, we immediately directed our third-party vendor to remove all current and former pcl employee data from its database. the third-party vendor also began an investigation and engaged a cybersecurity and forensic firm to determine how the security incident occurred and the scope of such incident. additionally, pcl hired a leading forensic investigation firm to conduct a search of the dark web in relation to the incident, which advised that it found no evidence of misuse of pcl employees' personal information.

what information was involved

dear claimant,

we are writing to inform you that the department of labor has discovered that your name and social security number may have been mistakenly sent to an employer who is not associated with your unemployment claim. this was due to a processing error and not a result of any external breach of dol data.

we have contacted all employers who received this wrong information and instructed them to destroy any ssns they received in error. we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

we want to assure you that there is no evidence of any misuse of your information at this time. however, we recommend that you closely monitor your accounts for any suspicious activity. to help you protect yourself against the risk of identity theft, we have included a checklist of suggestions with this letter.

the mailing that contained the wrongful printing of claimant names and ssns on the backside of forms requesting information about wages paid occurred on approximately march 30, 2020. these forms were mailed by dol to employers regarding employees who have submitted a claim for unemployment insurance benefits. corrected forms were resent to all employers.

if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us. thank you for your attention to this matter.

sincerely,

cameron wood
unemployment insurance director

tips for guarding against identity theft

(1) review your bank, credit card, and debit card account statements over the next twelve to twenty-four months and immediately report any suspicious activity to your bank or credit union.

(2) monitor your credit reports with the major credit reporting agencies:
equifax: 1-800-685-1111, www.equifax.com
experian: 1-888-397-3742, www.experian.com
transunion: 1-800-916-8800, www.transunion.com

under vermont law, you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report from those agencies every twelve months. call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report if you find:
(a) accounts you did not open;
(b) inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate; or
(c) inaccurate personal information, such as home address and social security number.

(3) if you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or other account statements, call your local police or sheriff's office and file a report of identity theft. get a copy of the police report. you may need to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up your records, and also to access some services that are free to identity theft victims.

(4) if you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or on your other account statements, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit files so creditors will contact you before opening new accounts. call any one of the three credit reporting agencies at the number below to place fraud alerts with all of the agencies:
equifax: 888-766-08
experian: 888-397-3742
transunion: 800-680-7289

(5) you may also get information about security freezes using the below addresses:
equifax: https://www.freeze.equifax.com/freeze/jsp/sff_personalidinfo.jsp
experian: http://www.experian.com/consumer/security_freeze.html
transunion: https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze

if you do not have internet access but would like to learn more about how to place a security freeze, contact the vt attorney general's office at 802-656-3183 (800-649-2424 toll-free in vermont only).

(6) even if you do not find suspicious activity on your credit report or your other account statements, it is important that you check your credit report for the next two years. just call one of the numbers in paragraph 2 above to order your reports or to keep a fraud alert in place.

helpful information about identity theft, security freezes, and obtaining a free copy of your credit report is available on the vt attorney general's website: http://ago.vermont.gov/. another helpful source is the federal trade commission website: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft.	the letter states that the information of the recipient was mistakenly sent to an employer due to a processing error and not a result of any external breach of dol data. therefore, this appears to be an unintended disclosure not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss.

over the last several weeks, our company has worked closely with the u.s. treasury and small business administration (sba) to process more than 305,000 paycheck protection program (ppp) loan applications with the sba, providing more than $25 billion in financial relief for small businesses in need. we are writing to advise you that in preparation for submission of loan applications to the sba, bank of america (the bank) uploaded some clients' loan applications to a limited access, controlled sba test application platform. this platform was designed to allow authorized lenders to test the process for submitting ppp applications to the sba prior to the actual submission process.

during testing, we discovered information included in your application may have been visible for a limited time period to a limited number of other lenders and their vendors authorized by the sba to participate in the program. there is no indication that your information was viewed or misused by these lenders or their vendors. and your information was not visible to other business clients applying for loans, or to the public, at any time. this did not affect the actual submission of ppp loan applications to the sba.

what information was involved:

the information that may have been briefly visible to limited authorized lenders and their vendors included business contact and business information about the company of which you are a principal owner, such as business address and tax identification number (tin). as a principal owner, personal information about you, such as your name, address, social security number, phone number, email address and citizenship may have been involved.

notice of data breach

what happened?
the student information system of kingsburg elementary charter school district had unauthorized access involving parent and student data. on tuesday may 12, 2020, the district it department was notified that several school districts in the surrounding area had recently determined that their sis (student information system) databases were compromised in november of 2019 through a vulnerability in the aeries sis software. upon receiving this information, our it department immediately ran security checks, reviewed logs and was able to confirm that kingsburg elementary charter school districts student information system database was accessed without authorization in november of 2019. aeries, who licenses our use of the software, notified customers of the following: in late november 2019, aeries software became aware of unauthorized attempts to access data through the aeries sis hosted platform. in response, aeries immediately began an investigation into whether these attempts had been successful and, if so, how they had been accomplished, what impact, if any, they may have had on data, and what steps they could take to thwart future unauthorized access to data through the aeries sis using the same or similar means. at the time, internal investigation did not reveal any compromise of the aeries sis or data. nevertheless, aeries software deployed a series of security patches in the december 20, 2019 version of the aeries sis which addressed the results of their internal investigation. then, in late january 2020, aeries was informed by a locally hosted district that their database may have been previously subject to unauthorized access, they had informed local authorities, and a criminal investigation was underway. aeries now understands that the investigation by the authorities is ongoing and they are working closely with local law enforcement and federal authorities as well as the original reporting district to determine what transpired, by whom it was perpetrated, and what impact, if any, it may have had on data. in working with the original reporting district and law enforcement officials, in march 2020 aeries was able to expand their earlier investigation with the new information as to the methods used by the individuals who had accessed data without authorization.

what information was involved?
student and parent internal id number, first name, last name, parent/guardian name, residence address, resident city, parent/guardian email address and password.

what we are doing.
while there is no evidence to suggest that your data was misused, state law mandates that we notify our families of whose data may have been subject to unauthorized access. (see cal. civ. code 1798.29; see also cal. gov. code 6252.) we are instituting a mandatory password reset for all parent and student accounts out of an abundance of caution. instructions for completing the password reset will be sent to the email address on record for every impacted account. the vulnerability that allowed the data to be exploited was a bug in the aeries student information system software and was patched in december 2019. we are working with aeries, and law enforcement where appropriate. aeries software has indicated the perpetrators have been taken into custody and the unauthorized access has been terminated.

what you can do.
we strongly advise all impacted users to follow the instructions being sent out via email to change their aeries passwords immediately. if you have used your aeries password for any other online accounts, we strongly advise you to change those passwords as well and avoid using duplicated passwords. there is nothing to suggest that any data was accessed revealing social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. nevertheless, if you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the ftcs site at identitytheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. your complaint will be added to the ftcs consumer sentinel network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations.

contents of data breach notification letter: organization: santa barbara unified school district
date: may 20, 2020
subject: notice of data breach

what happened?
in november 2019, aeries software discovered unauthorized attempts to access the aeries student information system and began investigating. aeries is the largest student information system vendor in california and is used by districts across the state. at that time, aeries did not identify any data compromise. in december 2019, aeries released security patches as a precautionary measure to address potential vulnerabilities. while investigating the unauthorized access attempt further, aeries discovered that some data was accessed. on april 27, 2020, aeries notified districts of the security breach and indicated that only districts using aeries hosted services were compromised. sbunified does not use aeries hosted services and was not impacted. on may 6, 2020, aeries notified all districts who store their aeries data on their servers that they might have been impacted and offered assistance in determining whether those districts were compromised. on may 18, 2020, aeries completed its investigation of sbunified's database and notified the district that it may have been impacted by the same breach. sbunified conducted an internal review of aeries' findings and determined that it was one of hundreds of aeries districts that were potentially compromised. aeries received notice that the perpetrators have been taken into custody and that the unauthorized access has been terminated.

what information was involved?
aeries' investigation determined that student id numbers, parent and student emails, physical addresses, and hashed passwords may have been subject to unauthorized access. a "hashed password" is encrypted, meaning that the actual password cannot be viewed.

what we are doing?
while there is no evidence to suggest that the data was misused, state law requires that we notify our families whose data may have been subject to unauthorized access. out of an abundance of caution, we are requiring that all parents/guardians with aeries accounts reset their aeries passwords. students use their district google accounts to access aeries, and their google passwords would not have been at risk as part of this breach. additionally, we have protections in place to ensure that people outside of our district cannot email our students directly. aeries fixed the vulnerability that permitted the unauthorized access in december 2019.

what you can do?
parents/guardians should go to https://aeries.sbunified.org/parent and log in, and the system will walk you through resetting your password. if you have used the same password that you use for aeries on any other websites, we recommend that you change your password on those other websites. we also recommend that you avoid using the same password on multiple websites in the future.

for more information.
call our technology helpline at (805) 696-2700 or email us at support@sbunified.org.	the breach appears to have resulted from an unauthorized attempt to access the aeries student information system by hackers. although santa barbara unified school district did not use aeries hosted services, aeries notified the school district that it may have been impacted by the same breach. student id numbers, parent and student emails, physical addresses, and hashed passwords may have been subject to unauthorized access.

notice of data breach

dear hosted customer:

we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have affected the aeries student information system.

what happened?

we want to inform you that your database may have been subject to unauthorized access involving your parent and student data. in late november 2019, aeries software became aware of unauthorized attempts to access data through the aeries sis. we immediately began an investigation into whether these attempts had been successful and, if so, how they had been accomplished, what impact, if any, they may have had on data, and what steps we could take to thwart future unauthorized access to data through the aeries sis using the same or similar means. at the time, internal investigation did not reveal any compromise of the aeries sis or data. nevertheless, aeries software deployed a series of security patches in the december 20, 2019 version of the aeries sis which addressed the results of our internal investigation.

then, in late january 2020, we were informed by a locally hosted district that their database may have been previously subject to unauthorized access, they had informed local authorities, and a criminal investigation was underway. we now understand that the investigation by the authorities is ongoing and we are working closely with local law enforcement and federal authorities as well as the district to determine what transpired, by whom it was perpetrated, and what impact, if any, it may have had on data. in working with the district and law enforcement officials, in march 2020 we were able to expand our earlier investigation with the new information as to the methods used by the individuals who had accessed data without authorization. specifically, we determined that the unauthorized access had included parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, emails, and password hashes. with access to a password hash, weak, common or simple passwords, can be deconstructed to gain unauthorized access to parent and student accounts. according to the results of our investigation, there is evidence to suggest that your database in our hosted environment may have been subject to unauthorized access by this means. however, we understand the perpetrators have been taken into custody and the unauthorized access has been terminated.

what information was involved?

at the moment, our investigation has revealed parent and student login information, physical addresses, emails, and passwords hashes have been subject to unauthorized access.

what we are doing

while there is no evidence to suggest that your data was misused, aeries software policy requires that we notify our customers whose data may have been subject to unauthorized access. out of an abundance of caution, we strongly recommend that you reset the account passwords for your parents and students as soon as possible. to assist our customers with password security, in the march 26th version of aeries, a new feature was released to provide system administrators the ability to run a process that resets the passwords for parents and/or students in the pwa table and sends an email that includes a link for that account to reset their password. we strongly recommend ensuring all passwords meet parameters which reflect industry security best practices, such as:

- force users to change passwords every 6 months (minimum)
- days prior to expiration to notify users - 10 days (minimum)
- minimum length: 8-16 characters
- require a special character
- require letters and numbers
- require upper and lower case

aeries documentation can be found here: aeries password requirements

it is also important to understand that upon being made aware of these vulnerabilities, we took immediate action to ensure that critical patches were deployed to ensure that the vulnerabilities were no longer a threat to the system. in addition, we have taken additional technical measures to prevent future incidents and we are adopting new security protocols to increase protection of all customer data. in addition to allocating several resources to perform a rigorous internal security audit, we will also be engaging an independent third party to assist us in conducting a complete audit and analysis of our system security.

what you can do

while our password guidelines are optional, we strongly recommend ensuring all passwords meet parameters which reflect industry security best practices, such as:

- force users to change passwords every 6 months (minimum)
- days prior to expiration to notify users - 10 days (minimum)
- minimum length: 8-16 characters
- require a special character
- require letters and numbers
- require upper and lower case

for more information on password settings, the documentation can be found here: aeries password requirements. documentation for the new reset parent/student accounts can be found here: reset parent/student account passwords.

there is nothing to suggest that any data was accessed revealing social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. nevertheless, if you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the ftcs site at identitytheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. your complaint will be added to the ftcs consumer sentinel network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations. in addition, you can contact all three major credit bureaus to request that your credit reports be sent to you, free of charge, for your review. even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the federal trade commission (ftc) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. thieves may hold stolen information to use at different times. checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

for more information

we will continue to follow-up with any additional recommendations, details, or bulletins that you should be made aware of as more information comes in. for more information, please email legal@aeries.com.	aeries software became aware of unauthorized attempts to access data through the aeries sis and was later informed that a locally hosted district's database may have also been subject to unauthorized access. the investigation revealed unauthorized access that included parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, emails, and password hashes. there is evidence to suggest that databases in the hosted environment may have been subject to unauthorized access, although the extent of the breach is uncertain.

re: notice of security incident

dear [name],

i am writing on behalf of weaver fundraising, llc d/b/a trails end (trails end) to inform you of an incident that involved your personal information. this letter provides you with information about the steps trails end has taken to guard against future misappropriation or misuse of your personal data.

what happened?

it appears that an unauthorized party obtained your username from sources other than trails end (i.e. the dark web or previously compromised accounts), used it to attempt to access your account, and clicked the forgot password button. when we sent a new password to your email address, the unauthorized party was able to pull the new password from network traffic.

with a username and new password, the unauthorized party could enter an account, change information like your username, email address, password, and redeem an amazon.com gift card (gift card). it appears an unauthorized party began pulling passwords from network traffic on may 3, 2020, and we discovered this was occurring on may 7, 2020, and immediately began an investigation to block the attacker.

what information was involved?

based on our investigation, we believe the unauthorized party gained access to your username and a password needed to access your trails end account. we believe the unauthorized party also claimed a gift card in your account and changed your email address so that the gift card was not sent to you. we have since provided another gift card for you to claim in your account, and we reset your username and email address back to what it was prior to the attack by the unauthorized party. our investigation indicates that the unauthorized party did not compromise other information.

what we are doing

once we realized what was occurring, we immediately started an investigation, blocked the attacker, updated our security features, and reset information in your account back to what it originally was prior to the attack. although we have reset your information, we recommend that you go into your account and change your password since it is currently a random password we assigned to you to prevent the attacker from accessing your account. you also can contact us to update your username if you desire. although we intend to report this incident to the appropriate law enforcement officials, the mailing of this notice was not delayed by law enforcement.

what you can do

please promptly change your password. additionally, although we don't believe any of your sensitive information was taken, our required legal notice enclosed called preventing identity theft and fraud provides more information on ways to protect against the potential misuse of your information.

for more information

again, we take the security of your information very seriously, and we will continue to monitor and take measures to protect your information. if you have additional questions, please email us at support@trails-end.com.

sincerely,

trails end popcorn company

preventing identity theft and fraud

as a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. you should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the federal trade commission (ftc). you may wish to review the tips provided by the ftc on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft. for more information and to contact the ftc, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-id-theft (1-877-438-4338). you may also contact the ftc at: federal trade commission, 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20580.

fraud alerts:

you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

credit and security freezes:

you may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies using the contact information above.

re: incident notification

dear sir or madam:

we are writing on behalf of our client, car wash partners, inc., dba mister car wash, to provide notice of a security incident. on april 28, 2020, car wash partners determined that an email security incident may have resulted in unauthorized access to personal information of 1,480 iowa residents, including names, social security numbers and drivers license numbers. upon learning of the incident, car wash partners immediately took steps to secure the email accounts, launched an investigation, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist.

the investigation determined that an unauthorized individual accessed the email accounts at various times between october 30, 2019 and january 14, 2020. the investigation was not able to determine which emails and attachments, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized person. therefore, car wash partners conducted a thorough review of the contents of the email accounts and determined that an email or an attachment to an email in the accounts contained the personal information of 1,480 iowa residents.

today, car wash partners is sending notification letters via first class mail to 1,480 iowa residents whose personal information was contained in the accessed email accounts. this notice is being provided in accordance with iowa code 715c.1-2. enclosed is a sample copy of the letter.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear valued member of our minted community,

we are writing to notify you of a data security incident involving your personal information. we describe below what happened, what information was involved, and what minted is doing to address this matter. we also outline what steps you can take in response, including promptly changing your password to your minted account. we are taking this matter very seriously and sincerely regret any concern it may cause you.

what happened:

we recently became aware of a report that mentioned minted as one of ten companies impacted by a potential cybersecurity incident. we promptly undertook an investigation, with the assistance of outside forensic experts. the investigation determined that, on may 6, 2020, unauthorized actors obtained information from our user account database. since determining this on may 15, we have been continuing to investigate as expeditiously as possible to assess what information was impacted and to identify and notify affected users.

what information was involved:

the information obtained included:

- your name
- your login credentials to your minted account, consisting of your email address and password. your password was not in plaintext but was in a coded format generated through a cryptographic process known as hashing and salting, which is designed to make your password unreadable.
- if you provided the following information to minted, your telephone number, billing address, and shipping address(es)

what information was not involved:

based on our investigation to date, we have no reason to believe that the following information was affected:

- your payment or credit card information
- your address book information
- your photos or personalized information that you added to minted designs

what we are doing:

we are continuing to investigate this incident diligently, with the ongoing assistance of outside experts. we also promptly notified u.s. federal law enforcement authorities and are closely cooperating with their investigation. in addition, we are reviewing our security protocols and have taken steps to enhance security.

what you can do:

your password was hashed and salted and not stored in plaintext. in an abundance of caution, however, please change your password at your earliest convenience. to change your password:

1. go to your minted account page at https://www.minted.com/myaccount
2. click change password
3. enter your current and new passwords
4. click change password.

if you forgot your password, you can reset it here: https://www.minted.com/forgot. you should choose a strong password that is not easy to guess. as an additional precaution, you should change your password for any other online accounts for which you use the same email address and password combination.

as always, please be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask you to provide your personal information electronically and avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails. minted will never ask you for your financial information via email or phone. it is a good practice to monitor your accounts and any credit reports you receive for any signs of suspicious activity.

other guidance, including how to obtain a free credit report, is provided in the attached additional resources, which we encourage you to review.

re: aeries parent portal

estimado padre/guardián de estudiante de iusd:

el distrito escolar unificado de inglewood (el "distrito") se compromete a proteger la confidencialidad y seguridad de la información de nuestros estudiantes y la de sus padres. estamos escribiendo para informarles acerca de un incidente reciente que involucró sus datos. este aviso explica el incidente, las medidas que se han tomado y algunos pasos que puede tomar en respuesta.

¿qué pasó?

el distrito utiliza el sistema de información de estudiantes aeries para proporcionar a los estudiantes y a sus padres acceso en línea a información sobre eventos y horarios escolares. a fines de noviembre del 2019, aeries se enteró de que una persona no autorizada explotó una vulnerabilidad en el software aeries que permitiría el acceso a la información de los padres y estudiantes. tras el descubrimiento, aeries comenzó una investigación y la policía inició una investigación para identificar a la persona responsable, que aeries cree que ahora está bajo custodia policial. el 27 de abril del 2020, aeries notificó al distrito que esta persona pudo haber accedido al sistema aeries del distrito.

¿qué información estuvo involucrada?

la información a la que accedió el perpetrador incluía potencialmente el nombre del padre y/o estudiante, la dirección de su casa, el número de teléfono, la dirección de correo electrónico y la contraseña con hash, una forma de hacer que la contraseña real sea indescifrable para terceros, para el sistema aeries.

lo que puede hacer

a pesar de que no tenemos evidencia de que su información personal haya sido mal utilizada, deseamos informarle que esto sucedió y asegurarnos de que lo tomemos muy en serio. aunque no se accedió a la contraseña en sí, es posible que una persona con suficiente tiempo y habilidad pueda descifrar la contraseña. por lo tanto, por precaución, se le pedirá que cambie su contraseña la próxima vez que inicie sesión en su cuenta. además, si usa la misma contraseña para otras cuentas en línea, también recomendamos cambiar la contraseña de esas cuentas.

¿qué estamos haciendo?

entendemos la importancia de proteger la privacidad y la seguridad de la información personal, y lamentamos cualquier inconveniente o preocupación que pueda causar este incidente. para ayudar a evitar que algo como esto vuelva a suceder en el futuro, instalamos el parche de software que aeries puso a disposición para remediar la vulnerabilidad que permitía a personas no autorizadas acceder a nuestro sistema aeries. además, nosotros y aeries estamos revisando nuestros reglamentos y procedimientos existentes para mitigar cualquier riesgo asociado con este incidente y para prevenir mejor incidentes en el futuro.

para más información

nos disculpamos por cualquier inconveniente que esto pueda causarle. si tienes alguna pregunta, por favor llame (310) 680-5100 o (310) 680-5150 o mande un correo electrónico iusdtechnicalsupport@inglewoodusd.com.

sinceramente,

erika f. torres, ed.d., msw
county administrator	the sensitive information of students and their parents from the online student information system was accessed by an unauthorized person exploiting a vulnerability in the software. the perpetrator had access to the names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and hashed passwords of the parents and students.
contents of data breach notification letter: subject: notice of data breach

dear [recipient],

we are writing to inform you about a data breach incident that involved your information. laguna beach unified school district (lbusd) takes the confidentiality and security of our students' and their parents' information seriously, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause.

what happened?
lbusd uses the aeries student information system to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. in late november 2019, aeries discovered that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. upon discovery, aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who aeries believes is now in police custody. on may 6th, 2020, aeries confirmed to us that this individual may have accessed the other districts' aeries systems. we then conducted our own investigation and on may 14, 2020, determined that the individual did access parent and student data within the lbusd's aeries system.

it is our understanding that over 150 school districts in california have been impacted by this incident.

what information was involved?
the information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, email address, and hashed password, a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties for the aeries system.

what you can do
even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, you will be required to change your password on may 29th. to further secure your account, we will temporarily disable it if you do not sign in to change your password within 14 days of this notice. you would then need to contact helpdesk@lbusd.org to reset your account. additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well. after the school year closes, we will change the password to all student accounts.

what we are doing
we understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we are taking steps to prevent unauthorized access to the accounts involved. we are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our aeries system. in addition, we and aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

for more information
we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. if you have any questions, please email helpdesk@lbusd.org.

sincerely,
jason viloria

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

credit bureaus

p.o. box 2000
chester, pa 19022-2000

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year.

please note: no one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. security freeze	the organization was victim of a ransomware attack that was discovered on march 30, 2020. despite trying to recover the data from their backups, they couldn't and they ended up paying the attacker and recovering all of their data.

dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

i am writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by good samaritan hospital (good sam) that may have involved your personal information and/or protected health information, described below. at good sam, we take the privacy and security of all information very seriously. while we have no evidence to suggest that any of the impacted information was viewed or misused during this compromise, it is crucial that we be as supportive and transparent as possible. that is why i am writing to inform you of this incident, to offer information about steps that can be taken to help protect your information, and to let you know about complimentary credit monitoring services that we are offering you through kroll, a global leader in risk mitigation and response. i sincerely apologize for any concern that this incident may cause you. let me reassure you that good sam is dedicated to providing the best care possible, and fully committed to supporting you.

what happened: on november 4, 2019, good sam became aware of a potential compromise to several of its email accounts as a result of a targeted email phishing campaign that occurred over several days. during the course of this phishing campaign, good sam employees began receiving fraudulent emails that appeared to be from a known contact. these fraudulent emails contained a link to a malicious website that was designed to steal email account credentials. upon discovery, good sam swiftly blocked access to the malicious website. additionally, good sam immediately took steps to secure the affected accounts, which included resetting the passwords required to access the affected employee email accounts and implementing additional email and network security measures. further, good sam promptly began investigating the incident with the support of a third-party expert forensics firm. following progress by experts in their thorough investigation, it was ultimately determined that several employee email accounts experienced unauthorized access between october 28, 2019 and november 8, 2019 as a result of the above-referenced phishing campaign. upon confirmation of the unauthorized access to good sam employee email accounts, good sam's third-party forensic experts immediately investigated whether the affected email accounts contained individuals' sensitive information. on may 12, 2020, after continued thorough investigation, good sam learned that the unauthorized access may have enabled access to your personal information. the information potentially impacted was within the affected employee email accounts in the normal course and scope of business as a part of regular hospital operations. there is no evidence to suggest that any good sam employee acted maliciously. good sam has worked diligently to obtain sufficient contact information to provide affected individuals with this notification.

while we have no reason to believe that any information within the affected email accounts was actually viewed or misused during this compromise, we are providing this notification to you out of an abundance of caution and so that you may diligently monitor your personal information and resources. we take great care in the security of our technology systems, and regret that this incident has occurred. this incident did not involve good sam information systems and is limited to the affected email accounts.

based on the investigation conducted by good sam's third-party forensic experts, we believe the goal of the unauthorized individual(s) was to utilize the affected email accounts to redirect employee direct deposit payments rather than obtaining patient information.

what information was involved: it is important to note, as mentioned above, that there is no evidence to suggest that any personally identifiable information or personal health information has been viewed or misused. the personal information that could have been viewed by the unauthorized individual(s) may have included your first and last name, in combination with your date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, tax identification number, financial account number, treatment/diagnosis, health insurance information, billing information, doctor's name, medical record number, medical history, prescription information, medicare/medicaid id and/or patient account number.

what we are doing: good sam has taken every step necessary to address the incident and is committed to fully protecting all of the information that you have entrusted to us. unfortunately, phishing events have become more common and the phishing campaign experienced by good sam is similar to others experienced by other companies and industries. upon learning of this incident, we immediately secured the affected accounts and took steps to enhance the security of all information, including patient information,	good samaritan hospital experienced a phishing campaign which resulted in unauthorized access to several employee email accounts between october 28, 2019 and november 8, 2019. the personal information potentially impacted included first and last name, in combination with date of birth, ssn, driver's license number, passport number, tax identification number, financial account number, treatment/diagnosis, health insurance information, billing information, doctor's name, medical record number, medical history, prescription information, medicare/medicaid id and/or patient account number. no evidence was found that any information was actually viewed or misused, but the hospital is offering credit monitoring services through kroll to affected individuals as a precaution.

notice of unauthorized systems access

dear employee_first_name:

we value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know about a data security incident that may involve your personal information.

what happened?

on january 17, 2020, at approximately 10:33 am, peterson & smith equine hospital, llc (peterson & smith) it appears that there was an unauthorized access of peterson & smith's computer systems. peterson & smith's it team became aware of a potential issue approximately thirty minutes later. upon discovering the unauthorized access, peterson & smith acted quickly to minimize any potential risk by removing the associated technology from the system and commencing a thorough review.

a review of peterson & smith's systems, conducted by a forensic investigator hired by peterson & smith, revealed that the attack was malware named ryuk. the forensic investigation revealed that ryuk was active on the q drive, where some personal information on peterson & smith's employees is kept. there is no confirmation, or even any evidence, that any personal information was accessed. however, because the ryuk malware is capable of copying information from files, it is possible that personal information of peterson & smith's employees was accessed. it appears that this attack was directed at peterson & smith itself and not to capture customer information.

march 25, 2020

dear <affected individuals name>,

notice of data breach

fabfitfun values your membership in our community and respects the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to let you know about a recent data security incident that involves your personal information.

what happened?

our technical team recently discovered that a third party had illegally placed malicious code on the https://fabfitfun.com/shop/ extension of our website. our analysis has determined that the code was placed on the shop portion of the site on may 2nd, and it was discovered shortly thereafter on may 6th as part of a routine review of our site. shop was not highly trafficked at this time and the code did not impact other, more frequented portions of our website such as add-ons and box purchases. although only a very limited number of members were impacted, we have since been able to determine that you were likely one such member.

what information was involved?

if you completed a purchase on the shop site between may 2nd and may 6th of this year, we have reason to believe that your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, email address, credit card number, cvv code, and card expiration date were exposed. although we are not aware of any specific misuse of your information, we strongly urge you to take the steps detailed below. if you were in the process of checking out but did not complete a purchase during this window, we have reason to believe that your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address were exposed. we do not believe your credit card number, cvv code, and card expiration date were exposed, however, we are unable to confirm this with certainty. we are sending you this letter in an abundance of caution and we still urge you to take the steps detailed below.

what we are doing

we took immediate steps to mitigate this incident by removing the malicious code from our site. we also activated our incident response plan, conducted an internal investigation, and retained advisors to assist in the investigation and response. as with any incident of this nature, we are also of course reviewing our information security policies and practices to determine what, if anything, we can do to further guard against this type of intrusion and to improve site security. we are deeply appreciative that you have chosen to be a part of the fabfitfun community and we are determined to make sure that you are happy with that decision. we are providing you with a complimentary one-year annual membership as a token of our appreciation for your business. at the end of your current membership, we will add four pre-paid boxes to your account and give you select perks during that same time period. once you have received the four pre-paid boxes, your original subscription will continue unless and until you decide otherwise.

what you can do

we urge you to immediately contact your bank that issued your credit card (the relevant phone number should be printed on the back of your card) and follow their recommendations. you should also closely monitor your credit card account statements for suspicious activity. if you see discrepancies or unusual activity, immediately call your bank. under federal law and card company rules, customers who notify their payment card company in a timely manner upon discovering fraudulent charges will not be responsible for those charges. you may report any fraudulent charges to your local police or sheriffs office in order to file a police report for identity theft and to obtain a copy of the report. you may need to provide copies of the police report to creditors in order to clear any fraudulent charges from your records. you can also take additional actions described on the attachment to this letter.

for more information

if you have any questions, please contact our customer service team at 855-313-6267 or email privacy@fabfitfun.com for more information. we offer you our sincere apologies that this incident occurred.

re: notice of data breach

dear name,

we are writing to notify you of an incident that may affect the privacy of some of your information. while to date we have no evidence to suggest that information potentially affected by this incident has been misused, we take this incident very seriously and are providing you with details of the incident and the resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it is appropriate to do so.

what happened?

on april 28, 2020, allergy & asthma medical group of the bay area discovered that its berkeley physicians' office was broken into during the evening of april 27, 2020. we immediately initiated an investigation during which we learned that three laptops were stolen. while these laptops were secured, we are taking a conservative approach that the bad actor(s) may have gained access to them. accordingly, we performed a diligent review to determine what information was present on the laptops and to whom that information related.

based on that review, we learned that certain limited information relating to your feno results was potentially viewable on the laptop.

what information was involved?

your name, date of birth, allergy & asthma medical group id number, physician name, and feno test results that included a graph of such results.

our review confirmed that the bad actor(s) did not have access to your financial information, such as a social security number, credit card number, insurance information, or medical records. the only information that may have been accessible on the laptops is that described above involving your feno results.

what are we doing?

contents of data breach notification letter: subject: aeries data security incident may 12, 2020

dear rocklin unified school district families,

we are writing to inform you about a data security breach that occurred on aeries, the district's student information system (sis). aeries stores and provides access to certain student and parent information for rocklin unified school district. we are one of hundreds of districts using aeries sis that was affected by this breach. rusd has been a customer of aeries for over 20 years, and in that time has had no unauthorized access or data breaches with this software. we do not believe there is any reason to be alarmed or unduly concerned, but we wanted you to be informed about what happened.

timeline with information provided to us from aeries:

on april 27, 2020, we were informed that there may have been unauthorized access to the aeries sis on november 4th, 2019. the initial report was focused on aeries hosted databases, which we do not use. our student information system is housed on our own servers here in rocklin. on may 6, 2020, we learned that it may have also affected on-premise databases similar to ours. following directions provided by aeries, we immediately contacted aeries and got confirmation on may 11, 2020, that our data was also accessed.

this breach may have revealed parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and encrypted passwords. however, no other data elements were impacted as a result of this incident. social security numbers, credit card data, or other personal information is not kept in our aeries database. with access to encrypted passwords, unauthorized people may be able to deconstruct weak, common or simple passwords and subsequently enable unauthorized access to parent and student accounts and data stored in the aeries sis.

we have been informed that local and federal law enforcement officials were notified of the incident, charges were filed, and the people responsible were arrested. the investigation of their misconduct is continuing. while there is no evidence to suggest that your specific data was misused, out of an abundance of caution, we will reset the account passwords for all parents and students beginning tuesday, may 12, 2020. to reset your password, please follow the forgot password link on the aeries parent/student portal.

further, we will be enforcing stricter password security guidelines as an added precaution against the possibility of future such incidents. all new passwords will employ the following guidelines:

- force users to change passwords every 6 months (minimum)
- days prior to expiration to notify users - 10 days (minimum)
- minimum length: 8-16 characters
- require a special character
- require letters and numbers
- require upper and lower case

we have no reason to believe that any data was accessed revealing sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. rocklin unified school district does not keep this type of information associated with your aeries account. nevertheless, if you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the federal trade commission's site at identitytheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. your complaint will be added to the ftc's consumer sentinel network, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

for links and more information, go to www.rocklinusd.org/databreach. here you will also see what actions aeries is taking to prevent this from happening to our school district and others in the future. if you have any questions, including how to reset your password, please email safedata@rocklinusd.org, and one of our rusd technology services experts will respond and help you in a timely manner.

thank you,

rocklin unified school district	the breach occurred due to unauthorized access to the aeries student information system, which was hosted on the school district's own servers, by an unknown outside party on november 4th, 2019. parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and encrypted passwords were potentially accessed. although law enforcement officials were notified and charges were filed against the perpetrators, it is unknown whether the accessed information was misused.

dear parent or guardian of sbcusd student:

san bernardino city unified school district (sbcusd) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents. we are writing to address a recent incident that involved your data. this notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened?

on april 27th, 2020, aeries software notified over 150 school districts, including sbcusd, that their system was breached. the district uses the aeries student information system to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. in late november 2019, aeries learned that an unauthorized individual exploited a vulnerability in the aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. upon discovery, aeries and law enforcement launched an investigation and believe they have the person responsible in custody.

what information was involved?

the information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties - for the aeries system.

what you can do

while aeries software has no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. although the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, sbcusd will be implementing a mandatory password policy for all parent and student portal accounts. additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

what we are doing

we understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. aeries has installed the necessary software patch to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our aeries system. in addition, sbcusd and aeries software are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents. to assure that all aeries portal users have a strong password, sbcusd will be implementing a mandatory password change policy. details and effective date of the mandatory password change policy will be sent to your associated email account.

we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. if you have any questions, please call (909) 386-2550 or email studentemailsupport@sbcusd.k12.ca.us

the information that could have been subject to unauthorized access includes names, addresses, and social security numbers.

notice to iowa residents

on or about june 4, 2020, interstates provided written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes six hundred eighty-three (683) iowa residents. written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon discovering the event, interstates moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident and notify potentially affected individuals. interstates is no longer utilizing the services of paperless pay and is seeking assurances that paperless pay is destroying any information of interstates employees from their systems. interstates is also providing access to credit monitoring services for one year, through kroll, to individuals whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident, at no cost to these individuals.

additionally, interstates is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. interstates is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, information on protecting against tax fraud, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

fraud alerts: you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

credit and security freezes: you may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified above to find out more information:

dear bousd parents,

we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that affected the aeries student information system (sis), which stores and provides access to certain student and parent information for brea olinda unified school district. while we do not believe there is any reason to be alarmed or unduly concerned, we wanted to inform you about what happened.

in late april, we were informed that there may have been unauthorized access to the aeries sis, which may have revealed parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and a form of password known as a password hash. however, no other data elements were impacted as a result of this incident. the incident was not isolated to only the brea olinda unified school district, but many districts throughout the state. aeries also shared with their customers that in addition to an ongoing investigation, arrests have been made, and law enforcement has filed charges against the alleged perpetrators.

while there is no evidence to suggest that your specific data was misused, out of an abundance of caution, we will send you an email with a link to change your aeries parent portal password on monday, june 8, 2020. student password information to the aeries parent portal was not impacted as their access is tied to their google account, and not stored in aeries.

we consider it important for you to understand that upon being made aware of this incident, aeries software took immediate action to ensure the security of the system and has taken additional measures to prevent future incidents, including, but not limited to, engaging an independent third party to assist in conducting a complete audit and analysis of their system security.

if you have any questions, please send an email to aerieshelp@bousd.us.

changing your aeries parent portal password

on june 8th, 2020, we will send you an aeries password reset email containing a link to change your aeries parent portal password. a sample of this email is pictured below. once you have clicked on the link, it will take you to an aeries website that will ask you to change your password (pictured below).

if you have any questions, please send an email to aerieshelp@bousd.us.	the unauthorized access to the aeries student information system suggests that an outside party hacked into the system, revealing student and parent login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and password hashes.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear parents,

we are writing to inform you of a recent incident involving your data at fairfield-suisun unified school district (the district). our commitment to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents is unwavering. this notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened?

the district uses the aeries student information system to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. in late november 2019, aeries discovered that an unauthorized individual exploited a vulnerability in the aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. upon discovery, aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who aeries believes is now in police custody. on may 6, 2020, aeries notified us that this individual may have accessed the district's aeries system.

what information was involved?

the information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, and login information for the aeries system, consisting of email address and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties.

what you can do

even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, we will be implementing a mandatory password reset for all parent and student portal accounts. additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

what we are doing

we understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our aeries system. in addition, we are working with aeries to review our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

the district's student information system developer, aeries software, inc. (dba eagle software), was notified in late november 2019 of unauthorized attempts to access data through the aeries sis. in response, they immediately began an investigation into whether these attempts had been successful and, if so, how they had been accomplished, what impact on data, if any, and what steps they could take to thwart future unauthorized access to data through the aeries sis using the same or similar means. at the time, their investigation did not reveal any compromise of the aeries sis or data. nevertheless, aeries software deployed a series of security patches in the december 20, 2019 version of the aeries sis which addressed the findings of their internal investigation.

in working with the district and law enforcement officials, in march 2020 aeries software was able to expand their earlier investigation with the new information as to the methods used by the individuals who had accessed data without authorization. specifically, they determined that the unauthorized access had included parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, emails addresses, and password hashes. with access to a password hash, weak, common or simple passwords can be deconstructed to gain unauthorized access to parent and student accounts.

what information was involved?
parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, emails addresses, and password hashes. however, no other data elements were impacted as a result of this incident.

what we are doing
while there is no evidence to suggest that your data was misused, state law requires that we notify our families whose data may have been subject to unauthorized access. out of an abundance of caution, we have reset the portal account passwords. it is also important to understand that upon being made aware of these vulnerabilities, aeries software took immediate action to ensure that critical patches were deployed to ensure that the vulnerabilities were no longer a threat to the system. in addition, aeries software has taken additional technical measures to prevent future incidents, and they are adopting new security protocols to increase protection of all student data. aeries software will also be engaging an independent third party to assist them in conducting a complete audit and analysis of their system security.

what you can do
we have no reason to believe that any data was accessed revealing sensitive information that would directly impact your credit rating. if you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the ftc's site at identitytheft.gov. you can also contact all three major credit bureaus to request that your credit reports be sent to you, free of charge, for your review.

for more information
we will continue to follow-up with any additional recommendations, details, or bulletins that you should be made aware of as more information comes in. if you have any questions regarding this incident or if you desire further information or assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us at 530-824-8000.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear parent/guardian,

we at the san leandro unified school district (the district) are committed to ensuring the confidentiality and security of our students' and their parents' information. we are writing to inform you of a recent incident that involved your data. this notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened?

the district uses the aeries student information system to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. in late november 2019, aeries discovered that an unauthorized individual exploited a vulnerability in the aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. upon discovery, aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who aeries believes is now in police custody. on may 5, 2020, aeries notified the district that this individual may have accessed the district's aeries system.

what information was involved?

the information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties - for the aeries system.

what you can do

even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, you will be required to change your password the next time you sign into your account. additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

what we are doing

we understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. in order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our aeries system. in addition, we and aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

for more information

we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. if you have any questions, please call 510-667-6207 or email lsimon@slusd.us.

what you can do

in addition to signing up for the complimentary monitoring service, to protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. a fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. when a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. the alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. you can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any of the toll-free numbers of the credit reporting agencies provided below. you will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three credit bureaus.

you have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. the security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

to place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit file, contact each credit reporting agency directly:

transunion po box 1000 chester, pa 19016 1-800-680-7289 www.transunion.com

when you place any type of fraud alert on your credit file, the credit reporting agencies will send you a free copy of your credit report. look for accounts that are not yours, debts you do not owe, or any other inaccuracies (e.g., wrong social security number or home address). if you find an error, contact the credit reporting agency directly. by law, that credit reporting agency must investigate and respond.

re: notice of data breach

dear families,

we are writing to inform you about an incident potentially affecting some of your students' personal information. we value all our students and families and are providing this notice to outline some steps you may take to help protect yourself.

what happened

on june 2, 2020, kipp socal was notified of an issue involving unauthorized access to a data file containing certain students' information. the issue was found when a vendor that we contract with discovered that our github page containing the data file had an incorrect privacy setting, allowing our data file to be searchable within the confines of github from october 3, 2019, through june 2, 2020. the page may have been accessed seven times by individuals or robots during the time it was exposed. you are receiving this notice because we determined that your students' information was among those that were accessed without authorization.

what information was involved

the student information was stored on a data platform called github that kipp socal and many other public organizations use for data management. the page containing the data file included student names, addresses, birth dates, race/ethnicity, primary language, and primary disability. social security numbers were not included in the file. the issue has been resolved, and we do not have any evidence that the information has been misused.

what we are doing

after kipp socal learned of the issue, we immediately deleted the data file and inactivated the github page, conducted a full audit of github and other data platforms, and put additional layers of security into place for future protection. we take the safety and security of our students' information very seriously and reinforce our pledge to make our schools safe zones. we are in the process of conducting data security audits across all of our systems to ensure that this is an isolated incident and it does not happen again.

what you can do

we recommend you be on the alert for any suspicious activity related to your financial accounts and credit reports. despite no social security numbers or drivers' license or identification card numbers being part of this file, we encourage you to regularly monitor your statements and records to ensure there are no transactions or other activities that you did not initiate or authorize. if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. you also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the federal trade commission (ftc). you can review your credit information by contacting the three credit bureaus and have the option of placing a fraud alert on your accounts. the three credit bureaus' contact information is listed below:

the incident occurred through a flaw in the asa's customer relationship management software, called imis, which is produced by advanced solutions international (asi). the imis software contained a flaw that allowed personal information to be compromised.

contents of data breach notification letter: subject: aeries security breach

dear charter alternative program parents,

we are writing to inform you about a data security incident that affected the aeries student information system. this system stores and provides access to certain student and parent information for schools across the united states. although we do not believe there is any reason to be concerned, we wanted to inform you about what happened.

on may 6th, 2020, we received information that there may have been unauthorized access to the aeries sis on november 4th, 2019. this may have revealed parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and password hashes. although a password hash is an encrypted password (not visible), unauthorized persons may be able to deconstruct weak, common or simple passwords, which would enable the person to access unauthorized parent and student accounts and data stored in the aeries sis. based on the report we received from aeries, no other data stored in our aeries database was affected, including grades, credits, & transcripts.

we have been informed that local and federal law enforcement officials were notified of the incident, charges were filed on a single individual, and the investigation is continuing. while there is no evidence to suggest that data was misused, we will be resetting the account passwords for all charter parents out of an abundance of caution tomorrow, may 19th. as an added precaution against the possibility of future such incidents, we will be enforcing stricter password security guidelines, which will require the following:

- minimum length: 8 characters
- require a special character
- require letters and numbers
- require upper and lower case

upon being made aware of the incident, aeries software took action to ensure the security of the system and has taken additional technical measures to prevent future incidents, including adopting new security protocols. we will continue to work closely with aeries software to ensure that your data remains as secure as possible.

if you suspect your personal information has been misused, you can visit the ftc's site at identitytheft.gov to get further information. your complaint will be added to the ftc's consumer sentinel network, where it will be accessible to law enforcers for their investigations.

sincerely,

what information was involved?

what you can do:

we remind you to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your financial account statements for any suspicious activity. you should immediately report any suspicious activity to your financial institution. please see the pages that follow this notice for additional steps you may take.

sincerely,

<<b2b_text_3(signatoryinfo)>>

additional steps you can take

we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228. contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts:

there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes:

you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports?

there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.

for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com

transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com

equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze?

a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	the unauthorized party may have accessed some of the computer servers between april 14, 2020 and april 18, 2020, indicating a hack by an outside party.

what happened?

on may 5, 2020, we were informed that our server experienced an intrusion. the intruder or intruders placed malware on our server and by doing so, may have gained access to our customers' names, addresses, social security numbers, tax returns, and information used to file tax returns. we retained outside vendors to evaluate our system and corrective action was immediately implemented. the investigation is continuing and we are unable to affirmatively confirm which files, if any, were actually accessed. out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying those whose information was potentially accessed.

what information was involved?

the information may have included names, addresses, social security numbers, tax returns, and information used to file tax returns.

what we are doing

cyber-attacks continue to increase and evolve. for this reason, and to help prevent this type of incident in the future, we are actively enhancing our data security procedures. we have removed all malicious code on our system, enabled other cybersecurity layers of protection, and have implemented security upgrades to our system. we are currently in the process of communicating with all necessary consumer reporting and governmental agencies.

what you can do

1. change your passwords on any accounts that may have been breached and remember to use unique passwords across different accounts.

2. remain vigilant and monitor your credit and identity by reviewing your account statements and monitor credit reports for any unauthorized activity. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

3. initiate a fraud alert which will warn lenders that you may have been a fraud victim. when you request a fraud alert be added with any of the three major credit bureaus, the bureau you contacted will notify the other two and alerts will be added with those bureaus as well. this extra precaution will notify any potential lenders that they should contact you before granting any new line of credit in your name. this fraud alert will stay on your credit report for 90 days, and you can renew the fraud alert when it expires.

4. keep an eye on your financial accounts by visiting your online bank and financial accounts, and setting up any alert features they may have. this may keep you notified of any unusual activity, should it occur.

5. report any suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, or the federal trade commission.

6. place a security freeze. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed below in writing to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze.

in order to request a security freeze, you may need to provide all the following information:

1. your full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);

2. social security number;

3. date of birth;

notice of data breach

what happened

on april 22, 2020, our investigation determined that the email account contained some of your personal information. at this point, we do not believe that the unauthorized third party's motivation was to access the personal information contained in the email account and have no indication that any such information has been used for fraud or identity theft purposes. nonetheless, we are providing you with this notice because your personal information was contained in the relevant account. we are also committed to taking steps to help prevent something like this from happening again, including reviewing our technical controls and increased security training for all staff members.

fraud alerts: you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. a fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit report for one year. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

credit and security freezes: you may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information:

contents of data breach notification letter: subject: aeries data security incident - june 24, 2020

dear saddleback valley unified school district families,

we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that affected aeries, the district's student information system (sis). aeries sis stores and provides access to certain student and parent information for saddleback valley unified school district. we are one of the hundreds of districts using aeries sis that was affected by this incident. svusd has been a customer of aeries for over 10 years, and in that time has had no unauthorized access or data incidents with this software. we do not believe there is any reason to be alarmed or unduly concerned, but we wanted you to be informed about what happened.

timeline with the information provided to us from aeries:

on april 27, 2020, we were informed there may have been unauthorized access to the aeries sis on november 4th, 2019. the initial report was focused on aeries hosted databases, which we do not use. our student information system is housed on-premise on our own servers. on may 6, 2020, svusd learned that the aeries incident may have also impacted on-premise databases. following directions provided by aeries, we immediately contacted aeries and received confirmation that our data was also accessed.

this incident may have revealed parent and student login information, physical residence addresses, email addresses, and encrypted passwords. however, no other data elements were impacted because of this incident. social security numbers, credit card data, or other personal information is not kept in our aeries database. with access to encrypted passwords, unauthorized people may be able to deconstruct weak, common, or simple passwords and subsequently enable unauthorized access to parent and student accounts and data stored in the aeries sis.

we have been informed that local and federal law enforcement officials were notified of the incident, charges were filed, and the people responsible were arrested. the investigation of their misconduct is continuing. while there is no evidence to suggest that your specific data was misused, out of an abundance of caution, we will reset the account passwords for all parents beginning wednesday, june 24, 2020. to reset your password, please follow the forgot password link on the aeries parent/student portal. beginning thursday, june 25, 2020, both parents and students will be able to view the new student password in the family portal by navigating to student info > student data. students will begin using their new password monday, july 6, 2020.

further, we are encouraging stricter password security guidelines as an added precaution against the possibility of future such incidents. all new passwords should employ the following guidelines:

- recommend users to change passwords every 6 months (minimum)
- recommend minimum length: 8-16 characters
- recommend a special character
- require letters and numbers
- recommend upper and lower case letters

we have no reason to believe that any data was accessed revealing sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. saddleback valley unified school district does not ask nor keep this type of information associated with your aeries account. nevertheless, if you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the federal trade commission's site at identitytheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. your complaint will be added to the ftc's consumer sentinel network, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

for links and more information, go to https://click.svusd.org/svusd-cyber-security. here you will also see what actions aeries is taking to prevent this from happening to our school district and others in the future.

if you have any questions, including how to reset your password, please email portalsupport@svusd.org or call the help desk line at (949) 855-4357 monday through friday from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm, and one of our svusd technology services staff will respond and help you in a timely manner.

thank you,

saddleback valley unified school district	the breach was caused by unauthorized access to the aeries student information system that is on-premises on the school district's own servers. the incident was caused by a hacking incident where the perpetrators obtained encrypted passwords to the system.

subject: notice of data breach

dear parent,

adelanto elementary school district (the district) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents. we are writing to address a recent incident that involved your data. this notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened?
on april 27th, 2020, aeries software notified over 150 school districts, including aesd, that their system was breached. the district uses the aeries student information system to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. in late november 2019, aeries learned that an unauthorized individual exploited a vulnerability in the aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. upon discovery, aeries and law enforcement launched an investigation and believe they have the person responsible in custody.

what information was involved?
the information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password (form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties) for the aeries system.

what you can do?
even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, you will be required to change your password upon next login. additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

what we are doing
we understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. in order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our aeries system. in addition, we and aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

for more information
we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. if you have any questions, please call 1(760)5307693 between 8:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. pacific, email helpdesk@aesd.net, or visit https://www.aesd.net/aeriesbreach.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear parent of fn ln,

red bluff joint union high school district (the district) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents. we are writing to address a recent incident that may have involved your data. this notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened?

the district uses the aeries student information system to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. in late november 2019, aeries learned that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. upon discovery, aeries began an investigation and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who aeries believes is now in police custody. on may 3rd, 2020, we learned that this individual may have accessed the district's aeries system. we then conducted our investigation, and on may 6th, 2020, determined that the individual did access parent and student data in the district's aeries system.

what information was involved?

the information accessible to the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties for the aeries system. the following email accounts associated with your student were affected: accounts.

what you can do

even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, we recommend you change your password the next time you sign into your account. additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

what we are doing

we understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. in order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are recommending all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to potentially access our aeries system. in addition, we and aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

for more information

we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. if you have any questions, please call the district office at 530-529-8704, or email questions@rbhsd.org.

sincerely,

todd brose
superintendent	an unauthorized individual successfully exploited a vulnerability in the aeries student information system software, leading to access to parent and student data, including sensitive personally identifiable information such as names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and hashed passwords.

notice of data breach

dear [original first name] [original middle name] [original last name] [extra1]:

at salinas valley memorial healthcare system (svmhs), we understand that the confidentiality and security of your personal information is critically important, and we are committed to protecting it. this letter is to notify you of a recent cyber incident that affected svmhs and may have resulted in a compromise of certain electronic files containing your personal information.

what happened

on april 30, 2020, svmhs determined that the email account of one of its employees had been compromised. on may 7, 2020, and june 5, 2020, respectively, svmhs subsequently determined that email accounts of a contractor and three other employees were also compromised. these five email accounts were compromised through outlook web access, svmhs's browser-based email access solution.

based on our review of the emails within the compromised inboxes, we determined that an email containing your personal information was present in one of the inboxes. our investigation to date has suggested, however, that the unauthorized person(s) only had access to the inboxes for a matter of hours before we disabled access to the accounts. we also have no evidence at this time to suggest that the unauthorized person(s) viewed, retrieved or copied your personal information.

what information was involved

the personal information about you in the email in the affected inbox may have included identifying information, such as your name, hospital account number or medical record number, in combination with health information about you, such as your service location and your attending physician's information. the personal information about you in the email did not include your social security, driver's license or bank account numbers.

what we are doing

svmhs disabled access and then reset the passwords to the affected email accounts. further, we implemented additional security measures such as two-factor authentication to outlook web access for all svmhs email accounts. we have also taken other steps to try to prevent similar incidents in the future.

we note that this notification was not delayed as a result of any law enforcement investigation. we notified the california department of public health and are notifying the california attorney general and the u.s. department of health and human services office for civil rights of this incident.

though we believe the likelihood that the unauthorized person(s) viewed, retrieved or copied your personal information is low, as a precautionary measure to safeguard your information from potential misuse, we are partnering with experian to provide its experian identityworks product for one year at no charge to you. a description of this product is provided in the attached material, which also contains instructions about how to enroll (including your personal activation code). if you choose to take advantage of the experian identityworks product, it will provide you with identity theft detection and resolution of identity theft services as described in the attached material. in order for us to activate this service, you must complete the enrollment	the breach was caused by an outside party who gained unauthorized access to the email accounts of a contractor and three employees through outlook web access. there is evidence that an email containing personal information, such as name, medical record number, service location, and attending physician's information, was present in one of the compromised inboxes. the breach notification letter states that svmhs does not have evidence that the unauthorized person(s) viewed, retrieved or copied any personal information.

re: legal notice of information security incident

dear sirs or madams:

we write on behalf of our client, accedian networks us inc. ("accedian"), to notify you of a security incident that resulted in the unauthorized access of the personal information of one new hampshire resident.

on may 15, 2020, accedian discovered it was the victim of a ransomware attack. the external threat actor was able to gain access to accedian's systems, infecting certain systems with ransomware and exfiltrating data off of certain servers in the system. once accedian became aware it had been subject to a ransomware attack, the system was contained by shutting down all servers and machines. accedian also immediately put in place an incident response plan and retained forensic experts to contain the incident and determine its scope.

additional containment and responsive measures taken include:
- password reset and multi-factor authentication for all gsuite users;
- separating routing from firewall;
- building a new firewall to support web filtering;
- building a green network with additional vlans;
- revalidating all internal routes(> 5000 ips);
- rebuilding an active directory (windows 2016);
- changing vpn protocol and security (2 factor authentication+ certificate); and
- deploying enterprise wide antivirus/malware/end-point security.

during the investigation, the forensic experts advised that there was insufficient evidence from the logs to identify all files accessed by the attacker, and what data was transferred to the attacker's infrastructure during the incident.

on june 3, 2020, however, accedian received information from the attacker on the files accessed and what data had been transferred during the incident. upon receipt of this information, accedian immediately undertook an assessment to determine the scope of individuals affected in the united states. from this review, accedian determined that the personal information of one new hampshire resident was accessed by the attacker, including name, address, resume, salary or fee schedule, social security number, tax forms banking details for direct deposit purposes and photo identification.

to help protect the identity of impacted individuals, we are offering a complimentary 2 year membership of identity theft and credit monitoring solutions from cyberscout. this product provides superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft. the affected individual will be notified of the incident on july 2, 2020. a copy of the notification letter is enclosed.

dear attorney general macdonald,

i am writing to report a breach of security involving personal information of several new hampshire residents. on may 19, 2020, the inn at deerfield, inc. consulted with a third-party for advice relating to the inn's accounting software. the inn granted the third-party remote access to one of the inn's computers and the financial records stored in the inn's systems. the third-party's access lasted approximately 20 minutes. this was the inn's first and only dealing with the third-party software consultant. after the 20-minute interaction, efforts were made to investigate the third-party further, but that investigation could not confirm the third-party's business or corporate credentials.

after being unable to confirm the credentials of the third-party consultant, the inn retained an information technology provider to wipe clean the one computer the third-party accessed and examine the inn's other computer systems. neither the inn nor the information technology provider believe any data was taken from the inn's systems, but the third-party was able to access the inn's records for the 20-minute period. during that time, it is possible the third-party accessed personal information for purposes other than consulting the inn.

the inn takes protecting personal information seriously and is providing this notice out of an excess of caution in case the third-party consultant was not in fact a legitimate operation. the information to which the third-party had temporary access was limited to that used for payroll, including name, address, social security number, and in some cases, date of birth and direct deposit banking information. our investigation indicates that the third-party could have accessed files containing personal information of 372 current and former employees who, based on the information available to the inn, reside in new hampshire.

the inn mailed notices to these 372 individuals by july 3, 2020. the inn contracted to offer credit monitoring services to these individuals, at no cost to them, for a period of 12 months and provided instructions for enrolling in those services along with the notice sent to them.

the inn makes significant efforts to protect information, but we regrettably allowed this limited access by a third-party. we have taken steps to examine our systems and believe the incident was limited to the brief, 20-minute access by the third-party. we have taken steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. the inn notified law enforcement authorities of this incident, but we did not delay in notifying the affected individuals pending the outcome of a law enforcement investigation.

if you have any questions or concerns about this incident, please contact me, kelly adams, at (855) 255-9404 or at kelly@innatdeerfield.org.

sincerely,

kelly adams
executive director
inn at deerfield, inc.	the breach was caused by a third-party accessing the inn's computer remotely and with unauthorized access. although the investigation did not confirm the third-party's business credentials, the inn took steps to investigate their systems, wiped clean the computer that was accessed, and offered credit monitoring services to affected individuals. the incident was reported to law enforcement authorities, and efforts were made to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.
contents of data breach notification letter: notice of data breach, beverly hills unified school district:

dear bhusd parents/guardians,

beverly hills unified school district (the district) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents. we are writing to address a recent incident that may have involved your data. this notice explains the incident, measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened?

the district uses the aeries student information system to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. in late november 2019, aeries learned that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. upon discovery, aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who aeries believes is now in police custody. on april 27, 2020, we were notified by aeries that this individual may have accessed the district's aeries system. we then contacted aeries, and on may 5, 2020, we were informed that the individual did access parent and student data within the district's aeries system.

what information was involved?

the information accessible to the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties - for the aeries system.

what you can do

even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, we have increased security for passwords. you will be required to change your password to comply with the bulleted list below. you will be required to do so the next time you log on to the aeries parent portal. we recommend you do so immediately. additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well. although this incident was the result of a vulnerability in aeries system, not the district's, we have taken this opportunity to review the district's security as well. to further strengthen account security, your new password must include the following:

- lower case letters
- at least one (1) upper case letter
- at least 1 special character
- at least 1 number
- at least eight (8) characters.

what we are doing

we understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. in order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to potentially access our aeries system. in addition, we and aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

for more information

we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. if you need technical assistance or support, please email tech@bhusd.org. we have also posted a frequently asked questions page for you here. if you have questions or concerns not addressed in the faq, please contact david damico (executive director of technology services and support) at ddamico@bhusd.org.

dear <<first name >> <<last name>>,

recommended steps to help protect your information

2. activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your myidcare membership. the monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. note: you must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. if you need assistance, myidcare will be able to assist you.

3. telephone. contact myidcare at 1-833-431-1276 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

if you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in myidcare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the myidcare website and filing a request for help.

if you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our id care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. in the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an id care specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

credit bureaus
equifax fraud reporting
1-866-349-5191
p.o. box 105069
atlanta, ga 30348-5069
www.equifax.com

experian fraud reporting
1-888-397-3742

transunion fraud reporting
1-800-680-7289
p.o. box 2000
chester, pa 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.	the breach occurred on may 25, 2020, when an individual gained unauthorized access to their databases and systems containing personal health information and medical records on their patients.
contents of data breach notification letter: re: mortgage loan notice of data breach

we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that occurred with one of our due diligence vendors that we hired to perform services on some of our loans, including yours. we also want to let you know about the services we are offering to you at no charge to help protect your continued privacy. at this time, we have no reason to believe that your personal information has been accessed or used inappropriately. however, we are writing this letter to explain what happened, what information was involved, what we have done, and what you can do to protect your continued privacy.

first, we want to explain why we have your personal information. mortgage lenders often sell mortgage loans after they have made them. selling the loans replenishes their funds and enables them to maintain a continuous flow of mortgage funding for new loans. in your case, your mortgage loan was sold to us, the federal home loan mortgage corporation (freddie mac). because you make or have made your mortgage payments to a different company, you probably haven't had direct interactions with freddie mac. the company that you make your mortgage payments to (which may be the lender who originally made the loan to you) is responsible for processing your payments and providing you with customer service. the fact that you are receiving this letter from us does not mean that there has been any change in your mortgage or your relationship with that other company.

what happened?

we recently learned that earlier this year, a vendor we hired to perform due diligence services on some of our loans experienced a ransomware attack on its systems. because the incident left the vendor's system inaccessible to the vendor, the vendor does not know all details of the incident or the information affected.

what information was involved?

while we have no indication that your personal information was accessed or used inappropriately, we have determined that your information, including your loan application data (e.g., name, address, social security number, date of birth, credit and bank account information), was on the vendor's systems at the time of the incident. the vendor has informed us that it has not found any evidence that your personal information, which was encrypted as required by our contract with them, was accessed or taken from its systems by the attackers. however, given the nature and circumstances of the attack, we decided, as a precautionary measure, to make credit	the breach was caused by a ransomware attack on a due diligence vendor's systems, leaving the vendor's system inaccessible and compromising the vendor's information.

re: important notice of data incident. please read this entire letter.

dear [insert name],

we are contacting you as a client of douglas m. smith & company, cpas, to report that between march 31 and april 1, 2020, four (4) tax returns electronically filed by our firm were rejected, apparently because fraudulent returns had already been filed for those taxpayers. your tax return was not rejected, and there is no evidence of any suspicious activity relating to your return; however, as required by law, we are providing this notification to all our clients. we are also providing one year of complimentary credit monitoring, fraud monitoring, and $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance for all clients and their dependents in an abundance of caution. enrollment instructions are provided below under credit monitoring.

we are working with the irs and secret service to ensure that every client receives a full refund, including those identified on any fraudulent returns, and we have directed the irs to flag your account to prevent anyone other than our office from filing a return on your behalf. rest assured, no client needs to worry about losing their refund.

what happened
between march 31, 2020, and april 1, 2020, four (4) electronically filed tax returns were rejected by the intuit lacerte tax preparation software, which lacerte reported was due to the fact that returns were previously filed for those taxpayers. we immediately reported this incident to the irs, secret service, fresno police, and fbi, and, working with lacerte, identified a total of 30 fraudulent returns. you are not among the individuals identified on the 30 fraudulent returns.

we also immediately retained forensic investigators to conduct an investigation, and, to date, we have found no evidence that any unauthorized individual has accessed our computer systems, where your personal information is stored.

is my tax return safe?
yes, all returns are safe. mr. smith has contacted the irs and secret service regarding the 30 fraudulently filed returns and is re-filing those returns in paper format to ensure refunds are paid in full. we have also directed the irs to flag you and all other clients and dependents to prevent filings attempted by anyone other than our office. no client will need to worry about losing their refund.

what information is involved
to the best of our knowledge, there has been no suspicious activity with respect to you or any other clients and dependents who were not identified on the 30 impacted returns. for the 30 fraudulent returns, the taxpayers' social security number, along with public information including name, address, and date of birth, was used to file the return. you are not impacted by the 30 fraudulent returns, but your social security number is stored on our server, which is why we are legally required to provide this notification.

what we are doing
we immediately notified the irs of the 30 impacted returns and directed the irs to flag you and all other clients and dependents to prevent anyone other than our office from filing returns for those individuals. we also retained forensic investigators to analyze our computer systems and information and hired a new it and cybersecurity firm to manage all security going forward. and, we are providing one year of credit monitoring, fraud monitoring, and $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance for all clients and dependents in an abundance of caution to minimize the risk of identity theft.

credit monitoring
we are providing you with one year of access to triple bureau credit monitoring/triple bureau credit report/public records monitoring/cyber monitoring* services at no charge. these services provide you with alerts for twelve months from the date of enrollment when changes occur to any of one of your experian, equifax, or transunion credit files. this notification is sent to you the same day that the change or update takes place with the bureau. also, the following public records will be monitored: change of address, court records, and social security number trace, payday loan, and sex offender. the cyber monitoring will review the dark web and alert you if your personally identifiable information is found online.

in addition, we are providing you with proactive fraud assistance to help with any questions that you might have or in the event you become a victim of identity theft. these services will be provided by cyberscout, a company that specializes in identity theft education and resolution.

to enroll in credit monitoring* services at no charge, please log on to https://www.myidmanager.com and follow the instructions provided. when prompted, please provide the following unique code to receive services: <code here>.

for guidance with the cyberscout services or to obtain additional information about these services, please call the cyberscout help line 1-800-405-6108 and supply the fraud specialist with your unique code.

what you can do
you are encouraged to remain vigilant against identity theft, including over the next twelve to twenty-four months, by regularly reviewing financial account statements and monitoring credit reports for suspicious activity, and to immediately report any unauthorized charges to the card issuer. the phone number to call is usually on the back of the credit or debit card. any incidents of suspected identity theft may be reported to financial institutions and law enforcement.

under u.s. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. you may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report.

you also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. the security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who may access the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies:

re: incident notification

dear sir or madam:

we are writing on behalf of our client, claire's stores, inc. ("claire's"), to notify your office of a security incident involving new hampshire residents.

claire's began an investigation of its e-commerce websites after it was contacted by a security researcher the night of thursday, june 11, 2020, who claimed to have determined that claire's e-commerce site had been compromised. claire's immediately took action to investigate the security researcher's claim and identified and removed unauthorized code in the code that operates its e-commerce site on friday, june 12, 2020.

the added code was capable of obtaining information entered by customers during the checkout process and sending it out of the claire's system. a security firm was engaged, and claire's identified the specific transactions involved. claire's also reinforced the security of its site. purchases made in claire's retail store locations were not involved	the e-commerce site of claire's was compromised and unauthorized code was added, which was able to access customer information during the checkout process and exit the claire's system. a security firm was employed, and specific transactions were identified.

re: data security incident

dear attorney general mcdonald:

wilson elser moskowitz edelman and dicker llp (wilson elser) represents eshel, aminov & partners llp (eshel aminov), an accounting and financial services firm, with respect to a potential data security incident (hereinafter, the incident) described in more detail below. eshel aminov takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

1. nature of the security incident.

beginning on or about march 10, 2019 and ending on or about may 20, 2019, eshel aminov experienced a business email compromise in which an unknown cyber attacker gained access to eshel aminov's business email environment as a result of an email phishing scheme.

eshel aminov does not know what, if any, personal information belonging to its clients was either acquired or accessed by the unknown cyber attacker as a result of this incident. however, the individual responsible for the incident had the means to access and/or acquire unencrypted documents within eshel aminov's business email environment that contained social security numbers, financial information, payment card information, and tax-related information of eshel aminov's clients.

again, at this time, eshel aminov has no evidence that the cyber attacker actually viewed or acquired any personal information or that any fraud of misuse of any personal information has occurred due to the incident.

eshel aminov first discovered the incident on or about may 10, 2019, at which time it swiftly took steps to secure its business email environment. eshel aminov has since gone to great lengths to identify and notify any individuals who were potentially impacted as result of this incident including (1) a thorough internal review of tens of thousands of client files (2) the hiring of a third-party vendor to organize and process eshel aminov client mailing data and (3) the hiring of a third-party vendor to arrange for any potentially affected individuals to receive credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.

2. number of new hampshire residents affected.

on or about april 15, 2020, eshel aminov finished identifying a population of six (6) new hampshire residents that were potentially affected by this incident. incident notification letters addressed to these individuals were mailed on july 8, 2020, via first class mail. a sample copy of the two versions of the incident notification letters being mailed to potentially affected residents of new hampshire are included with this letter.

3. steps taken.

eshel aminov has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. these steps include resetting eshel aminov employees' access credentials through a global firm-wide password reset, implementing additional layers of security to eshel aminov's email platform, and reviewing the ways confidential information is transmitted within the firm. additionally, eshel established a new client portal for secure transfer of data. eshel aminov has also provided potentially impacted individuals with notice of the incident and complimentary, online credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to all notified residents of new hampshire for twelve (12) months.

4. contact information.

eshel aminov remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information within its control. if you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at anjali.das@wilsonelser.com or (312) 821-6164.

we recently began an investigation of our e-commerce websites, and on june 12, 2020, we identified and removed computer code that had been added to our site by an unauthorized person. the added code was capable of obtaining information entered by customers during the checkout process and sending that information out of our system. a security firm was engaged, and we identified the specific transactions involved. we also reinforced the security of our site. purchases made in our retail store locations were not involved.

findings from the investigation show the code was first added on april 7, 2020. there were several times from april 7 to june 12 when the added code was not present because of new code deployments. we are notifying you because you placed an order during a time the added code was present.

3. consider placing a security freeze on your credit file.

if you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a security freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. a security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. you may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:

equifax security freeze
p.o. box 105788
atlanta, ga 30348
https://www.freeze.equifax.com
1-800-685-1111

experian security freeze

transunion security freeze
p.o. box 2000
chester, pa 19016
http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze
1-888-909-8872

in order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

if your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name, or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the city in which you currently reside.

if you do place a security freeze prior to enrolling in the credit monitoring service as described above, you will need to remove the freeze in order to sign up for the credit monitoring service. after you sign up for the credit monitoring service, you may refreeze your credit file.

4. obtaining a free credit report.

under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. verify all information is correct. if you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

5. additional helpful resources.

even if you	an unauthorized individual gained access to a limited number of employee email accounts at the vermont country store. after a comprehensive investigation and document review, they found that the compromised email account(s) contained customers' full names and social security numbers.

dear attorney general macdonald:

we are writing to notify you of two potential data security incidents involving approximately 77,296 new hampshire residents.

in 2016, morgan stanley closed two data centers and decommissioned computer equipment that processed client information in both locations. as is customary, we contracted with a vendor to remove the data from the devices. we subsequently learned that certain devices believed to have been wiped of all information still contained some unencrypted data (the "data center event").

separately, in 2019, morgan stanley disconnected and replaced computer servers (the "waas device") in local branch offices. those servers had stored information on encrypted disks that may have included personal information. during a recent inventory, we were unable to locate a small number of those devices. the manufacturer subsequently informed us of a software flaw that could have resulted in small amounts of previously deleted data remaining on the disks in unencrypted form (the "waas device event").

we have worked with outside technical experts to understand the facts and any potential risks for both events. we are not aware of any access to or misuse of personal information in connection with either of these incidents.

for both events, we investigated the disposition and handling of the devices, and worked with outside technical experts to understand any potential risks to customer data in light of the technical characteristics and configuration of each of the relevant devices. in addition, we have continuously monitored active accounts as well as internet and "dark web" forums for any evidence of misuse of morgan stanley data and have not detected any unauthorized activity related to the incident.

nonetheless, we decided that, in an abundance of caution, on july 10, 2020, we would provide notice of the data center event and the waas device event to individuals whose information may have been on the devices when they left our possession.

data that potentially could have remained on the devices may have included account names and numbers (at morgan stanley and any linked bank accounts), social security numbers, passport numbers, contact information, dates of birth, and asset value and holdings data. note that any data on the devices did not contain credit or debit card numbers or passwords that could be used to access financial accounts.

we are notifying approximately 77,296 new hampshire residents who may have been affected via a written notice that will be delivered by the u.s. postal service or, where electronic communications have been authorized by the customer, via our e-communications system. a sample copy of the notice is attached hereto.

as noted above, we have continuously monitored this situation and have not detected any unauthorized activity relating to this incident. in addition, for any potentially impacted account, we have instituted enhanced security procedures, including continuous fraud monitoring and monitoring of information about malicious online activity and evidence of misuse of any morgan stanley data. we have also arranged with experian to provide any potentially affected individuals with credit monitoring services for 24 months at no charge to them.

finally, in addition to the measures described above, we have taken steps to further strengthen controls aimed at reducing the risk that such an incident could occur in the future.

to the extent you have any questions about this notification, please contact my colleague, akinyemi akiwowo at (212) 537-1592 or akinyemi.akiwowo@morganstanley.com for additional information.

avoiding phishing. please use caution when responding to third parties who request disclosure of your personal information via email, text, or phone. this may include inquiries from third parties posing as bank officials, information security experts, government agencies, and other trusted sources, in an effort to trick you into divulging your personal information.

you should never provide personal information, such as usernames, passwords, government-issued personal identification numbers (e.g., u.s. social security numbers), account numbers, or any other confidential personal information via email request or screen pop-ups. legitimate agencies/companies do not ask for this type of information in an email. we will never ask for your account password by email or by phone.

remain vigilant. as always, you should monitor your statements for any activity you do not recognize. contact us immediately to report any suspicious activity.

you also should not click links or open attachments sent from atypical or unknown senders, even if they appear to be legitimate. pay special attention to links that purportedly take you to websites or other resources related to this incident or offer you services to assist with this incident. when in doubt, call your regular morgan stanley contact to verify the legitimacy of the communication.

ordering your free credit report. you are entitled under u.s. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. to order your credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 877-322-8228. we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports.

notice of data breach

dear account holder,

the chronicle of higher education, inc. takes data security very seriously, and we understand the importance of protecting the information we maintain. we are writing to inform you about an incident that may have involved some information related to your online account(s) to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and/or chroniclevitae.com. this notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened:

on june 19, 2020, the chronicle completed our investigation of reports we received that some of our data may have become accessible online. through the investigation, we confirmed that unauthorized parties made data for some online accounts to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and chroniclevitae.com accessible online. upon learning of this, the chronicle launched an investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm, and law enforcement was notified. through the investigation, the chronicle determined that unauthorized parties had exploited a vulnerability in one of the chronicle's servers, through which they were able to obtain limited account information.

what information was involved:

our investigation determined that the account information posted online only contained your name, email address, username(s), and password(s) for your online account(s) to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and/or chroniclevitae.com. although the chronicle hashed and salted passwords for online accounts in our database, meaning that a cryptographic process was used to render the actual passwords indecipherable to third parties and that they were not maintained in plain text, the unauthorized parties were able to bypass the cryptographic hashing and salting process, making the passwords for some online accounts accessible in plain text.

what you can do:

the chronicle reset passwords to all online accounts on june 16, 2020, so that the passwords for the accounts are no longer valid. if you have not logged in since that date, the next time you log in to your online account(s), you will be prompted to change your password(s). also, if you use the same username(s) and password(s) for any other online account, we recommend that you change your password there as well.

what we are doing:

to date, we have no evidence that there has been any unauthorized access to your online account(s); however, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. in addition to resetting the password(s) to all online accounts using stronger hashing and salting technology, we have taken steps to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, including the replacement of the server with the unauthorized access, as well as additional procedures to further expand and strengthen security processes.

for more information:

we regret any inconvenience or concern this may cause you. if you have any questions, please call 1-833-579-1097, monday-friday, 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., eastern daylight time.

contents of data breach notification letter: re: notice of data breach

dear <<first and last name>>,

we are writing to inform you about a security incident that occurred on the lacba.org website. on june 11, 2020, we discovered that unauthorized cybercriminals had placed malicious code on our website, which copied member payment card information and other data as it was entered on the site. the cybercriminals then transferred this information to a server they operated. we understand that these cybercriminals targeted many bar associations and professional organizations, not just lacba.

as soon as we learned of this issue, we took steps to prevent any further theft of our members' personal information and began an internal investigation. we have also retained an independent forensic firm. the following details are based on our current understanding of this incident but may be subject to change.

what happened? on june 11, 2020, a financial institution alerted lacba that there was malicious code present on specific portions of its website, lacba.org. further investigation of the incident established that the malicious code was present at least as early as may 10, 2020.

what information was involved? our internal investigation indicates that the information compromised as a result of this incident includes your first and last name, 16-digit payment card number(s), username, password, attorney bar number (if used as a username), and any other information you typed into the website at that time.

what we are doing? we have eliminated the code that enabled unauthorized access to the personal information and have engaged an independent forensic firm to review our systems and recommend any additional necessary changes.

what you can do? if you have not already done so, you should change your lacba.org password and your password for all other online accounts for which you use the same username or email address and password. we recommend that you contact the financial institution that issued the payment card you used on lacba.org and alert them to the compromise of your payment card information. we also recommend that you review your account statements for any suspicious or unauthorized charges between at least as early as may 10, 2020, and the present, and to contact your financial institution if you identify any such charges. in addition, we recommend that you regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies.

for more information: if you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at 1-833-431-1282.

sincerely,

stan bissey

office of the attorney general of iowa
1305 e. walnut street
des moines, iowa 50319-0106
consumer@ag.iowa.gov

dear attorney general miller:

we are writing to notify you of two potential data security incidents involving iowa residents.

in 2016, morgan stanley closed two data centers and decommissioned computer equipment that processed client information in both locations. as is customary, we contracted with a vendor to remove the data from the devices. we subsequently learned that certain devices believed to have been wiped of all information still contained some unencrypted data (the data center event).

separately, in 2019, morgan stanley disconnected and replaced certain computer servers (the waas device) in local branch offices. those servers had stored information on encrypted disks that may have included personal information. during a recent inventory, we were unable to locate a small number of those devices. the manufacturer subsequently informed us of a software flaw that could have resulted in small amounts of previously deleted data remaining on the disks in unencrypted form (the waas device event).

we have worked with outside technical experts to understand the facts and any potential risks. we are not aware of any access to or misuse of personal information in connection with either of these incidents.

for both events, we investigated the disposition and handling of the devices, and worked with outside technical experts to understand any potential risks to customer data in light of the technical characteristics and configuration of each of the relevant devices. in addition, we have continuously monitored active accounts as well as internet and dark web forums for any evidence of misuse of morgan stanley data and have not detected any unauthorized activity related to the incident.

nonetheless, we decided that, in an abundance of caution, on july 10, 2020, we would provide notice of the data center event and the waas device event to individuals whose information may have been on the devices when they left our possession.

data that potentially could have remained on the devices may have included account names and numbers (at morgan stanley and any linked bank accounts), social security numbers, passport numbers, contact information, dates of birth, and asset value and holdings data. note that any data on the devices did not contain credit or debit card numbers or passwords that could be used to access financial accounts.

we are notifying iowa residents who may have been affected via a written notice that will be delivered by the u.s. postal service or, where electronic communications have been authorized by the customer, via our e-communications system. a sample copy of the notice is attached hereto.

as noted above, we have continuously monitored this situation and have not detected any unauthorized activity relating to this incident. in addition, for any potentially impacted account, we have instituted enhanced security procedures, including continuous fraud monitoring and monitoring of information about malicious online activity and evidence of misuse of any morgan stanley data. we have also arranged with experian to provide any potentially affected individuals with credit monitoring services for 24 months at no charge to them.

finally, in addition to the measures described above, we have taken steps to further strengthen controls aimed at reducing the risk that such an incident could occur in the future.

to the extent you have any questions about this notification, please contact my colleague, akinyemi akiwowo at (212) 537-1592 or akinyemi.akiwowo@morganstanley.com for additional information.

dear patient,

notice of data breach

what happened?

on the morning of monday, june 1, 2020, we discovered that our computer network had been hacked and our computer terminals could not be used.

what information was involved?

the computers stored both dental records and payment information, including social security numbers of several patients and insurance information. as a result, your personal information is now potentially accessible to unauthorized individuals.

what we did

immediately upon discovery, we contacted a local it company and another it company in the state of new york to resolve the issue. we paid ransom to the hacker and it companies to obtain the data. everything has been resolved. we will report to the state attorney general, fbi, and hhs.

what you can do

we encourage you to take the following steps to protect yourself from risks associated with this breach of your data:

dental records and dental insurance information:

regularly review the explanation of benefits statement that you receive from your insurance administrator. if you see any services listed that you did not receive, contact your administrator immediately at the number on your statement. you should also check your credit receipts for dental bills that you do not recognize. if you find anything suspicious, call the credit reporting agency at the number on the report.

social security number:

place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit files. a fraud alert requires potential creditors to use what the law refers to as reasonable policies and procedures to verify your identity before issuing credit in your name. the alert will remain on your accounts for 90 days. a security freeze will lock your credit files so nobody can access them to obtain credit in your name. you can unlock them temporarily or permanently at any time. you can request a fraud alert or security freeze through any one of the three reporting agencies. experian 888.397.3742, equifax 800.525.6285, and transunion 800.680.7289. you can also request a credit report from any of these agencies, which you should check for suspicious activity. if you find anything, contact local authorities and file a report of identity theft. ask for a copy of the police report, as you may need to supply this to your creditors.

financial account numbers:

fortunately, your bank account number or credit card number is not on the computer when receipt of payment has been posted. only your credit card number is documented on paper with your chart.

online account information:

reset your username, password, and security questions and answer on your email if you furnished your email address. contact your service provider for additional guidance.

for more information

if there is anything that city dental can do to assist you, please contact us at (831) 753-9505 or via email at citydentalsalinas@yahoo.com.

sincerely,

dr. youngrim kim	the breach reported by city dental appears to be the result of an outside party hacking their computer network and accessing both dental records and payment information, including social security numbers of several patients and insurance information.

re: notice of data security incident

dear office of the attorney general:

this firm represents the federal home loan mortgage corporation ("freddie mac'') and we are writing to notify you regarding the nature and circumstances of a recent data security incident involving a ransomware attack suffered by one of freddie mac's vendors. the data security incident potentially affects personal information of individual borrowers whose mortgage loans were sold to freddie mac.

on may 20, 2020, it came to freddie mac's attention that, earlier this year on an unknown date, a vendor freddie mac hired to perform services on some of its loans experienced a ransomware attack on systems that contained personal information of individual borrowers. at this time, freddie mac has no evidence that the personal information of affected borrowers has in fact been accessed or used inappropriately. freddie mac has been in communication with the vendor since learning of the incident. because the incident left the vendor's system inaccessible to the vendor, the vendor did not immediately know the details of the incident or the information affected. many details are still uncertain.

after investigation, freddie mac has determined that information on the vendor's systems at the time of the ransomware incident included loan application data of individual borrowers including name, address, social security number, date of birth, credit and bank account information. the vendor has informed freddie mac that it has not found any evidence that personal information, which was encrypted as required by freddie mac's contract with the vendor, was accessed or taken from	the breach was caused by a ransomware attack suffered by one of freddie mac's vendors, which affected the personal information of individual borrowers.

steel partners values our employees and stakeholders and understands the importance of protecting personal information. we are writing to inform you about an incident that may involve some of your information. this incident may have involved personal information concerning you that was collected by a steel partners entity relating to your employment, your status as a beneficiary of a current or former employee, your participation in a pension plan, or your status as a beneficiary of a pension plan participant. steel partners entities include steel partners, portfolio companies of steel partners, and pension plans administered by steel partners.

what happened

steel partners recently discovered unauthorized activity in the email account of one of its employees. it immediately initiated an investigation, which identified unauthorized access to that email account. steel partners locked the account and promptly engaged a forensic security firm to assist. the investigation identified that the method by which the email account was accessed allowed for a local download of the entire mailbox. on may 29, 2020, it was determined that there were documents within the employee's email account that contained personal information. a broader review of our systems indicated that only one email account was impacted. we are notifying you because some of your personal information was contained in documents within the steel partners employee's email account.

what information was involved

the impacted email account contained documents that may have contained your first name, last name, social security number, and date of birth or health information related to disability or workers compensation claims.

what you can do

while we have no indication that your personal information has been misused, we encourage you to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring	the breach seems to be an unintended disclosure, as the email account of an employee was accessed without authorization, allowing the download of personal information, but no hacking or intentional breach is mentioned.

given the nature of the attack, we do not yet have a complete understanding of the scope of the unauthorized access to our data. we do, however, have reason to believe that such unauthorized access encompassed access to or loss of certain personal data stored on our it systems.

what we are doing.

upon learning of the unauthorized access, we promptly retained the industry-leading cybersecurity firm, mandiant of fireeye, inc.

you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

dear doj: consumer protection bureau,

i am writing on behalf of collabera, inc. (collabera) to inform you of a data incident that may have involved employees' personal information. on june 8, 2020, collabera identified malware in its network system consistent with a ransomware attack. we promptly restored access to our data from backup files, and the malware has been removed from the system. we immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this event. on june 10, we became aware that the unauthorized party obtained some data from our system. we are working with outside forensic experts and law enforcement to conduct a more detailed review of the incident.

based on our investigation to date, it appears the unauthorized party was first in collabera's environment on may 24, 2020. we believe the incident likely involved some employee personal information. the information potentially involved varied, but may have included first and last names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, dates of birth, employee benefits and employee verification information, passport/visa information, and email addresses.

though we have no reason to believe that employees' personal information has been misused for the purpose of committing fraud or identity theft, we are providing individual notifications and taking protective measures out of an abundance of caution. collabera cares about protecting the identity of its employees and is therefore offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection for two years. individual notifications detailing the incident and the enrollment process were mailed to new hampshire residents on july 10, 2020. based on our investigation, it appears that 129 residents from new hampshire may have been impacted.

remedial steps collabera has taken in response to this incident	the malware in collabera's network system was consistent with a ransomware attack, indicating that this was a hacking incident.
insufficient information	there is no information available in the provided description about the type of breach.
insufficient information	not enough information given to determine the type of breach.

re: data security incident

dear attorney general macdonald:

we represent the mcpherson college (mcpherson), headquartered in mcpherson, kansas with respect to a potential data security incident described in more detail below. mcpherson takes the security and privacy of their student and employee information very seriously and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

1. nature of the security incident.

on or about october 3, 2019, mcpherson college discovered that a single employee's email account may have been compromised. mcpherson immediately took action to secure the email account and conduct an investigation into the incident. mcpherson proceeded to engage a third-party computer forensics firm to conduct a thorough investigation. that investigation concluded in or about november 2019 and found that a single employee's email account had been compromised. mcpherson then proceeded to engage a third-party e-discovery vendor to review the contents of the compromised email account and create a list of individuals that would need to be notified as a result of unknown/unauthorized threat actor accessing the compromised email account. on june 3, 2020, after a thorough and full search of the material accessible within the email account, mcpherson received a final list of the names and addresses of the individuals whose information may have been accessed by the unauthorized/unknown third party. the unknown unauthorized threat actor may have been able to access the affected individuals' name in addition to possibly their passport number, driver's license number, government id number, credit card number and cvv, student loan information, limited personal health information, and/or date of birth.

2. number of new hampshire residents affected.

a total of two (2) new hampshire residents may have been potentially affected by this incident. notification letters to these individuals were mailed on july 10, 2020, by first-class mail. a sample copy of the notification letter is included with this letter.

3. steps taken.

mcpherson takes the security and privacy of the information very seriously and has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future, as well as to protect the privacy and security of potentially impacted individuals' information. these include but are not limited to implementing multi-factor authentication, forcing password changes, strengthening the security of their email tenant, and reporting the incident to the appropriate government regulators as required. additionally, the affected individuals were provided with credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for a period of 1 year through epiq.

4. contact information.

mcpherson remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information in its control. if you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at anjali.das@wilsonelser.com or (312) 821-6164.

hello [name],

we are writing to inform you that there was a breach of beeradvocate user data that occurred between 2012 and 2013. after an investigation by an independent third-party cybersecurity firm, it was confirmed that beeradvocate user login credentials (email address, beeradvocate forum password) were lost and aggregated along with breaches of other websites into a breach dataset that became known as couponmom 2014. we are notifying you as your beeradvocate forum login credentials may have been affected at that time. it is important to note that beeradvocate did not possess or lose any financial information or information that is likely to lead to identity theft.

the exact method of breach could not be determined, due to the incident occurring seven to eight years ago. however, from the number of emails involved and understanding the password hashing scheme in use in that timeframe, it is possible that the beeradvocate third-party forum software user database was compromised, and a since-retired password hashing method allowed some passwords to be derived. these credentials appear to have been aggregated along with breaches of other sites into the breach dataset that became known as couponmom 2014. this notification was not delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

beeradvocate user login credentials (email address, beeradvocate forum password) were lost and aggregated along with breaches of other websites into a breach dataset that became known as couponmom 2014.

new management at next glass has thoroughly investigated this matter in order to disclose the relevant information needed to provide transparency. in the years since 2013, beeradvocate's forum software and its password hashing scheme has been upgraded to salted multiple iteration-sha-256. website traffic is encrypted and routed through a reputable internet security provider. two-factor authentication (2fa) is offered to all users. since the acquisition of certain beeradvocate assets in february 2020, beeradvocate's platform has been migrated to a more secure infrastructure. password resets have been initiated in tandem with email contact to the beeradvocate user community. we prioritize user data and safety and have continued to upgrade the platform's infrastructure to ensure best-in-class data protection.

we recommend that you reset any password that is/was similar to the password you used for beeradvocate. please review the enclosed "additional resources" section included with this letter. this section describes additional steps you can take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the federal trade commission regarding identity theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.

if you have any questions, please contact support@beeradvocate.com or call the toll numbers included below.

re: notification of a data security incident

dear attorney general macdonald:

we represent u.s. restaurants, inc. (usri) in connection with a recent incident that may have impacted the personal information of twelve (12) new hampshire residents. usri is reporting the incident pursuant to n.h. rev. stat. ann. 359-c:20. this notice will be supplemented, if necessary, with any new significant facts discovered subsequent to its submission. while usri is notifying you of this incident, usri does not waive any rights or defenses relating to the incident or this notice, or the applicability of new hampshire on personal jurisdiction.

nature of the security breach or unauthorized use or access

usri has learned that, on february 7, 2020, an unauthorized third party accessed a number of usri's computer systems without authorization and infected those systems with ransomware. upon learning of the situation, usri promptly launched an internal investigation and secured its computer systems to prevent potential further access. usri also retained a leading forensic security firm to investigate the incident and confirm the security of its computer systems.

after identifying the scope of the incident, usri worked with a document review vendor to conduct a programmatic review of the contents of the impacted accounts, and then manually review the items identified as potentially at risk by that programmatic review. due to the scope of the incident and the amount of data involved, this process took a considerable amount of time. on june 15, 2020, usri determined the identity of the impacted individuals and worked to identify addresses for those individuals and update the addresses based on the national change of address database. this research resulted in usri determining that the impacted systems contained the personal information of twelve (12) new hampshire residents. the impacted information included individuals' names and social security numbers.

at this point, usri is not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a result of this incident, and cannot confirm if any personal information was actually obtained by an unauthorized person. nevertheless, because certain computer systems were accessed by the unauthorized third party, and usri cannot determine exactly what, if any, information may have been obtained, usri is notifying individuals whose personal information could have been accessed.

number of new hampshire residents affected

usri has identified twelve (12) new hampshire residents whose information may have been accessed by the unauthorized third party.	an unauthorized third party accessed the organization's computer systems without authorization and infected those systems with ransomware. the organization promptly launched an internal investigation and secured its computer systems to prevent potential further access. a forensic security firm was also retained to investigate the incident and confirm the security of its computer systems. due to the scope of the incident and the amount of data involved, it took a considerable amount of time to review the contents of the impacted accounts. the impacted information included individuals' names and social security numbers, and us restaurants inc is notifying individuals whose personal information could have been accessed.

dear first name last name:

we recently learned of a potential compromise of certain information about you located at a walgreens store. we are contacting you to provide you with information about the incident and also with information about steps you can take to protect yourself.

what happened

sometime between may 26 and june 5, 2020, various groups of individuals broke into multiple walgreens stores and forced entry into the secured pharmacy at select locations, including your preferred walgreens. among the many items stolen were certain items containing health-related information such as filled prescriptions waiting for customer pick up and paper records. this included a very limited number of hard drives that were attached to stolen cash registers. these hard drives contained information about certain recent pharmacy purchases completed at that cash register. one pharmacy automation device that stored prescription labeling information for a short time period was also involved.

between may 26 and june 5, walgreens discovered customer information was impacted. we later determined that one or more of the items described above may have contained your information. we wanted to alert you to this fact.

what information was involved

- vaccination information including eligibility information
- email address
- balance rewards number
- photo id number - drivers license, state id, military id, or passport (e.g. for purchases such as pseudoephedrine)

what we are doing

upon learning of the potential compromise of information, walgreens promptly took steps to close out and re-enter impacted prescriptions in our system to prevent potential fraud regarding the original prescription. insurance claims were also reversed for any stolen filled prescriptions that had already been billed to health plans. walgreens is coordinating with local law enforcement where appropriate. further, walgreens regularly evaluates its safeguards and will continue to do so.

what you can do

walgreens recommends that you monitor your prescription and medical records. further, as a general matter, we recommend the following actions as good practices our customers can take to protect themselves from medical identity theft:

- review your explanation of benefits statement which you get from your health insurance company. follow up with your insurance company or the care provider for any items you don't recognize. ask your insurance company for a current year-to-date report of all services paid for you as a beneficiary. follow-up with your insurance company or care provider for any items you don't recognize.
- additionally, even though your financial information was not involved, we have enclosed information on steps you can take to further protect your information, and how to obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three (3) major credit reporting agencies as a courtesy for your reference.

notice of data breach

please read this entire letter.

dear <<individual mailing name>>,

we hope that you, your family, and loved ones are doing as well as possible during these challenging times. as you likely know, cybersecurity-related incidents are on the rise and, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to notify you that an unauthorized person recently accessed a limited number of wealth enhancement group individual employees' email accounts. following our investigation, we have concluded that your specific nonpublic personal information may have been accessed by an unauthorized person as a result of this incident. we recognize the concern this may cause, and we want to inform you of the steps we have taken and provide you with information on steps you can take to further protect your personal information.

what happened?

during our preliminary investigation, we learned that on march 22, 2020, an unauthorized person gained access to a limited number of employees' email accounts through a process called phishing. phishing occurs when a third-party bad actor is disguised to appear as though it is a known source requesting authorized access to user or email account information, such as a password. because we have proactively invested in sophisticated cybersecurity technology and training, we were promptly alerted of the threat and took immediate action to secure the impacted email accounts. on june 11, 2020, we concluded our investigation and confirmed that you may have had nonpublic personal information affected by this incident.

what are we doing?

after becoming aware of this incident, we took prompt action to secure the limited number of employees' individual email accounts to help ensure that the unauthorized person no longer had access. we also took additional steps to contain the situation, including engaging outside information security and technology experts to assist in our review and investigation of the incident. as part of this investigation, our information security and technology experts were engaged to determine what, if any, information may have been able to be accessed.

because we want you to have maximum peace of mind, we are offering a complimentary 24-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection package through experian identityworkssm. to activate your membership and start monitoring your personal information, please follow the steps found in attachment 1 to this letter.

in addition to our existing security measures, we have reviewed and implemented additional options to enhance our technology and security practices to reduce the risk of a similar issue occurring in the future.

what information may have been involved?

the information that the unauthorized person may have been able to access may have included full name, address phone number, email address, social security number, driver's license number or state identification number, or financial account numbers.

what you can do.

in addition to using the credit monitoring and identity theft protection described in attachment 1 of this letter, we recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports to detect errors resulting from the security incident. promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to your financial institutions or company with which the account is maintained, as well as applicable authorities, including local law enforcement, your state attorney general, and the federal trade commission (ftc). individuals also have the right to obtain a police report in the event one has been created for this incident. additionally, to minimize the risk of tax return fraud, the ftc and the irs both generally recommend that individuals file their income taxes for each year as early as possible.

please note that we will not email or call you regarding this incident to ask for your personal information. we suggest that you remain cautious when opening emails, clicking on links, responding to requests for entering network credentials, or giving personal information over the phone to anyone claiming to be from wealth enhancement group.

for more information.

we are strongly committed to protecting your personal information, and we apologize for any concern this situation has caused. for further information and assistance, please contact <<advisor_name>>, a member of the financial advisory team at wealth enhancement group.

re: notice of security incident

dear attorney general macdonald:

we are writing on behalf of our client, ply gem residential solutions ("ply gem"), to provide notice of a security incident involving eight new hampshire residents.

ply gem recently concluded its investigation of a data security incident that involved unauthorized access to certain employee's email accounts. upon learning of this, ply gem immediately secured the email accounts, launched an investigation, and engaged a cybersecurity firm to assist. the investigation determined that an unauthorized person accessed the email accounts at various times between july 26, 2019 and november 18, 2019. the investigation was not able to determine which emails and attachments, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized person.

therefore, ply gem conducted a comprehensive review of the contents of the email accounts and, on june 25, 2020, determined that an email or an attachment to an email in the accounts contained the names, social security numbers, drivers' license numbers, financial account information, and/or payment card information of eight new hampshire residents.

on july 24, 2020, ply gem will begin mailing notification letters to the new hampshire residents in substantially the same form as the enclosed letter via u.s. first-class mail in accordance with n.h. rev. stat. 359-c:20(c). ply gem is offering eligible individuals a complimentary, one-year membership to credit monitoring and identity protection services. ply gem has also established a dedicated, toll-free call center where individuals may obtain more information regarding the incident.

to help prevent this type of incident from happening in the future, ply gem is implementing enhanced security measures and providing additional training to employees.

re: blackbaud data breach

dear consumer protection bureau,

as per my conversation with peter in your office this morning, i am writing to report a data security incident at a third-party service provider that involved some personal information of people in our database. blackbaud, a cloud computing service provider used by star island corporation and numerous other organizations worldwide, alerted us on july 16 about the incident. on july 23, we emailed everybody in our database about this incident. of the people in our database, 7,268 are from new hampshire.

blackbaud has informed us that the data fields with credit card numbers, bank account information, and social security numbers were not part of the ransomware attack, which was conducted by a cybercriminal who gained access to their system on february 7, 2020, and may have gained access to data through may 20, 2020. blackbaud informs us that they paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed, and they have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

re: lincoln national life insurance company
referring to as lnl

pursuant to nh rev. stat. 359-c:20, i am writing to notify you of an incident that may have caused the personal information of one new hampshire resident to be subject to unauthorized access. lincoln financial securities recently discovered that the email accounts of one of its independent financial advisors had been accessed by an unauthorized person from may 1, 2020, to may 3, 2020. we determined on thursday, july 2, that the personal information of the new hampshire resident, such as name, address, social security number, date of birth, bank account information, driver's license number, medical information, and/or financial account information, may have been exposed due to this unauthorized access.

when lincoln learned of the access to the email account of the independent advisor, lincoln quickly took action to assist the advisor in securing their account. lincoln provided an alert to all advisors regarding a phishing email that had been directed at advisors, required all advisors to do a password reset for their email accounts, and worked with the third-party service provider that managed the email accounts of the independent advisors to determine the nature of the access to the accounts and make configuration changes to the email accounts.

attached is a draft notification which will be mailed to new hampshire residents on or around july 24, 2020, and will include an offer of complimentary credit monitoring services for one year. the letter will also be mailed with a copy of the additional resources insert.

we continue to work diligently to minimize the impact of this incident and enhance our cybersecurity posture, as appropriate. i trust that this notice will provide you with all of the information required to assess this matter. please let me know if you have any additional questions, or if i may be of further assistance.

re: legal notice of information security incident

dear sirs or madams:

we write on behalf of our client, pivot technology services corp. ("pivot"), to notify you of a security incident which resulted in the unauthorized access and exfiltration of the personal information of 1 new hampshire resident.

on june 12, 2020, pivot discovered that it was the victim of a cybersecurity attack by an unauthorized third party by which the malicious actor deployed ransomware in an attempt to encrypt pivot's technology infrastructure. upon detection of the attack, pivot engaged an industry-leading cyber forensic firm, crowdstrike, to conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine how the security incident occurred, the scope of such incident, and to assist it with remediation efforts.

with the assistance of the forensic firm, pivot immediately implemented countermeasures to minimize the encryption of its systems. as a result, some pivot employees experienced complications with email, however, there were no interruptions to its business operations.

on july 1, 2020, pivot discovered that the unauthorized third party had in fact gained access to and exfiltrated the personal information of pivot's employees residing in the united states and immediately undertook an additional investigation to determine the scope of the information affected.

on july 7, 2020, pivot determined that the following personal information of employees was compromised in the incident: names, addresses, payroll earnings, deductions, 401k, benefits, bank routing and account numbers, bank account names, and social security numbers. from the investigation, we have determined that the unauthorized third party had access to pivot's systems between june 9, 2020, and june 12, 2020.

in response to the incident, pivot expedited the implementation process for multifactor authentication (mfa) for all applications that are accessed remotely. in addition, pivot will implement additional safeguards in accordance with the recommendations of the forensic firm, including crowdstrike falcon, mimecast url filtering process, and cisco umbrella, a secure gateway to protect users access.

pivot has also conducted a thorough review of the potentially affected records and continues to review existing policies and procedures designed to try to prevent a similar occurrence from happening again. in addition, to help protect the identity of impacted individuals, we are offering a complimentary 2-year membership of equifax id patrol. this product provides superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft. all potentially affected individuals will be notified of the incident on july 24, 2020. a copy of the notification letter is enclosed.

if you have any questions or need further information regarding this incident, please contact me (514) 971 2497 or julie.himo@nortonrosefulbright.com.

note: only a subset of braingenie users were impacted by this security incident.

what happened?

in early june, we received a report mentioning braingenie as one of the websites potentially impacted by a security incident. we immediately launched an investigation with the help of forensic experts and law enforcement to determine if any user information was affected.

the investigation revealed that our systems were accessed without authorization starting in late february. on july 15, we discovered that unauthorized actors obtained a small amount of personal information from a braingenie test (qa) database. we have been assessing the personal information impacted and identifying affected individuals since then.

what information was involved?

based on reports and our investigation, we believe that the personal information that may have been affected includes user login credentials for braingenie accounts, which for some users includes a username and/or email address and password. although we encrypt our users' passwords, we believe that unauthorized actors may have been able to derive text passwords for some accounts.

what are we doing?

after learning of this incident, we reviewed our security protocols and took additional steps to enhance our security. we have been in communication with law enforcement and are continuing to cooperate with their wider investigation.

what you can do?

we recommend that you change your password for your braingenie account. the next time you log in to braingenie, you will be prompted to change your password. please choose a strong password that is not easy to guess and is not one that you use for any other online account.

we also recommend that you change your password for any other online accounts for which you use the same username and password or email address and password combination. please contact us if you notice any suspicious activity in your braingenie account.

more information

if you have any questions about this incident or resetting your braingenie password, you may contact us at support@braingenie.com or +1 (650) 272-0606.

although we do not collect or maintain your financial information, we are required by law to notify you of the following: we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports. if you believe you are a victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission (ftc) and/or the office of the attorney general (ago) in your state. you may also report any suspected identity theft to law enforcement.

iin learned recently that an iin employee was the victim of a phishing attack which resulted in an unauthorized party temporarily obtaining access to one iin employee email account between march 3, 2020, and march 4, 2020. upon learning of this issue, iin immediately secured this account and launched an investigation in consultation with outside cybersecurity professionals who regularly investigate and analyze these types of situations to analyze the extent of any compromise of the email account and the security of the emails and attachments contained within them.

iin devoted considerable time and effort to determine what information was contained in the affected email accounts. based on its comprehensive investigation and document review, iin discovered on june 22, 2020, that the compromised email account contained a limited amount of personal information. the information included the affected residents' full names and one (1) or more of the following: social security numbers and/or financial account information. not all of the affected residents had their social security numbers impacted by this incident. iin has no indication that any information has been misused.

nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, iin wanted to inform you (and the affected residents) of the incident and to explain the steps that it is taking to help safeguard the impacted residents against identity fraud. iin is providing the affected residents with written notification of this incident commencing on or about july 22, 2020, in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto. iin is providing residents with social security numbers included in the account with 12 months of credit monitoring and is advising the affected residents to always remain vigilant in reviewing financial account statements for fraudulent or irregular activity on a regular basis. iin is advising the affected residents about the process for placing a fraud alert and/or security freeze on their credit files and obtaining free credit-reports. the affected residents whose financial account information and/or credit or debit card information was impacted are being advised to contact their financial institutions to inquire about steps to take to protect their accounts. the affected residents are also being provided with the contact information for the consumer reporting agencies and the federal trade commission.

front rush, llc (front rush) is writing to inform you about an incident that may have affected the privacy of some of your personal information. front rush provides athletics management software solutions to academic institutions and amateur athletics organizations (institutions). one or several of these institutions recruited you as a student athlete, or you may have been a member of one or more institutions, and some of your information was stored within front rush's systems due to the institutions' use of front rush.

on or around january 5, 2020, front rush was informed by a security researcher that one of its amazon web services s3 buckets (the s3 bucket) was publicly accessible from the internet. the s3 bucket contained certain attachments (like transcripts, injury reports, or athletic reports) that were placed in the platform by the institutions, and certain attachments that were uploaded by student-athletes, prospective student-athletes, or their parents/guardians, in response to prompts in a recruitment questionnaire formulated and disseminated by the institutions.

upon learning of this event, front rush immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the incident. the investigation determined that the s3 bucket was publicly accessible between january 18, 2016, and january 8, 2020. front rush's own internal database and systems were not affected by this incident. we also contacted the security researcher, who stated that he did not save or share any copies of the data. although we have no evidence to suggest that the s3 bucket was accessed by anyone other than the security researcher, logs were not sufficient to show whether anyone else had accessed the data.

out of an abundance of caution, we undertook a comprehensive programmatic and manual review of the entire contents of the s3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the s3 bucket and the individuals to whom it related. we received results of the data mining investigation on may 19, 2020, and began parsing the data to notify impacted institutions. the institutions were notified that your information was confirmed to be impacted on june 15, 2020.

although we do not have any evidence demonstrating that your information was accessed or acquired, our investigation determined the information present in the s3 bucket included your name and the following types of personal information: <<breached elements>>.

front rush takes this incident and the security of your personal information seriously. upon learning of this incident, front rush immediately took steps to reconfigure and secure the s3 bucket to ensure it was no longer publicly accessible, and launched an in-depth investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. front rush also notified its customer institutions and updated them as the investigation unfolded. as part of front rush's ongoing commitment to the privacy of personal information in its care, front rush also reviewed its existing policies and procedures to ensure the security of information in its systems. front rush will continue working to further secure the information in its systems going forward. front rush is also notifying state regulatory authorities, where required.

additional steps you can take
we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

equifax, po box 740241, atlanta, ga 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111

transunion, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:
fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit. how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam:

we represent front rush, llc (front rush), located at 1333 n. kingsbury street, fl 4, chicago il, 60642. front rush maintains data on behalf of certain data owners and is writing to notify your office, on its own behalf and their behalf, of an incident that may affect the privacy of personal information relating to seven hundred and thirty-five (735) iowa residents. front rush reserves the right to supplement this notice with new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. by providing this notice, front rush does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of iowa law, the applicability of the iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

nature of the data event

front rush provides athletics management software solutions to academic institutions and amateur athletics organizations (institutions). on january 5, 2020, front rush was informed by a security researcher that one of its amazon web services s3 buckets (the s3 bucket) was publicly accessible from the internet. the s3 bucket contained: (a) certain attachments (like transcripts, injury reports, or athletic reports) that were placed in the platform by the institutions; and (b) certain attachments that were uploaded by student-athletes, prospective student-athletes or their parents/guardians, in response to prompts in a recruitment questionnaire formulated and disseminated by the institutions.

upon learning of this event, front rush immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the incident. the investigation determined that the s3 bucket was likely publicly accessible between january 18, 2016 and january 8, 2020. the investigation also determined that front rush's own internal database and systems were unaffected by this incident. front rush also contacted the security researcher, who stated that he did not save or share any copies of the data. although front rush has no evidence to suggest that the s3 bucket was accessed by anyone other than the security researcher, logs were not sufficient to show whether anyone else had accessed the data. out of an abundance of caution, front rush undertook a comprehensive programmatic and manual review of the entire contents of the s3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the s3 bucket and the individuals to whom it related.

on january 10, 2020, front rush began notifying affected institutions that information relating to individuals may have been affected by this incident, based on information it had available at that time. once front rush completed the comprehensive review of the entire contents of the s3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the bucket and the individuals to whom it related, front rush notified the affected institutions, offered to provide notification services, and worked with institutions to confirm the contact information for these individuals. these notifications were sent to the institutions on june 15, 2020.

front rush offered the institutions the opportunity to opt out of notices and to provide supplemental or additional address information. the investigation determined that the following types of information related to iowa residents was accessible within the s3 bucket: social security number and other identification number. to date, the investigation has found no evidence of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this event.

notice to iowa residents

on or around july 27, 2020, front rush began providing written notice of this incident to potentially affected individuals. this includes approximately seven hundred and thirty-five (735) iowa residents whose personal information under iowa law may have been accessible. written notice to the individuals is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon learning of this event front rush immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the incident, as well as what data may potentially be affected. front rush provided notice to data owner institutions that had associated-individuals data potentially accessible through the publicly accessible s3 bucket. front rush is also offering complimentary access to twelve (12) months of credit and identity monitoring services, including identity restoration services, through transunion or equifax for individuals whose social security number or driver's license was potentially exposed, and the contact information for a dedicated call center for potentially affected individuals to contact with questions or concerns regarding this incident.

additionally, front rush is providing affected individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud. this guidance includes information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant about incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, the respective state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud. front rush will also be providing notice of this event to other regulators as may be required under applicable state law.

re: incident notification

dear attorney general macdonald:

i am writing to notify you of a data security incident on behalf of my client, otr leasing, llc. otr leasing is a buyer of late model used tractors, which they then lease and/or sell to owner-operators.

otr leasing recently concluded its investigation of a data security incident that involved unauthorized access to a limited number of employee email accounts. upon suspecting potential unauthorized access to the employees' email accounts, otr leasing immediately secured the email accounts and launched an investigation, with the assistance of an outside cybersecurity firm.

as part of the investigation, otr leasing conducted a comprehensive review of the emails and attachments in the email accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been involved in this incident. through the investigation, otr leasing determined that an unauthorized party accessed the employees' email accounts between the dates of january 14, 2020, and january 20, 2020. the investigation was unable to rule out the possibility that the unauthorized party may have been able to access emails and attachments in the accounts.

in an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments in the accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized person and on june 8, 2020, determined the name and one or more of: social security number and driver's license number of 28 new hampshire residents were contained in the emails and attachments in the account.

on july 28, 2020, otr leasing will mail notification letters via united states postal service firstclass mail to the new hampshire residents whose information may have been involved in this incident, in accordance with n.h. rev. stat. ann. 359-c:20. a copy of the notification letter is enclosed.

otr leasing is offering one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection service through kroll to the individuals whose social security number was in the accessed accounts. otr leasing has also established a dedicated call center where all individuals may obtain more information regarding the incident.

to help prevent something like this from happening again, otr leasing has reset all employee passwords, limited external email access, continued to educate users on how to identify and avoid malicious emails, and added additional authentication measures for remote email access.

please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

re: notice of data breach

emanate health (formerly citrus valley health partners) values the relationship we have with our current and former employees and understands the importance of protecting personal information. we are writing to inform you about a data breach involving one of our third-party vendors, paperlesspay corporation (paperlesspay), that involves your personal information. paperlesspay is a payroll processing company that we have contracted with to process and deliver electronic pay stubs and w-2 tax forms. this notice explains the incident, the measures that have been taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened?

we received notice from paperlesspay on march 20, 2020, informing us that an unauthorized person gained access to its computer server. paperlesspay learned of the incident on february 19, 2020, when the department of homeland security (dhs) contacted paperlesspay to inform them that an unknown person was purporting to sell access to the paperlesspay database on the dark web. in response, paperlesspay shut down its web server and structured query language (sql) server to prevent any potential unauthorized access. the server shutdown prevented you from accessing payroll records online for a period of time while the servers were offline.

over the following weeks, paperlesspay cooperated with a joint investigation conducted by dhs and the federal bureau of investigation (fbi), and paperlesspay retained a cybersecurity firm to help with its internal forensic investigation of the incident. the investigations confirmed that an unknown individual accessed paperlesspay's sql server where employee data is stored on february 18, 2020. the available evidence has not, however, allowed dhs, the fbi, or paperlesspay's cybersecurity firm to determine what data the individual may have accessed or viewed while connected to the sql server. it is possible the person only used the access to determine the size of the sql database and to stage it for subsequent access that could be sold to others, and that the individual did not directly access any employee data. however, the individual would have had the capability to run queries against the sql database and view its data, so paperlesspay cannot rule out the possibility of unauthorized access or acquisition of your personal information.

what information was involved?

the information stored in the sql server about employees consists of the data components that appear on their pay stubs and tax forms, including their name, address, pay and withholdings, last four digits of bank account number (if that information is included on the pay stubs), and social security number. these data components are stored on the sql server in different tables that are associated by user id numbers, not names, within each table. therefore, the only way to associate any data with an individual would be to run a query against the database and have it aggregate an individual's name with his or her other data components. paperlesspay could not conclusively determine whether such queries were run. no bank account passwords or access codes were stored on the sql server.

what is paperlesspay doing?

paperlesspay has indicated that it has acted to secure its network and prevent future incidents. in order to resume its services, paperlesspay has rebuilt an entirely new domain controller, a new web server, and a new sql server. paperlesspay has also indicated that it then restored database files to the new sql server from backups, assigned new ip addresses to all of the new servers, changed all passwords for users and administrators, implemented a setting that requires clients to change their passwords when they log in for the first time, and disabled all remote access capabilities to the new web server and sql server. paperlesspay further reported that it installed an endpoint detection and response application on the new servers and other endpoints within its network that has enabled paperlesspay to monitor all activity while paperlesspay completed its investigation of the incident.

for emanate health's part, we have been working with paperlesspay to obtain details of the incident and the affected accounts and to obtain assurances that information about our employees is safe. in order to provide you with information you can use to better protect against identity theft and fraud, emanate health is offering free credit monitoring services for 12 months. instructions for enrolling in the credit monitoring services, as well as additional information on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, are included in the attached privacy safeguards and last page of this letter.

what can you do?

you should review and follow the attached privacy safeguards for how to protect against identity theft and fraud. you can enroll to receive the free credit monitoring services by following the instructions listed on the last page of this letter.

for more information.

we understand that you may have questions that are not addressed in this notice. if you have additional questions or concerns, please call our toll-free assistance line at 855-907-2124, monday through friday, from 6 am to 6 pm pst. we regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any concern or inconvenience this may cause you.

i am writing to inform you of a data security incident experienced by good samaritan hospital (good sam) that may have involved your personal information and/or protected health information, described below. at good sam, we take the privacy and security of all information very seriously. while we have no evidence to suggest that any of the impacted information was viewed or misused during this compromise, it is crucial that we be as supportive and transparent as possible. that is why i am writing to inform you of this incident, to offer information about steps that can be taken to help protect your information, and to let you know about complimentary credit monitoring services that we are offering you through kroll, a global leader in risk mitigation and response. i sincerely apologize for any concern that this incident may cause you. let me reassure you that good sam is dedicated to providing the best care possible, and fully committed to supporting you.

what happened:
on november 4, 2019, good sam became aware of a potential compromise to several of its email accounts as a result of a targeted email phishing campaign that occurred over several days. during the course of this phishing campaign, good sam employees began receiving fraudulent emails that appeared to be from a known contact. these fraudulent emails contained a link to a malicious website that was designed to steal email account credentials. upon discovery, good sam swiftly blocked access to the malicious website. additionally, good sam immediately took steps to secure the affected accounts, which included resetting the passwords required to access the affected employee email accounts and implementing additional email and network security measures. further, good sam promptly began investigating the incident with the support of a third-party expert forensics firm. following progress by experts in their thorough investigation, it was ultimately determined that several employee email accounts experienced unauthorized access between october 28, 2019, and november 8, 2019, as a result of the above-referenced phishing campaign. upon confirmation of the unauthorized access to good sam employee email accounts, good sam's third-party forensic experts immediately investigated whether the affected email accounts contained individuals' sensitive information. on june 24, 2020, after continued thorough investigation, good sam learned that the unauthorized access may have enabled access to your personal information. the information potentially impacted was within the affected employee email accounts in the normal course and scope of business as a part of regular hospital operations. there is no evidence to suggest that any good sam employee acted maliciously. good sam has worked diligently to obtain sufficient contact information to provide affected individuals with this notification. while we have no reason to believe that any information within the affected email accounts was actually viewed or misused during this compromise, we are providing this notification to you out of an abundance of caution and so that you may diligently monitor your personal information and resources. we take great care in the security of our technology systems, and regret that this incident has occurred. this incident did not involve good sam information systems and is limited to the affected email accounts.

what information was involved:
it is important to note, as mentioned above, that there is no evidence to suggest that any personally identifiable information or personal health information has been viewed or misused. the personal information that could have been viewed by the unauthorized individual(s) may have included your first and last name, in combination with your date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, tax identification number, financial account number, treatment/diagnosis, health insurance information, billing information, doctor's name, medical record number, medical history, prescription information, medicare/medicaid id, and/or patient account number.

what we are doing:
good sam has taken every step necessary to address the incident and is committed to fully protecting all of the information that you have entrusted to us. unfortunately, phishing events have become more common and the phishing campaign experienced by good sam is similar to others experienced by other companies and industries. upon learning of this incident, we immediately secured the affected accounts and took steps to enhance the security of all information, including patient information, to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. we retained a third-party forensic firm to conduct a thorough investigation and are offering you complimentary credit monitoring services.

credit monitoring:
as a safeguard, we have arranged for you to activate, at no cost to you, an online credit monitoring service for	the breach was caused by a phishing campaign that led to unauthorized access of several employee email accounts between october 28, 2019, and november 8, 2019, as confirmed by a third-party expert forensics firm. the incident involved the compromise of email accounts due to hacking.

dear cwsl alumni,

we are writing to inform you, out of an abundance of caution, about a data security incident that may have involved your personal information.

what happened?

a third-party vendor, blackbaud, inc. (the company that stores our fundraising data and services thousands of non-profits globally) notified us of a ransomware attack on its hosting system. blackbaud informed us of the incident on july 16, 2020. our internal data storage systems were not affected by the security incident.

what information was involved?

according to blackbaud, the ransomware attack did not disclose any credit card data, bank account data, social security numbers, or other sensitive financial information, all of which was safely encrypted. blackbaud has not provided us with specific information yet about the type of client information accessed during the incident, but we have been working with their customer representatives and security personnel to get confirmation of the details. it is possible that contact information for some individuals may have been compromised, however, blackbaud believes it has prevented the dissemination of any data that was accessed.

what blackbaud is doing.

blackbaud has informed us there is no reason to believe that any data was or will be misused or will be further disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. blackbaud has hired a third-party team of experts to continue monitoring for any such activity.

as part of its ongoing efforts to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, blackbaud has affirmed that it has already implemented changes to protect its system from any subsequent incidents: they have identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and taken actions to fix it. they have also confirmed through testing by multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, that their fix withstands all known attack tactics.

what we are doing.

we take this event very seriously. we are deeply invested in the safety and well-being of our entire community, especially our community of members, donors, and volunteers like you. we are continuing to communicate with blackbaud and are working closely with our security and legal teams, and as we learn more about the security incident, we will provide you with updates.

what you can do.

in the meantime, we recommend as always to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity, phone calls, emails, or suspected identity theft to law enforcement and the appropriate service provider.

should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us by emailing tabatha abeyta, our director of philanthropy at tabeyta@cwsl.edu with the subject line blackbaud security.

we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

- equifax, po box 740241, atlanta, ga 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
- experian, po box 2002, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
- transunion, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

- federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

- experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
- transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
- equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

3. steps taken.

on june 5, 2020, the same day that ferris identified the malware infection on night owls retail website, ferris removed the infection and shut down public access to night owls retail website. during the following twenty days, ferris took steps to ensure the security of night owls website including the migration to a different hosting provider as well as the performance of upgrades to its network and software. night owls website reopened for public use on june 26, 2020. ferris has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. these steps include strengthening ferriss cybersecurity posture by implementing enhanced software monitoring programs and firewall protection to resist the future occurrence of any similar cybersecurity events. ferris has also gone to great lengths to identify and notify any individuals who were potentially impacted as result of this incident including the hiring of a third-party vendor to arrange for any potentially affected individuals in new jersey to receive credit monitoring and identify theft protection services for twelve (12) months.

after becoming aware of this incident, we took prompt action to secure the limited number of employees' individual email accounts to help ensure that the unauthorized person no longer had access. we also took additional steps to contain the situation, including engaging outside information security and technology experts to assist in our review and investigation of the incident.

as part of this investigation, our information security and technology experts were engaged to determine what, if any, information may have been able to be accessed. on june 11, 2020, we concluded our investigation and confirmed the individuals whose nonpublic personal information was affected by this incident. individuals will receive written notification of this incident postmarked no later than july 23, 2020. a copy of the template notice to individuals is being sent along with this letter.

after becoming aware of this incident, we took prompt action to secure the limited number of employees' individual email accounts to help ensure that the unauthorized person no longer had access. we also took additional steps to contain the situation, including engaging outside information security and technology experts to assist in our review and investigation of the incident. as part of this investigation, our information security and technology experts were engaged to determine what, if any, information may have been able to be accessed.

re: notification of data security incident

dear attorney general gordon j. macdonald:

be advised that the undersigned and this law firm have been retained to represent everything kitchens, llc ("everything kitchens") in connection with the data security incident described below. everything kitchens is located at 6820 w. kings street, springfield, mo 65802 and provides kitchenware and appliances to its customers.

on may 28, 2020, everything kitchens determined that criminal hackers executed a sophisticated cyber-attack on its computer systems which resulted in the attackers gaining access to the personal information of a small number of its customers who used debit or credit cards as a form of payment on may 28, 2020, including names, addresses, email address, telephone numbers, credit card numbers, credit card expiration dates, and credit card verification numbers. no social security numbers were compromised as a result of this attack.

prior to this incident, everything kitchens had implemented a sucuri edge-protection firewall on its public-facing site, in addition to its hosting provider, nexcess, having its own hardware firewall. everything kitchens' site runs on magento i and was regularly updated with the latest supee security patches from the vendor. the entire public-facing codebase of the magento i site was under strict source control, using monitored uncommitted files and git repository commits. in addition, the administrative side of everything kitchens' site had an .htauth server level password protection, on top of the administrative panel authorization, which was whitelisted to everything kitchens' corporate intellectual property.

upon learning of this incident, everything kitchens immediately began addressing the issue, using industry best practices and professionals who specialize in these matters. in particular, everything kitchens swiftly secured the server and cleaned up all malicious code, scanned the rest of the environment for malware as well as verified security patch compliance. everything kitchens then performed full forensics of the breach event and implemented multiple security layers to prevent further malicious activity.

since the incident, everything kitchens has reworked its .htauth server level password protection, removed all whitelists, installed recently released magento i supee, eliminated the ability for customer-expos, performed a full security audit and virus scan of the server, and is in the process of setting up i frame payments through braintree, so credit card track data cannot be compromised in transit.

everything kitchens notified one (1) new hampshire resident of this incident on july 8, 2020, via u.s. mail and has partnered with id experts, to make available at no cost to affected individuals its myidcare identity theft protection solution. the myidcare solution includes one year of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. a sample copy of the notice sent to the new hampshire resident is enclosed.

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam,

we represent front rush, llc ("front rush"), located at 1333 n. kingsbury street, fl 4, chicago il, 60642. front rush maintains data on behalf of certain data owners and is writing to notify your office, on its own behalf and their behalf, of an incident that may affect the privacy of personal information relating to one thousand, two hundred ninety-three (1,293) new hampshire residents. front rush reserves the right to supplement this notice with new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. by providing this notice, front rush does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of new hampshire law, the applicability of the new hampshire data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

nature of the data event

front rush provides athletics management software solutions to academic institutions and amateur athletics organizations ("institutions"). on january 5, 2020, front rush was informed by a security researcher that one of its amazon web services s3 buckets ("the s3 bucket") was publicly accessible from the internet. the s3 bucket contained: (a) certain attachments (like transcripts, injury reports, or athletic reports) that were placed in the platform by the institutions; and (b) certain attachments that were uploaded by student-athletes, prospective student-athletes or their parents/guardians, in response to prompts in a recruitment questionnaire formulated and disseminated by the institutions. upon learning of this event, front rush immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the incident. the investigation determined that the s3 bucket was likely publicly accessible between january 18, 2016, and january 8, 2020. the investigation also determined that front rush's own internal database and systems were unaffected by this incident. front rush also contacted the security researcher, who stated that he did not save or share any copies of the data. although front rush has no evidence to suggest that the s3 bucket was accessed by anyone other than the security researcher, logs were not sufficient to show whether anyone else had accessed the data. out of an abundance of caution, front rush undertook a comprehensive programmatic and manual review of the entire contents of the s3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the s3 bucket and the individuals to whom it related. on january 10, 2020, front rush began notifying affected institutions that information relating to individuals may have been affected by this incident, based on information it had available at that time. once front rush completed the comprehensive review of the entire contents of the s3 bucket to confirm the type of information contained in the bucket and the individuals to whom it related, front rush notified the affected institutions, offered to provide notification services, and worked with institutions to confirm the contact information for these individuals. these notifications were sent to the institutions on june 15, 2020.

front rush offered the institutions the opportunity to opt-out of notices and to provide supplemental or additional address information. the investigation determined that the following types of information related to new hampshire residents were accessible within the s3 bucket: social security number, driver's license number/state id number, other identification number, and financial account information. to date, the investigation has found no evidence of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this event.

notice to new hampshire residents

on or around july 27, 2020, front rush began providing written notice of this incident to potentially affected individuals. this includes approximately one thousand, two hundred ninety-three (1,293) new hampshire residents whose personal information under new hampshire law may have been accessible. written notice to the individuals is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon learning of this event, front rush immediately commenced an investigation, working with third-party forensic investigators, to assess the nature and scope of the incident, as well as what data may potentially be affected. front rush provided notice to data owner institutions that had associated-individuals' data potentially accessible through the publicly accessible s3 bucket. front rush is also offering complimentary access to twelve (12) months of credit and identity monitoring services, including identity restoration services, through transunion or equifax for individuals whose social security number or driver's license was potentially exposed, and the contact information for a dedicated call center for potentially affected individuals to contact with questions or concerns regarding this incident.

additionally, front rush is providing affected individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud. this guidance includes information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant about incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, the respective state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud. front rush will also be providing notice of this event to other regulators as may be required under applicable state law.

to whom it may concern,

i am writing to provide a supplemental notification of a recent data security incident suffered by good samaritan hospital ("good sam"). we previously notified your office of this incident on june 1, 2020.

on or around november 4, 2019, good sam became aware of a potential compromise to several of its email accounts as a result of a targeted email phishing campaign that occurred over several days. upon discovery, good sam immediately took steps to secure the affected accounts, which included resetting the passwords required to access the affected employee email accounts and implementing additional email and network security measures.

further, good sam promptly began investigating the incident, which included engaging a third-party expert forensics firm. it was ultimately determined, on february 18, 2020, that several email accounts experienced unauthorized access between october 22, 2019,	the breach was due to a targeted email phishing campaign resulting in unauthorized access to several employee email accounts that were later secured by the hospital.

the information involved included customer name, billing and mailing address, credit or debit card number, expiration date, and cvv.

what we are doing

what you can do

we recommend that you closely review the information provided in this letter for steps you can take to protect yourself against potential misuse of your credit and debit card information. remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. if you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect fraud, report it immediately, and notify your financial institution.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear christopher,

we are writing to inform you about a recent security incident. please click on the personalized link provided in this email for next steps and resources created specifically for your organization.

what happened:

the cybercrime industry is a constantly growing and changing threat to all companies worldwide. at blackbaud, our cyber security team successfully defends against millions of attacks each month and is constantly studying the landscape to ensure we stay ahead of this sophisticated criminal industry. in may 2020, we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. in a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. after discovering the attempted attack, our cyber security team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files, and ultimately expelled them from our system.

prior to our locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment. the cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. because protecting our customers' data was our top priority, we paid the cybercriminals' demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed.

based on the nature of the incident, our research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. in accordance with regulatory requirements and in an abundance of caution, we are notifying all organizations whose data was part of this incident and are providing resources and tools to help them assess this incident.

what this means for your organization specifically:

our public cloud environment (microsoft azure and amazon web services) and most of our self-hosted datacenters, products, and customers were not part of this incident, but we have confirmed the following specific to your organization:

a copy of your blackbaud etapestry backup was part of this incident. again, the file the cybercriminal removed a copy of did not contain any credit card information. further, the cybercriminal did not gain access to bank account information, usernames, passwords, or social security numbers stored in your database because they were encrypted. none of your data was lost or corrupted as a result of this incident. and again, based on the nature of the incident, our research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. we have hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web as an extra precautionary measure.

we have created a resource page for you at www.blackbaud.com/incidentresources that features a toolkit with a step-by-step guide to help you as you digest this information. it also contains answers to key questions, links to educational webinars (hosted by rich friedberg, blackbaud's chief information security officer and cameron stoll, our head of privacy), information about our future plans, and other resources.

it is unlikely but possible, depending on jurisdiction, that our customers may have to make further notifications to constituents or other third parties. your toolkit provides a written guide to notification laws and access to a webinar that helps you assess potential notification requirements in your jurisdictions. we advise you to also consult with your organization's legal counsel to understand any notification requirements. we want to continue to be your partner through this incident. if you determine that you do need to notify your constituents, we have included templates in your toolkit to make it easier.

to ensure all your questions are answered as quickly as possible, we encourage you to first review the resources we provided at the link above. if you still have questions after reviewing these resources, we are here to help. please contact the dedicated team we have established for this incident:

north and south america: 1-855-907-2099 between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. et monday - friday

we understand this situation is frustrating. this was a very sophisticated attack, and while we were able to defend against it for the most part, we realize this is still requiring that you invest time to review the situation, and that you may need to invest time to take follow-up actions. we apologize for this and will continue to do our very best to supply help and support as we and our customers jointly navigate any necessary response to the cybercriminals' actions.

sincerely,

todd lant
chief information officer	the breach was caused by a successful ransomware attack on blackbaud's self-hosted environment that happened in may 2020. the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data, which included a copy of etapestry backup of museum of contemporary art santa barbara.

fraud alert:

you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

security freeze:

under u.s. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. this will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. in order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

additional free resources:

you can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the ftc, or from your respective state attorney general about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. you may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the ftc or to the attorney general in your state.

nature of the security incident or unauthorized access

paperlesspay corporation (paperlesspay) recently notified doylestown of a security incident that it experienced. doylestown contracts with paperlesspay for the provision of online bi-weekly paystubs and w-2 tax forms. according, to paperlesspay, on february 19, 2020, the department of homeland security (dhs) contacted paperlesspay and notified it that someone was purporting to sell access to paperlesspay's client database on the dark web. paperlesspay shut down its web server and sql server to prevent unauthorized access. paperlesspay worked with the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) and retained a cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation. the investigation revealed that someone accessed paperlesspay's sql server on february 18, 2020. doylestown and paperlesspay worked together to obtain additional information concerning the incident, including what, if any information the threat-actor may have acquired.

at this point, doylestown is not aware of an unauthorized access or acquisition of its employees' personal information or that any of the information has been misused. however, paperlesspay could not definitely rule out the possibility that someone accessed or acquired doylestown employees' personal information. accordingly, doylestown is notifying the potentially impacted employees and arranged for complementary identity theft protection services for the employees.

doylestown determined that one (1) new hampshire resident may have been impacted by this incident. on august 4, 2020, doylestown notified the impacted individual of the situation by letter. enclosed is a copy of the notice that is being sent to the impacted individual.

contents of data breach notification letter: melanie flowers, privacy officer at benesys, inc., a michigan company, wrote a letter to attorney general gordon macdonald of new hampshire on august 6, 2020, to inform him of a security event pursuant to n.h. rev. stat. 359 c:20. benesys is the third-party administrator for employee benefit plans, including health benefit plans. on july 22, 2020, a file containing the personal information of multiple plan participants in a client's plan was accidentally sent to a participant through their encrypted secure email system. the error was discovered on july 27, 2020, when the participant first opened the file with the personal information and immediately alerted them to the error. the file included participants' first and last names, social security numbers, and bank account and routing numbers. one resident of new hampshire was included in the disclosure. they obtained a declaration from the recipient confirming that the file was permanently deleted and not further disseminated. because the trust is a covered entity under the health insurance privacy and protection act (hipaa), the event will be reported to the department of health and human services. they informed the client of the event on july 28, 2020, and all affected participants were sent a letter on july 31, 2020, explaining the event and steps they could take to protect their personal information. the letter also contained an offer of 24 months of no-cost credit monitoring service from experian. they are implementing additional training to reduce the risk of similar errors in the future. the letter also includes information on what affected individuals can do to protect their personal information and what benesys is doing to address the issue.	the file containing personal information was accidentally sent to a plan participant through their encrypted secure email system, which was immediately alerted to benesys, inc. because it was a mistake and not a result of hacking, insider activity, or physical loss, this breach falls under the unintended disclosure (disc) category.
contents of data breach notification letter: unable to extract pdf text or no pdf available	there is little to no information available to make a determination on the type of breach.
contents of data breach notification letter: blackbaud breach q&a for businesses, nonprofits, and legal counsel:

in mid-july, blackbaud, a software provider used by a significant portion of the nonprofit community, reported a ransomware attack that took place in may 2020 and resulted in the acquisition of data by cybercriminals. according to public statements, blackbaud claims that it has no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly, but, to date, has not announced any concrete substantiation of this claim. it is generally difficult to prove that a cybercriminal that has acquired sensitive data has deleted it, and absent affirmative proof, one should treat that data as acquired or breached under vermont's laws. the attorney general's office (ago) is encouraged by how quickly users of blackbaud's software have moved to ensure compliance with vermont and other states' security breach notice acts by issuing notices to their customers, donors, and others. this q&a attempts to address some issues that have arisen and provides suggestions based on information that is currently publicly available. the details of this incident, however, may develop over time.

what is considered a security breach? an incident is only considered a security breach if (i) the subset of data defined as personally identifiable information or pii is acquired, and (ii) that data is unencrypted. blackbaud's public statement is that no unencrypted credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers were acquired. while these are the most common types of pii implicated, vermont law also includes other data as pii: government identification numbers like driver's licenses and passports; health information, including health insurance policy numbers; genetic information; biometric information; and login credentials. the ago is not aware that blackbaud has commented on these data types. if a nonprofit has entered any pii, like a social security number, into an otherwise unencrypted field, like a freeform text field, that information should be assumed to have been acquired, resulting in a breach. a full explanation of vermont's security breach notice act can be found in this recently issued guidance.

is vermont's breach notice act the right state's law to comply with? organizations should comply with vermont's act with regard to all consumers affected by the breach who reside in vermont. if an organization must notify anyone outside of vermont, it must comply with the law of the state in which the consumer resides.

how should a blackbaud user respond to this incident? many organizations appear to be issuing notice without clarifying whether or not a consumer's pii was affected. while the ago appreciates the desire for transparency, notices like this, particularly coming from multiple sources as is occurring here, can create anxiety without providing needed clarity to consumers: if an organization knows with certainty that it has not stored any pii in a blackbaud system, or has only stored it in fields that blackbaud claims to be encrypted, then that organization has not experienced a security breach and has no obligation under vermont law to issue notice. if an organization is uncertain of this fact, and cannot confirm one way or the other, it should treat this as a security breach and follow the vermont security breach act notice guidance.

is a blackbaud user required to issue notice if no pii was breached? the ago understands that many organizations wish to be as open as possible with customers and donors and may want to issue notice even if no pii was affected. some information stored in the blackbaud database, like home values, income levels, or even personal preferences, is not considered pii but would still be the sort of information that many consumers would like to know has been accessed. if an organization is certain that a breach as defined by the law has not occurred (that is, unencrypted pii was not involved), but still wishes to issue notice, the ago encourages you to be as clear as possible. this may include the following elements, but, again, note that none of this is obligatory. explain that the customers, donors, or others may have heard about the blackbaud breach. state that, based on representations from blackbaud no pii was acquired, if applicable. if there are pieces of sensitive information that are not pii involved, you may want to disclose those. none of this is obligatory. we are recommending this to avoid notices that people may find confusing. include a warning that phishing scams often occur in the wake of a breach and that you will not call or email the consumer asking them for their login credentials, credit card number, or other financial information. furthermore, you do not accept payment in the form of gift cards and would never request them. if a notice of non-breach is being issued, the ago does not need to be informed of it. breach notices, as usual, must be sent to the ago, where they are posted on its website.

if you have any questions or are uncertain about anything in the guidance, please contact ago.securitybreach@vermont.gov or 802-828-5479.	the breach was a result of a ransomware attack by cybercriminals.
contents of data breach notification letter: what you can do: although the risk is low, due to the extent of the information disclosed, you should immediately notify your has been disclosed. in addition, we recommend that you closely monitor your bank and credit card accounts to ensure that no fraud occurs. we are offering you credit monitoring services through experian for two years at no cost to you. please contact our privacy team at (888) 879-7834 or corporate.compliance@benesys.com if you are interested in credit monitoring or if you have any questions.

what we are doing: our it department was able to retrieve and permanently delete the message and the file with your personal information from our secure email server so that the recipient cannot access it again. we have confirmed with the recipient that the file with your personal information was deleted and that the file has not been copied, forwarded or otherwise shared. since discovering the error, we have addressed the employee involved who sent the file and have taken steps to reduce the risk of similar incidents. we sincerely apologize for this error and understand the concern it may cause you. given the report and level of cooperation by the participant who received the file in error, we have no reason to believe that your information was further disclosed or compromised. the privacy and protection of the information to which we are entrusted is a top priority of benesys and the trust. should you have any questions or require more information, please contact us at (888) 879-7834 or corporate.compliance@benesys.com.

what you should do to protect your personal information: we recommend you remain vigilant and consider taking one or more of the following steps to protect your personal information:

1. contact the nationwide credit-reporting agencies as soon as possible to:

- add a fraud alert statement to your credit file at all three-national credit-reporting agencies: equifax, experian, and transunion. you only need to contact one of the three agencies listed below; your request will be shared with the other two agencies. this alert will remain on your credit file for 90 days. a fraud alert alerts credit or of possible fraudulent activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. once the fraud alert is added to your credit report, all creditors should contact you prior to establishing any account in your name.
- add a security freeze to your credit file. a security freeze prevents your credit account from being shared with potential creditors, which can help prevent new account identity theft. if you would like to request a security freeze be placed on your account, you must write by certified or overnight mail (see addresses below) to each of the three credit reporting agencies, or through the electronic or internet method made available by the credit reporting agencies. credit reporting agencies charge a $5 fee to place or remove a security freeze, unless you provide proof that you are a victim of identity theft, in which case there is no fee. a copy of a police report or an investigative report or written ftc complaint documenting identity theft must be included to avoid a fee. in your request, you also must include (documentation for both the spouse and the victim must be submitted when requesting for the spouse's credit report) (i) a copy of either the police report or case number documenting the identity theft, if you are a victim of identity theft; (ii) your full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.,) address, social security number, and date of birth; (iii) if you have moved in the past 5 years, the addresses where you have lived over the prior 5 years; (iv) proof of current address such as a current utility bill or phone bill; (v) a photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or id card, military identification, etc.); and, if applicable (vi) payment by check, money order or credit card (visa, master card, american express or discover cards only.)
- remove your name from mailing lists of pre-approved offers of credit for approximately six months.
- obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.annualcreditreport.com.

2. review all bills and credit card statements closely to determine whether you have been charged for items you did not contract for or purchase. review all of your bank account statements frequently for checks, purchases, or deductions not made by you. note that even if you do not find suspicious activity initially, you should continue to check this information periodically since identity thieves sometimes delay their use of stolen personal information.

3. the federal trade commission (ftc) offers consumer assistance and educational materials relating to identity theft, privacy issues, and how to avoid identity theft. you can also obtain information from the ftc about fraud alerts and security freezes. you may contact the ftc by visiting www.ftc.gov or www.consumer.gov/idtheft, calling (877) 438-4338, or writing to the ftc at the address below. if you suspect or know that you are the victim of identity theft, you should contact local police. you can also report such activity to the fraud department of the ftc, which will collect all relevant information and make it available to law-enforcement agencies. the mailing address for the ftc is: federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw washington, dc 20580. you may also obtain information about fraud alerts and security freezes from your state attorney general and the credit reporting agencies.

4. we also recommend you closely monitor your financial accounts and access resources concerning identity theft, such as information the internal revenue services has published at: http://www.irs.gov/individuals/identity-protection and https://www.irs.gov/uac/taxpayer-guide-to-identity-theft. as discussed in the taxpayer guide to identity theft, irs form 14039 can be filed with the irs to report potential identity theft concerning your federal taxes. you also may want to check with the state(s) in which you file.

experian identity works extendcaretm: you receive the same high-level of identity restoration support even after your experian identityworks membership has expired. up to $1 million identity theft insurance: provides coverage for certain costs and unauthorized electronic fund transfers. if you believe there was fraudulent use of your information and would like to discuss how you may be able to resolve those issues, please reach out to an experian agent at 1-877-890-9332. if, after discussing your situation with an agent, it is determined that identity restoration support is needed, then an experian identity restoration agent is available to work with you to investigate and resolve each incident of fraud that occurred (including, as appropriate, helping you with contacting credit grantors to dispute charges and close accounts; assisting you in placing a freeze on your credit file with the three major credit bureaus; and assisting you with contacting government agencies to help restore your identity to its proper condition). please note that this identity restoration support is available to you for two years from the date of this letter and does not require any action on your part at this time. the terms and conditions for this offer are located at www.experianidworks.com/restoration. you will also find self-help tips and information about identity protection at this site.

dear [recipient],

on june 8, 2020, the connection concluded our investigation of an incident that involved unauthorized access to two of our employees' email accounts. the connection first learned of this incident on february 13, 2020, when an employee reported experiencing issues receiving email. upon learning of this, we immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of an outside professional it security firm.

through our investigation, we learned that unauthorized parties accessed two employees' email accounts between january 4, 2020, and february 13, 2020. the unauthorized parties also attempted to change the connection employees' direct deposit information with our payroll department. although it appears that the purpose of the unauthorized access to the accounts was to change the employees' direct deposit information and fraudulently obtain funds from the connection, we could not rule out the possibility that unauthorized parties may have been able to access emails and attachments in the accounts.

as part of our investigation, we conducted a comprehensive review of the emails and attachments in the email accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized parties as a result of this incident. through this review, we determined that the unauthorized parties may have accessed emails and attachments that contain your name in combination with your social security number and affiliation with the connection.

to date, we are unaware of any misuse of the information maintained in the two employees' email accounts. however, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously.

my firm represents st. john's preparatory school, an all-boys catholic preparatory school for grades 6 through 12 located in danvers, massachusetts (st. john's prep). pursuant to n .h. rev. stat. 359-c:20 , i am writing to notify you of a data breach involving the personal information of twenty-five new hampshire residents.

on thursday, july 16, 2020, st. john's prep was notified by blackbaud inc., a third-party software company that st. john's prep and many other schools and non-profit organizations use as a database for advancement operations and financial accounting information, of a security breach involving accounts at blackbaud. according to blackbaud, in may 2020, blackbaud discovered that cybercriminals had accessed their system and executed a ransomware attack. blackbaud's investigation showed that the cybercriminals copied and exfiltrated certain data from blackbaud's self-hosted environment before the hackers were locked out of the system. the hackers may have had access as early as february 7, 2020.

blackbaud has informed st john's prep that its investigation showed that the cybercriminals were ultimately expelled from blackbaud's system on or about may 20, 2020. we do not know why it took blackbaud from may 20, 2020 until july 16, 2020 to inform us about the incident.

blackbaud shared the following additional details regarding the data breach:

in may of 2020, we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. in a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. after discovering the attack, our cyber security team-together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement-successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from our system. prior to our locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment.

the cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. because protecting our customers' data was our top priority, we paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed. based on the nature of the incident, our research, and third party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

blackbaud informed st. john's prep that a legacy st. john's prep backup file from august 2019, stored by a blackbaud vendor and kept according to blackbaud policies, had been compromised. blackbaud assured st. john's prep that the database containing credit card, bank account, user names, passwords and social security numbers were encrypted, and thus that information could not have been accessed by the cybercriminals.

a few weeks before st. john's prep was notified of the blackbaud breach, it had discovered that a small subset of individuals had social security or credit card numbers that had been inadvertently entered into an unencrypted "notes" field in its blackbaud database. st. john's prep deleted these inadvertent entries at that time. once it learned of the blackbaud breach, st. john's prep determined from blackbaud that the backup database that may have been accessed by the hackers predated st. john's prep's attempt to remove the social security numbers and credit card numbers inadvertently stored in unencrypted fields in the database. consequently, st. john's prep is formally notifying and offering credit monitoring to those new hampshire individuals whose social security numbers were in these unencrypted fields in the backup database exposed during the breach.

in addition to these twenty-five individuals in new hampshire who we are formally notifying pursuant to n.h. rev. stat. 359-c:20, there were approximately 1,920 additional new hampshire individuals in the database whose data did not include personal information. while st. john's prep is not required to provide formal notification to these individuals pursuant to n.h. rev. stat. 359-c:20, in the interests of transparency and to keep its community informed of the incident, st. john's prep did send an email to everyone in the database for whom they have email addresses informing them of the breach on july 23, 2020. for these individuals, the information potentially impacted	the breach involved a ransomware attack by cybercriminals who copied and exfiltrated certain data from blackbaud's system before being locked out, and a backup database from a third-party vendor was compromised. the cybercriminals did not access credit card information, bank account information or social security numbers, but a small subset of individuals had social security or credit card numbers that had been inadvertently entered into an unencrypted "notes" field in the database.

re: incident notification

dear attorney general macdonald:

we are writing on behalf of our client, peabody properties, inc. ("peabody"), to notify you of a security incident. peabody is located in braintree, massachusetts.

peabody recently completed an investigation involving unauthorized access to several employees' email accounts. upon first learning of the incident, peabody secured the employees' email accounts, launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident, and a computer security firm was engaged to assist.

the investigation determined that an unauthorized person may have had access to the contents of the employees' email account at times between november 14, 2019, and january 14, 2020. the investigation could not definitively determine whether the unauthorized individual actually viewed or accessed any of the emails in the accounts; however, peabody was not able to rule out that possibility.

peabody searched the contents of the accounts to identify documents containing personal information. on may 18, 2020, peabody determined that an email or attachment in the accounts contained the names, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, limited health information, and/or financial account numbers of 54 new hampshire residents.

beginning today, peabody is providing notice via postal mail to the potentially affected new hampshire residents in accordance with n.h. rev. stat. ann. 359-c:20.1. a copy of the notification letter is enclosed. peabody has offered the potentially affected new hampshire residents whose social security numbers and/or driver's license numbers were involved in the incident a complimentary one-year membership in credit monitoring services through experian. peabody has also established a dedicated call center for individuals to	the breach was due to unauthorized access to several employees' email accounts, and it could not be determined definitively whether unauthorized individuals accessed any of the emails or not. personal information, including social security numbers, driver's license numbers, limited health information, and financial account numbers of 54 residents, were found in the accounts.

contents of data breach notification letter: northwest alumni and friends,

we are writing to inform you about a data security incident involving blackbaud, inc., a service provider of the northwest foundation. as you may be aware, blackbaud, an engagement and fundraising software service provider, recently experienced a data breach. northwest foundation is one of many schools and non-profits that have been affected. the foundation takes our relationship with you and our data protection responsibilities very seriously. please be assured that we do not store social security numbers or bank account numbers and that type of information was not accessed by the cybercriminal. blackbaud also assured us that the file accessed by the cybercriminal did not contain any credit card information and that they use encryption to store any financial account information. further details are below, including steps we have taken in response.

what happened

on july 16, 2020, we were contacted by blackbaud, one of the world's largest providers of customer relationship management systems for not-for-profit organizations and the higher education sector. company representatives informed us that a blackbaud service provider had been the victim of a ransomware attack that culminated in may 2020. the cybercriminal was unsuccessful in blocking access to the database involved in the attack, however, the cybercriminal was able to remove a copy of a subset of data from several of blackbaud's clients including data of northwest foundation.

what information was involved

we would like to reassure our constituents that a detailed forensic investigation was undertaken, on behalf of blackbaud, by law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity experts. as noted above, blackbaud has confirmed that the investigation found that the cybercriminal did not access your credit or debit card information, bank account information, or social security number because that information was stored in an encrypted format. also note that northwest foundation does not store social security numbers or bank account information. the northwest foundation data accessed by the cybercriminal in the blackbaud database may have contained some of the following information in some of the data records:

- public information such as name, title, date of birth, spouse
- addresses and contact details such as phone numbers and e-mail addresses
- philanthropic interests, giving capacity, and giving history to the northwest foundation
- educational attainment

the student records of northwest missouri state university were not involved in this incident.

what blackbaud is doing

we have been informed by blackbaud that in order to protect constituent data of blackbaud clients like northwest foundation and mitigate potential identity theft, it met the cybercriminal's ransomware demand. blackbaud has advised us that it has received assurances from the cybercriminal and third-party experts that the data was destroyed and thus is no longer usable or accessible by any unauthorized persons or entities. blackbaud informs us that it continues to monitor the web in an effort to verify the data accessed by the cybercriminal has not been misused.

steps we have taken in response

upon notification of this breach by blackbaud, we immediately launched our investigation and have taken the following steps:

- we are notifying affected alumni and friends to make them aware of this breach of blackbaud's systems;
- we are working with blackbaud to understand why there was a delay between it finding the breach and notifying us, as well as what actions blackbaud is taking to increase its security;
- we are conferring with other blackbaud clients to share information about this breach, resulting corrective actions, and identify any additional recommended best practices.

additional notifications regarding this incident will be posted to https://www.nwmissouri.edu/alumni/blackbaud.htm.

what you can do

we do not believe there is a need for our constituents to take any action at this time. although there is currently no evidence that your information has been misused, as a best practice, we recommend people remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious account activity or suspected identity theft to the proper authorities.

for questions related to the security incident, contact lori steiner, northwest foundation chief finance officer, 660-562-1411, foundation@nwmissouri.edu. we will continue to work with blackbaud to investigate this incident. we regret the inconvenience that this data breach may have caused and share your frustration. please be assured that we take data protection very seriously and are grateful for the continued support of our alumni and friends.

re: notice of data breach

dear name:

we are writing to inform you about an incident involving your personal information. on july 24, 2020, metlife mistakenly sent an email containing a report to a benefits department at a company where you have never worked. this report included some of your personal information. the recipient forwarded the report to one of their benefits consultants, who immediately notified metlife of the issue on july 27, 2020. the recipient employer and consultant confirmed that they have not shared the information and have fully deleted it. we do not believe your information is at risk since these parties promptly addressed this matter and are accustomed to handling sensitive data. we apologize for this error.

the inadvertently disclosed report contained your name, social security number, and premium refund information for metlife insurance coverage.

we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online three-bureau credit monitoring service (mytrueidentity) for one year. the service is provided by transunion interactive, a subsidiary of transunion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.

privacy laws do not allow us to register you directly to the monitoring service. to enroll in this service, go to the mytrueidentity website at www.mytrueidentity.com and in the space referenced as enter activation code, enter the following 12-letter activation code: <<insert unique 12-letter activation code>> and follow the three steps to receive access to the credit monitoring service online within minutes.

if you do not have access to the internet, you may enroll in a similar offline paper-based credit monitoring service via u.s. mail delivery, by calling the transunion fraud response services toll-free hotline at 1-855-288-5422, and when prompted, enter this code: 696518 and follow the steps to enroll in the offline credit monitoring service.

you may also add an initial fraud alert to your credit file or speak to a transunion representative if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft. you can sign up for the online or offline credit monitoring service anytime within the next 90 days. please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with transunion, experian, or equifax, or an address in the united states or its territories, and a valid social security number. enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain one year of unlimited access to your transunion credit report and credit score. the daily three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at transunion, experian, or equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, changes of address, and more. the service also includes access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

you should also consider placing a "fraud alert" or "security alert" on your credit file. an alert helps warn creditors checking your file that recent fraudulent activity may have occurred or may occur in the future. a potential creditor would then know to contact you before opening any new accounts. to place a fraud alert, contact the credit reporting agencies directly:

www.transunion.com

when you place any type of fraud alert on your credit file, the credit reporting agencies will send you a free copy of your credit report. look for accounts that are not yours, debts you do not owe, or any other inaccuracies (e.g., wrong social security number or home address). if you find an error, contact the credit reporting agency directly. by law, that credit reporting agency must investigate and respond.

you should also monitor your financial statements for unauthorized activity. to learn more about identity theft, visit the federal trade commission's your national resource about identity theft guidance materials at www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

we determined that this is an isolated incident. you can rest assured that we take this situation seriously and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again. this notification was not delayed due to a law enforcement investigation. we at metlife remain committed to doing everything we can to protect your privacy.

3. consider placing a security freeze on your credit file
if you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a security freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. a security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. you may place a security freeze on your credit report by sending a request in writing or by mail, to all three nationwide credit reporting companies. to find out more about how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information:
- equifax security freeze: [website], [phone number]
- experian security freeze: [website], [phone number]
- transunion security freeze: [website], [phone number]

in order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit monitoring company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze. if your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account, or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the city in which you currently reside.

if you do place a security freeze prior to enrolling in the credit monitoring service as described above, you will need to remove the freeze to sign up for the credit monitoring service. after you sign up for the credit monitoring service, you may refreeze your credit file.

4. obtaining a free credit report
under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. verify all information is correct. if you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

5. additional helpful resources
even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the federal trade commission (ftc) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems	the breach was due to a phishing incident which allowed an unauthorized party access to employee email accounts for a period between january 22, 2020, and february 4, 2020. personal information in some email accounts was discovered by the company on july 22, 2020.

re: incident notification

dear attorney general macdonald:

we are writing on behalf of our client, vermont public radio ("vpr"), to notify you of a security incident involving one new hampshire resident.

on july 16, 2020, vpr was notified by blackbaud of a ransomware attack on blackbaud's network that the company discovered in may of 2020. blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince blackbaud to pay a ransom. blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

upon learning of the incident from blackbaud, vpr conducted its own investigation of the blackbaud services it uses and the information provided by blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. on july 29, 2020, vpr determined that the backup file contained images of checks payable to vpr with the name and account number of one new hampshire resident.

beginning today, vpr is providing written notice via united states postal service first-class mail to this new hampshire resident pursuant to n.h. rev. stat. ann. 359-c:20, in the same form as the enclosed letter.

blackbaud has informed vpr that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

vpr has implemented additional check imaging procedures to redact account number from check images.

please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

pursuant to n.h. rev. stat. 359-c:19, et seq., the latin school of chicago, 59 w. north blvd., chicago, il 60610 ("latin"), through its attorneys michael best & friedrich, llp, 1 s. pinckney st., ste. 700, madison, wi 53703 ("mbf"), is writing to notify you about a data security incident that occurred at blackbaud, one of latin's third party service providers. latin is a private k-12 school located in chicago, illinois. it engages blackbaud for various cloud services to help manage its philanthropy, alumni engagement, student billing, and internal fund management. michael szczepanek, chief financial officer, mszczepanek@latinschool.org, (312) 582-6102, is latin's contact, and adrienne s. ehrhardt, partner, asehrhardt@michaelbest.com, (608) 283-0131, from mbf is latin's legal counsel, assisting with the management of this incident. we believe that four (4) new hampshire residents were among this group affected by this breach. latin is providing these residents with 12 months of free credit monitoring and id theft restoration through transunion.

on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified latin that it suffered a ransomware attack in may 2020, which blackbaud successfully stopped with the help of independent forensics experts and law enforcement. unfortunately, the perpetrator was able to copy backups that contained data from latin and many other schools, colleges, and nonprofits. blackbaud did, however, pay the requested ransom to ensure the backup file was permanently destroyed. the personal information that may have been accessed included: names, addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, and information relating to the individual's relationship with latin, such as their philanthropic giving history. blackbaud generally encrypts sensitive information such as social security number, credit card numbers, or financial account information entered on its systems. however, latin later discovered that blackbaud does not encrypt uploaded forms to its systems that may contain such information, and it subsequently determined that some forms containing social security numbers were uploaded to blackbaud's systems. blackbaud has informed latin that there is no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal; was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

re: legal notice of information security incident

sir or madam:

i am writing to notify your office of a security incident involving 34 new hampshire residents. the university of florida health (uf health) has learned of a security incident involving one of its software-based products to maintain lists. on july 16, 2020, uf health received notification from blackbaud that they had discovered a cyberattack on one of their systems that stores information. the cyberattack occurred at some point beginning on february 7, 2020, and could have been in there intermittently until may 20, 2020, when it was first discovered by blackbaud.

once it discovered the attack, blackbaud worked with law enforcement and an external investigator to research the incident. the cybercriminal demanded a ransom in exchange for an assurance that they would destroy the stolen data. blackbaud paid the ransom and received confirmation that the data the cybercriminal removed from the blackbaud system had been destroyed. blackbaud has not disclosed the details about how the data were destroyed and what confirmation was received. blackbaud has, however, shared that, based on their research and third-party (including both law enforcement and forensic security firms) investigations, they have no reason to believe that any data was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made publicly available.

uf does not use this system to store highly sensitive personal or clinical information. our research into this incident has revealed that some personal information, including demographic information (such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses) was included. additionally, dates of birth	the breach was a result of a cyberattack on a software-based product and the theft of personal information, indicating an outside party was responsible for the breach.

re: notice of data breach

dear [salutation]:

we are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. the prostate cancer foundation takes the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. we are therefore contacting you to explain the incident and provide you with steps you can take to protect yourself.

what happened

we were recently notified by one of our third-party service providers of a security incident. at this time, we understand they discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. after discovering the attack, the service provider's cyber security team together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking their system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from their system.

prior to locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of our backup file containing your personal information. this occurred at some point beginning on february 7, 2020, and could have been in there intermittently until may 20, 2020.

what information was involved

it's important to note that the cybercriminal did not access your credit card information, bank account information, or social security number. however, we have determined that the file removed may have contained your first and last name; contact information; email address; demographic information; a history of your relationship with our organization, such as donation dates and amounts; and information that you provided regarding a connection to prostate cancer.

because protecting customers' data is their top priority, our third-party service provider paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy of our back-up file which the cybercriminal removed had been destroyed. based on the nature of the incident, our vendor's research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, our vendor does not believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

what we are doing

notwithstanding our belief that the data breach was contained by our vendor, we are notifying you so that you can take action to protect yourself. ensuring the safety of our constituents' data is of the utmost importance to us. as part of their ongoing efforts to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, the prostate cancer foundation is reevaluating all third-party relationships which involve constituents' data and its internal data protection practices.

the prostate cancer foundation wants to know procedures are in place to protect your data from any subsequent incidents. with respect to this incident, the affected third-party vendor assures us that they have identified and corrected the vulnerability exploited by the cybercriminal.

what you can do

based on the information provided by our third-party vendor and our data collection practices, we do not believe your financial account, social security number, tax identification number, driver's license number, or credit card information or other information likely to lead to identity theft has been compromised. as a best practice, however, we recommend you remain vigilant, review your accounts, change your passwords and pins routinely, and periodically obtain a credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting agencies.

dear attorney general becerra:

filters fast, llc (filtersfast), a client of bryan cave leighton paisner, llp, is notifying the office of the attorney general that filtersfast is notifying approximately 26,093 individuals who reside in california of a criminal cyber-attack on the filtersfast website. this letter is being provided as a courtesy as we do not believe notification to you is required by your states statute.

in late february 2020, filtersfast was made aware of a possible data security incident affecting its e-commerce website. filtersfast immediately began investigating the potential issue. the investigation included hiring an outside expert forensics firm to analyze the filtersfast systems and determine if there was a breach of security. on july 20, 2020, that investigation revealed that attackers had succeeded in adding malicious code to the filtersfast website on july 15, 2019, which allowed unauthorized individuals to capture certain information during the checkout process. the malicious code was removed on july 10, 2020, during an unrelated update of the website, ending the unauthorized access.

the information potentially affected includes customer name, shipping and billing address, and payment card information used to make a purchase on the e-commerce site. filtersfast is mailing notifications to all potentially affected customers in your state between august 14 and august 18, 2020. an example of the notification is attached.

while it is unlikely that this event will result in new account creation identity theft, filtersfast is offering each potentially affected customer a one-year subscription to identity theft protection services through id experts, focused on identifying or remediating existing account fraud that might impact payment card accounts involved. services include 12 months of credit and cybserscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. information regarding these services, as well as additional information to assist customers, is included in the notification sent to the customer.

if you would like additional information concerning the above, please feel free to contact me.

sincerely,

joshua james	the information captured, including payment card information, was accomplished through the use of malicious code added to the website by unauthorized individuals.

notice of data breach

dear ivan ramrirez,

metropolitan community college of kansas city (mcckc) takes seriously the privacy and security of its students and employees, and therefore wanted to timely release information regarding a data privacy incident involving name, social security number, drivers license number, medical information and bank account information. although we are not aware of any misuse of individual information, it is important to us that we provide information regarding this matter.

what happened?

on june 19, 2020, mcckc determined that your information may have been available to an unauthorized party due to a ransomware attack that resulted in certain data being encrypted. following the incident, mcckc immediately engaged a third party to conduct a forensic investigation with the objective of identifying the potential scope of access the threat actor may have had to the environment during the period of unauthorized access, which included arriving at a determination as to whether sensitive personal data was accessed by an unauthorized third party. the forensic investigation was recently completed and determined that an unauthorized individual may have had access to the mcckc environment. the forensic investigation did not conclude or preclude that data was extracted from mcckcs systems however, it is possible that certain personal data, including names, social security numbers, drivers license information and medical information of former, prospective, and current students could have been accessed by an unauthorized party. the investigation further acknowledged that the names, social security numbers and bank account information of employees could have been accessible as well, however, there is no evidence that any personal information was extracted from mccs systems or subject to actual or attempted misuse. although the investigation did not find any specific access to any individuals information and mcckc has no indication that data has been extracted from mcckcs systems or misused, we have chosen to notify all potentially impacted parties of this incident out of an abundance of caution and in full transparency.

what we are doing?

following confirmation that an unauthorized individual did gain access to the mcckc network, mcckc immediately sought to identify the population of potentially impacted individuals. privacy of data is a top priority for mcckc and due to our security posture, mcckc did not lose access to its systems, backup systems, or other operational data. however, in an abundance of caution, mcckc has implemented additional safeguards to further secure system information. as a precaution, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (mytrueidentity) for one year provided by transunion interactive, a subsidiary of transunion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. this service includes credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration.

dear attorney general miller:

filters fast, llc (filtersfast), a client of bryan cave leighton paisner, llp, is notifying the office of the attorney general that filtersfast is notifying approximately 3,272 individuals who reside in iowa of a criminal cyber-attack on the filtersfast website. this letter is being provided as a courtesy as we do not believe notification to you is required by your state's statute.

in late february 2020, filtersfast was made aware of a possible data security incident affecting its e-commerce website. filtersfast immediately began investigating the potential issue. the investigation included hiring an outside expert forensics firm to analyze the filtersfast systems and determine if there was a breach of security. on july 20, 2020, that investigation revealed that attackers had succeeded in adding malicious code to the filtersfast website on july 15, 2019, which allowed unauthorized individuals to capture certain information during the checkout process. the malicious code was removed on july 10, 2020, during an unrelated update of the website, ending the unauthorized access.

the information potentially affected includes customer name, shipping and billing address, and payment card information used to make a purchase on the e-commerce site. filtersfast is mailing notifications to all potentially affected customers in your state between august 14 and august 18, 2020. an example of the notification is attached.

while it is unlikely that this event will result in new account creation identity theft, filtersfast is offering each potentially affected customer a one-year subscription to identity theft protection services through id experts, focused on identifying or remediating existing account fraud that might impact payment card accounts involved. services include 12 months of credit and cybserscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. information regarding these services, as well as additional information to assist customers, is included in the notification sent to the customer.

if you would like additional information concerning the above, please feel free to contact me.

pursuant to n.h. rev. stat. 359-c:19, et seq., the latin school of chicago, 59 w. north blvd., chicago, il 60610 ("latin"), through its attorneys michael best & friedrich, llp, 1 s. pinckney st., ste. 700, madison, wi 53703 ("mbf"), is writing to notify you about a data security incident that occurred at blackbaud, one of latin's third party service providers.

latin is a private k-12 school located in chicago, illinois. it engages blackbaud for various cloud services to help manage its philanthropy, alumni engagement, student billing, and internal fund management. michael szczepanek, chief financial officer, mszczepanek@latinschool.org, (312) 582-6102, is latin's contact, and adrienne s. ehrhardt, partner, asehrhardt@michaelbest.com, (608) 283-0131, from mbf is latin's legal counsel, assisting with the management of this incident.

we believe that four (4) new hampshire residents were among this group affected by this breach. latin is providing these residents with 12 months of free credit monitoring and id theft restoration through transunion.

on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified latin that it suffered a ransomware attack in may 2020, which blackbaud successfully stopped with the help of independent forensics experts and law enforcement. unfortunately, the perpetrator was able to copy backups that contained data from latin and many other schools, colleges, and nonprofits. blackbaud did, however, pay the requested ransom to ensure the backup file was permanently destroyed.

the personal information that may have been accessed included: names, addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, and information relating to the individual's relationship with latin, such as their philanthropic giving history. blackbaud generally encrypts sensitive information such as social security number, credit card numbers, or financial account information entered on its systems. however, latin later discovered that blackbaud does not encrypt uploaded forms to its systems that may contain such information, and it subsequently determined that some forms containing social security numbers were uploaded to blackbaud's systems.

blackbaud has informed latin that there is no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal; was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

blackbaud is working with third party cybersecurity experts and law enforcement to monitor the internet to assist in determining that the information relating to this incident was destroyed. it identified the vulnerability associated with this incident and quickly implemented a security fix. blackbaud has confirmed through testing by multiple third parties that their fix is able to withstand all currently known cyberattacks. as part of its ongoing efforts to help prevent an incident like this in the future, blackbaud has implemented additional safety protocols that will help to protect its data. additionally, blackbaud is accelerating efforts to enhance access management, backups, encryption, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

attached is a copy of the notification letters that latin will place in the u.s. mail tuesday, august 18, 2020, to the affected individuals. there was no delay in providing individual notification as a result of law enforcement investigation.

nature of the data event

patriot is an insurance services firm that acquired voluntary benefit specialists, llc ("vbs") in january of 2019. vbs is a voluntary employee benefits consulting and brokerage firm for employers. in connection with providing these services, vbs receives certain personal information from employers in order to enroll employees in voluntary benefit plans being offered by the employer.

on january 7, 2020, vbs discovered suspicious activity in a vbs employee's email account. vbs immediately took steps to secure the employee's email account and launched an investigation. this investigation included working with a third-party forensic investigator to determine the nature and scope of the activity.

on january 17, 2020, vbs' investigation determined that two (2) vbs employee email accounts had their account credentials used by an unknown actor(s) to gain unauthorized access to each of the accounts. although the investigation confirmed the unauthorized actor(s) gained access on separate occasions to one account between december 23, 2019, and january 13, 2020, and the second account between january 6, 2020, and january 7, 2020, vbs cannot rule out the possibility of the unauthorized actor(s) gaining access to any specific email or attachment in the affected accounts.

with the assistance of third-party forensics, on march 4, 2020, vbs completed a programmatic and manual review of the contents of the email accounts to determine the types of protected information contained in the emails and to which individuals the information relates, and immediately launched a review of its files to ascertain address information for the clients of the impacted individuals.

the information that could have been subject to unauthorized access includes name, date of birth, social security number, medical information, and/or insurance information.

on or about may 26, 2020, vbs notified each impacted client of this incident and is providing notice to impacted individuals on its clients' behalf.

upon discovering the event, patriot and vbs moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, including resetting the affected email account passwords, assessing the security of vbs' systems, and notifying potentially affected clients and individuals. patriot is also working to implement additional safeguards and training to its employees, including vbs employees.

while patriot and vbs are not aware of any attempted or actual misuse of personal information, it is providing impacted individuals with access to credit monitoring and identity restoration services for twelve (12) months, through transunion, at no cost to these individuals. additionally, vbs is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

re: notice of data security incident

to the new hampshire office of the attorney general:

we represent first pacific advisors, lp (fpa) and write to notify you about an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to two new hampshire residents, as further described below.

fpa is a los angeles-based investment adviser registered with the securities and exchange commission located at 11601 wilshire blvd, los angeles, ca 90025. we write to inform you of the nature of the incident and to explain the steps that fpa is taking to address the incident, including notifying potentially impacted individuals and identifying ways to help them protect their personal information.

nature of the incident

fpa recently determined that two employee email accounts were temporarily accessed by an unauthorized third party who sent a phishing email that impersonated a company service provider. upon learning of the situation, fpa promptly contained the incident by securing the email accounts, immediately took remedial actions and launched an investigation with the assistance of an independent expert computer forensics firm. the investigation determined that between may 2, 2020 and may 5, 2020, the two email accounts were accessed by a third party without authorization.

after performing a thorough review to determine who and what information was affected and completing the investigation on or around july 21, 2020, we concluded that the incident did not extend beyond the two email accounts. as part of the investigation, it was concluded that one or more of the following types of personal information were present in the two affected email accounts at the time of the incident: name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security number, and employee health insurance information.

there is no evidence that the unauthorized third party viewed the personal information. however, as a precaution, we are nonetheless notifying this office and the individual state residents, including providing them with complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for 24 months.

residents notified

fpa has identified those affected individuals who are residents in your state and the personal information of such residents that was present in the two email accounts, and fpa intends to provide notice of the incident to two new hampshire residents on or about august 20, 2020. an unaddressed copy of the individual notification letter is attached.

steps taken relating to the incident

after learning about the incident, fpa quickly took steps to confirm the security of its systems, including all of its employee email accounts. fpa immediately reset the passwords for the affected email accounts, and required all other employees not affected by the incident to reset their passwords. fpa has been implementing additional safeguards designed to protect its network and has increased the intensity of its phishing testing, including targeted training. fpa also contacted federal and state authorities.

in addition, fpa is providing a telephone number for individuals to call with any questions they may have.

by providing this notice, fpa does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of new hampshire law, personal jurisdiction or other related rights.

subject: [external] notification of blackbaud data incident

from: santa rosa junior college foundation

to: laggos, sarah

dear sarah,

we take the trust of our community members seriously and are committed to protecting their personal information. we are writing to inform you that blackbaud, the database software provider we use to maintain alumni, community member, and donor information, experienced a ransomware attack. although blackbaud does not believe that your information was misused in any way, we want to inform you about this incident and the steps we are taking.

what happened?

blackbaud is one of the world's largest software providers to universities, schools, charities, and other nonprofit organizations and offers data management services for the srjc foundation. on august 6, 2020, blackbaud confirmed that in may 2020, they had discovered and stopped a ransomware attack on their computer systems, and srjc foundation data was compromised.

to protect against further compromise of customers' data and to mitigate potential identity theft, blackbaud met the cybercriminal's ransomware demand. blackbaud reports they received confirmation that the cybercriminal destroyed the copied data in exchange for the ransomware payment.

blackbaud stated that they "have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly." they base this on the type of incident, their research, and the involvement of law enforcement and cybersecurity experts. in addition, blackbaud hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web as an extra precautionary measure.

what information was involved?

the cybercriminal did not access your credit card information, bank account information, or social security number. notably, the srjc foundation does not store that information in the blackbaud database (or anywhere else). however, we have determined that the file removed may have contained your contact information, employer information, gender and date of birth, spouse's identity, and a history of your relationship with our organization, such as event participation and record of giving.

what are we doing about the situation?

we are continuing to take measures to understand the full scope of this attack and to protect the personal information of our community members. we believe it is important to inform our community of the blackbaud incident so we can all stay vigilant as we seek additional information from blackbaud regarding:

- why there was a delay between incident discovery and notification to all those affected
- why they're confident the cybercriminals won't misuse or disseminate the data they seized
- the additional security measures they've put in place since the incident and any additional measures they plan to implement

what you can do

we want to emphasize again that no credit card, bank account, or other information of that nature was compromised because the srjc foundation does not store that information in the blackbaud database. however, as a best practice, data security experts recommend that individuals remain vigilant by reviewing their account statements and credit reports closely and reporting any suspicious activities. for example:

- if you receive unsolicited requests for donations from us or other nonprofits, please call the number on the organization's website to confirm the legitimacy of the solicitation.
- obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com.
- if you detect any suspicious activity, promptly notify the financial institution or company where the account is maintained. you should also report any fraudulent activity or suspected incidence of identity theft to law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the federal trade commission.

more information

you can learn more about this data incident at https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident.

we deeply regret any worry or inconvenience this incident may cause you. if you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter, please don't hesitate to contact us at foundation@santarosa.edu or 707-527-4977 (m-f 8am-5pm pst).

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam:

we represent metropolitan community college of kansas city ("mcckc"), located at 3200 broadway blvd., kansas city, mo 64111, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to thirty-four (34) new hampshire residents.

on june 19, 2020, mcckc determined that student and employee information may have been available to an unauthorized party due to a ransomware attack that resulted in certain data being encrypted. following the incident, mcckc immediately engaged a third party to conduct a forensic investigation with the objective of identifying the potential scope of access the threat actor may have had to the environment during the period of unauthorized access, which included arriving at a determination as to whether sensitive personal data was accessed by an unauthorized third party.

the forensic investigation was recently completed and determined that an unauthorized individual may have had access to the mcckc environment. the forensic investigation did not conclude or preclude that data was extracted from mcckc's systems however, it is possible that certain personal data, including names, social security numbers, drivers' license information and medical information of former, prospective, and current students could have been accessed by an unauthorized party. the investigation further determined that the names, social security numbers and bank account information of employees could have been accessible as well, however, there is no evidence that any personal information was extracted from mcckc's systems or subject to actual or attempted misuse.

although the investigation did not find any specific access to any individual's information and mcckc has no indication that data has been extracted from mcckc's systems or misused, mcckc has chosen to notify all potentially impacted parties of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

on or about august 14, 2020, mcckc provided written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes thirty-four (34) new hampshire residents. written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the email attached here as exhibit a.

following confirmation that an unauthorized individual did gain access to the mcckc network, mcckc immediately sought to identify the population of potentially impacted individuals. mcckc is also working to implement additional safeguards meant to further secure data within its environment. mcckc is providing access to credit monitoring services for up to	the information provided describes a ransomware attack resulting in the encryption of certain data, with subsequent forensic investigation indicating unauthorized access to the mcckc environment. although it was not determined whether sensitive personal data was accessed or extracted, names, social security numbers, drivers' license information, medical information of former, prospective, and current students, as well as bank account information of employees could have been accessible to an unauthorized party.

re: notice of data breach

dear [customer name],

we are writing on behalf of dave, inc. (dave) to inform you about a cybersecurity incident affecting certain personal information. we value our relationship with you and take data protection and privacy issues seriously. this notification provides you with information about the incident and outlines additional steps you may take to help protect yourself.

what happened?

as a result of a breach at a former third-party service provider, an unauthorized party illegally accessed and stole certain customer data at dave between june 23 and july 1, 2020. as soon as we became aware of this incident on july 1, 2020, our security team quickly took steps to secure our systems including our customers' accounts. we immediately began an investigation, retained a leading cybersecurity firm, and notified law enforcement, including the federal bureau of investigation (fbi). after the compromise at dave's service provider, the unauthorized party was able to gain temporary access to dave's systems and obtained certain dave customer data. it appears this data is now posted online as available for sale on, or download from, illicit online marketplaces, which the fbi is aware of and is investigating. you are receiving this notice because we determined that your records are among those that may have been impacted.

what information was involved?

the types of data that may have been exposed as a result of this incident included the following. however, not every customer had every data element exposed:

- first and last name
- gender
- email
- profile image
- phone
- hashed password
- date of birth
- encrypted social security number
- physical address
- customer application preferences (e.g., notification frequency, default tip percentage, etc.)

importantly, the breach did not affect bank account numbers, credit card numbers, or records of financial transactions. dave has no evidence of fraudulent customer account usage or that any customer has experienced any financial loss as a result of this incident. we also have no evidence to indicate the unauthorized party accessed the encryption keys used to encrypt your social security number. social security numbers were encrypted using aes-256 encryption and customer passwords were stored in illegible form using bcrypt, an industry-recognized hashing algorithm. we subsequently confirmed, however, the likelihood that a party was able to	the unauthorized party illegally accessed and stole certain customer data, indicating that this was a hack by an outside party.

notice of data breach

dear << name 1 >>:

we value and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing on behalf of saint lukes foundation (slf) to inform you of a recent security incident involving one of our third-party vendors that may have affected some of your information and share some steps that you can take to help protect yourself. slf is a non-profit organization and affiliated foundation of saint lukes health system (slhs).

what happened?

on july 16, 2020, we were notified by one of our third-party vendors, blackbaud, that it had experienced a security incident potentially involving certain limited information it obtained from slf. blackbaud is a widely used constituent relationship management software provider for engagement and fundraising offices in higher education and nonprofits. blackbaud informed us that it discovered and stopped a ransomware attack, but not before some information may have been compromised. according to information provided to us by blackbaud, the cybercriminal removed a copy of our backup file for the purpose of extorting funds from blackbaud. blackbaud stated that the ransomware attack and data compromise occurred at some point between february 7, 2020, and may 20, 2020. based on the nature of the incident, their research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, blackbaud has assured us that it has no reason to believe that any data went beyond this cybercriminal or was disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. blackbaud further stated that they have taken additional steps to ensure that the backup file was permanently deleted.

what information was involved?

blackbaud has informed us that the cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information or social security numbers, as this information was encrypted and stored in a separate backup system from what was compromised. blackbaud has also informed us that the compromised backup file may have contained some of your patient demographic and guarantor information, such as name, mailing address, and telephone number as well as your email address and date of birth, and possibly limited medical information about you, such as date of service and department of care.

what we are doing

as part of its ongoing efforts to help avoid an event like this from happening in the future, blackbaud has affirmed to slf that it has already implemented changes to help protect its system from any subsequent incidents. since learning of the issue, blackbaud identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and has taken actions to fix it. additionally, blackbaud is accelerating their efforts to further harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint, and network-based platforms. as an additional precautionary measure, blackbaud has indicated that it has hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web for any further misuse of the data.

what you can do

please review the enclosed other important information document included with this letter for further steps you can take to protect your information, including recommendations by the federal trade commission regarding identity theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file. although no social security numbers or financial account information were involved, as best practice, we recommend you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your credit reports for unauthorized activity.

for more information

if you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at between 8 a.m. 8 p.m. central time, monday through friday. additional information about this incident can be found at https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident.

sincerely,

re: data security incident notice

dear office of the attorney general:

my law firm represents dave, inc. ("dave"). pursuant to n.h. rev. stat. 359-c:20, i am writing to notify you of a data security incident at dave involving approximately 4,806 residents of new hampshire.

nature of the data security incident

as a result of a breach at a former third-party service provider, an unauthorized party illegally accessed and stole certain customer data at dave between june 23 and july 1, 2020. as soon as dave became aware of this incident on july 1, 2020, dave's security team quickly took steps to secure the company's systems, including its customers' accounts. dave immediately began an investigation, retained a leading cybersecurity firm, and notified law enforcement, including the federal bureau of investigation (fbi).

after the compromise at dave's service provider, the unauthorized party was able to gain temporary access to dave's systems and obtained certain dave customer data. it appears this data is now posted online as available for sale on, or download from, illicit online marketplaces, which the fbi is aware of and is investigating.

the types of data that may have been exposed as a result of this incident included the following. however, not every customer had every data element exposed:

- first and last name
- email
- phone
- date of birth
- physical address
- gender
- profile image
- customer application preferences (e.g., notification frequency, default tip percentage, etc.)
- hashed password
- encrypted social security number

importantly, the breach did not affect bank account numbers, credit card numbers, or records of financial transactions. dave has no evidence of fraudulent customer account usage or that any customer has experienced any financial loss as a result of this incident. dave also has no evidence to indicate the unauthorized party accessed the encryption keys used to encrypt social security numbers. social security numbers were encrypted using encryption and customer passwords were stored in illegible form using bcrypt, an industry-recognized hashing algorithm. dave subsequently confirmed the likelihood that a party was able to crack or determine the plain text characters of at least some of the stolen hashed passwords.

remedial steps

dave is no longer working with the third-party service provider whose security breach enabled the unauthorized party to ultimately obtain dave's customer data. moreover, upon dave's discovery of the incident, dave's security team quickly took steps to secure the company's systems, including its customers' accounts. dave retained a leading cybersecurity company to investigate and to provide remediation recommendations. dave has forced a reset of all customer login credentials and is requiring all customers to change their passwords. when logging in, customers will receive instructions on how to change their password, which they should do immediately. dave is also advising customers to change passwords on any other sites where they used the password they had previously used with dave. dave's security team has also put in place additional technical measures to enhance account security, in consultation with independent cybersecurity experts, which will provide additional layers of security and protection.

notification to affected new hampshire residents

notices to the approximately 4,806 new hampshire residents whose personal information was compromised will be sent beginning tomorrow based on available contact information, by email as authorized, or via u.s. mail. in addition, the company is posting information about the incident on its website and major social media platforms, as well as to major statewide print and broadcast media. dave has made arrangements for potentially affected customers to receive complimentary identity theft protection services through december 31, 2021. additional information and instructions for enrolling in the identity theft protection services are included in the notification made to the affected parties.

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam:

we represent heifer project international (heifer international) located at 1 world avenue, little rock, arkansas 72202, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to six thousand three hundred thirteen (6,313) iowa residents. the investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. by providing this notice, heifer international does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of iowa law, the applicability of the iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

nature of the data event

on or about july 16, 2020, heifer international received notification from one of its third-party vendors, blackbaud, inc. (blackbaud), of a cyber incident. blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to organizations, including heifer. upon receiving notice of the cyber incident, heifer international immediately commenced an investigation to better understand the nature and scope of the incident and any impact on heifer international data.

on or about july 22, 2020, heifer received further information from blackbaud that allowed it to determine the information potentially affected may have contained personal information. blackbaud reported that in may 2020, it experienced a ransomware incident that resulted in encryption of certain blackbaud systems. blackbaud reported the incident to law enforcement and worked with forensic investigators to investigate. following its investigation, blackbaud notified its customers that an unknown actor may have accessed or acquired certain blackbaud customer data. blackbaud reported that data was exfiltrated by the unknown actor at some point before blackbaud locked the unknown actor out of the environment on may 20, 2020.

upon learning of the blackbaud incident, heifer international immediately began to determine what, if any, sensitive heifer international data was potentially involved. our investigation determined that the involved blackbaud system contained personal information, including names, drivers license number, and financial account number.

notice to iowa residents

on or about friday, august 21, 2020, heifer international provided written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes six thousand three hundred thirteen (6,313) iowa residents. written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon discovering the event, heifer international moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of heifer international systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. heifer international is also working to implement additional safeguards and training to its employees. additionally, heifer international is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank.

heifer international is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, information on protecting against tax fraud, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law	heifer project international experienced a ransomware incident from one of its third-party vendors blackbaud and personal information such as names, drivers license number, and financial account number of iowa resident was potentially accessed.

arbitersports is committed to protecting the confidentiality of our customers' information. we are writing to notify you that we recently identified and addressed a data security incident that involved some of your information. this notice provides you with a description of the incident, our response, and the steps you may take.

what happened?

on behalf of brown-forman, we are writing to inform you about a recent cyber attack that involved personal information housed on the brown-forman network. we want to be sure you are aware of the actions the company is taking, what actions you can take to keep your data as secure as possible, and recommendations on how to monitor your personal information. we sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident may cause you and know that it comes at an already difficult time.

what happened

on july 28, 2020, we discovered suspicious activity in our internal network and promptly began to investigate and contain it. on august 4, 2020, we learned the cybercriminals stole certain records containing information about some of our current and former employees. in some cases, these records contained limited information about employee dependents or beneficiaries. out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this letter to all current employees of brown-forman as well as former employees who worked at brown-forman as of 2013 to alert them of this incident. we will notify you separately if your beneficiaries or dependents were impacted.

what information was involved

we believe the incident involved information regarding current and former employees, as well as certain beneficiaries and dependents of those employees. this includes information such as names, social security numbers, work contact information (such as brown-forman email address), home address, position, business title, and salary-related information (such as base pay, hire date, and weekly hours worked).

what we are doing

we began investigating the incident as soon as we became aware of suspicious activity on our network. we took several steps to limit access to our network to prevent further data from being compromised or stolen, engaged outside forensic experts to help us better understand the impact of this incident, and are cooperating with law enforcement.

what you can do

we are providing you with the following information about general steps that you can take to protect against potential misuse of personal information. please remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft, including by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. if you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or suspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions.

additionally, you may contact the federal trade commission (ftc) or local law enforcement, including your attorney general, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. to learn more, you can go to the ftc's website at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, call the ftc at (877) idtheft (438-4338), or write to ftc at federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20580.

you may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. if you discover information on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. in addition, under the federal fair credit reporting act (fcra), you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. you may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. you may contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at:

you also have other rights under the fcra. for further information about your rights under the fcra, please visit: http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201410_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf.

lastly, you can obtain additional information from the ftc and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes. for example, you can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. a fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. you may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. as soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file. in addition, you can contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies at the following numbers to place a security freeze to restrict access to your credit report:

equifax: (800) 685-1111
experian: (888) 397-3742

you may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company.

since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information:

contents of data breach notification letter: dear parent,

we are writing to inform you of a recent incident that involved your data. lemoore union high school district (luhsd) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our students' information and that of their parents.

what happened?

luhsd uses the aeries student information system to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. in late november 2019, aeries learned that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. upon discovery, aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who aeries believes is now in police custody. on april 27, 2020, aeries confirmed to us that this individual may have accessed luhsd's aeries system.

what information was involved?

the information accessed by the perpetrator potentially included parent and/or student name, home address, phone number, email address, and hashed password - a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties - for the aeries system.

what you can do

even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. even though the password itself was not accessed, it is possible that an individual with enough time and skill could eventually decipher the password. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, you will be required to change your password the next time you sign into your account. additionally, if you use the same password for other online accounts, we recommend changing the password for those accounts as well.

what we are doing

we understand the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and we regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause. in order to avoid the possibility of unauthorized access to the accounts involved, we are requiring all account holders whose accounts were involved to change their passwords. to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future, we installed the software patch that aeries made available to remedy the vulnerability that allowed the unauthorized individual to access our aeries system. in addition, we and aeries are reviewing our existing policies and procedures to mitigate any risk associated with this incident and to better prevent future incidents.

for more information

we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. if you have any questions, please call the luhsd district office between 8:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., email noreply@luhsd.k12.ca.us, and someone will contact you.

sincerely,

debbie muro, superintendent	the data breach was caused by an unauthorized individual exploiting a vulnerability in the aeries software that allowed access to student and parent information. upon discovery, aeries began an investigation, and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who aeries believes is now in police custody.

re: notice of data breach

dear [individual],

at amphastar pharmaceuticals, inc., and its subsidiaries international medication systems, ltd., and armstrong pharmaceuticals, inc. (collectively, the company), we take the privacy of our employees and former employees very seriously. it is important to us that you are made aware of an isolated security incident involving your personal information and to identify steps you can take to protect yourself. the company has policies in place to protect confidential information including the personal information of its employees.

what happened?

on july 24, 2020, the company learned for the first time that some company data had been posted on the internet without authorization on july 21. most of the information was legacy data (approximately 15 years old) and included some of your personal information along with other company records.

the company immediately investigated this posting to learn what happened with the assistance of a leading specialist routinely retained to assess and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. the posting was determined to be related to an earlier ransomware attack on may 2, 2020 that had been fully contained without any indication that data had been removed based on available records. no payment was or will be made to the criminals responsible for this malicious/criminal act. the company was able to use backups and restore business continuity promptly. as law enforcement and others have reported, ransomware attacks have increased and have targeted the healthcare industry in the united states and around the world including during the global pandemic.

1what information was involved?

the personal information that was involved included your first and last name, and social security number. to be clear, other personal information was not involved. for example, the company has concluded that there was no drivers license number or government identification number, credit card or financial account number, medical or health insurance information, biometric data, or user name or email address along with a password or security question and answer.

what we are doing

we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take this matter very seriously. after reviewing and investigating this incident, while we have no evidence that your information was misused, we concluded that it is important to make you aware of this incident. we are also providing 24 months of fraud detection and identity restoration services through experian, at no cost to you, as summarized in the attachment (how to enroll in credit monitoring).

what you can do

we encourage you to consider these measures to monitor and protect your personal information and to remain vigilant for potential incidents of fraud and identity theft:

vigilance: regularly monitor your financial accounts and, if you see any unfamiliar activity, promptly contact your financial institution. monitor your credit reports, which are available free of charge, as noted below.

free annual credit report: obtain a free annual credit report from each of the three national consumer credit reporting companies (experian, equifax, and transunion) by calling (877) 322-8228 or by logging onto www.annualcreditreport.com.

fraud alert: you may place a fraud alert on your credit file to ask creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. this request, which can be made from any of the three national consumer credit reporting companies, can help detect any possible misuse of your personal information. note that a fraud alert may protect you but also may cause delay when you seek to obtain credit. the initial fraud alert is active for 90 days and can be renewed.

security freeze: you may place a security freeze on your credit files. a freeze prevents an authorized person from using your personal identifying information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national consumer credit reporting companies at the toll-free telephone numbers or websites listed below. the fee is $10 for each credit reporting agency, but the agencies may waive the fee if you can prove that identity theft has occurred. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze.

subject: an update from jgi

dear friends of jgi,

we're reaching out to let you know that the jane goodall institute was notified of a data security incident at one of our vendors, blackbaud. we believe that alerting you is the right thing to do in the interests of transparency and fairness that are at the heart of our organization.

blackbaud works with many large and small nonprofits, including the jane goodall institute, to support fundraising and engagement efforts. last week, blackbaud notified us that it was the target of a ransomware attack that involved the information of a number of its clients. as a result, the hackers obtained some personally identifying information about blackbaud's nonprofit clients' donors and prospective donors, including those of the jane goodall institute. we believe your information was likely involved.

please note that no credit card or bank account information was compromised in this attack, as this information is kept separately and encrypted. your social security number is not in any of our systems and therefore is also not impacted. blackbaud believes they have successfully retrieved the stolen data and prevented it from being used in an unauthorized way. we believe this is true, but are following up to verify.

our contracts with blackbaud have always required them to keep our constituent information confidential and to have security procedures in place to minimize breaches. we are conducting an independent inquiry into this incident and are actively investigating the cause of the incident, the data involved, details of the incident, and blackbaud's plans to prevent reoccurrence. we are also exploring all options to ensure this does not happen again, including the possibility of using a provider other than blackbaud going forward.

for more information from blackbaud on the incident, visit: https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident

the privacy of donors and supporters like you is of the utmost importance, and we promise to do everything in our power to ensure your private information remains secure. please know that we are here for you to answer questions via telephone at (703) 682 - 9242 or via email at inquiries@janegoodall.org.

sincerely,

steve woodruff
chair, board of directors
the jane goodall institute	the ransomware attack on blackbaud resulted in the compromise of personal information of blackbaud's clients, including the jane goodall institute. no unauthorized access, intended disclosure or physical loss is mentioned, and as the third-party vendor was hacked the label hack best reflects this.

on or about july 22, 2020, jgi learned that in may 2020, blackbaud, a vendor that supports jgi's fundraising and engagement efforts, experienced a ransomware attack on systems that contained information of a number of its nonprofit clients. as a result, hackers obtained personally identifying information about blackbaud's nonprofit clients' donors and prospective donors, including those of jgi. jgi initially believed that blackbaud had sent or would send notifications to state authorities like your office, but it subsequently learned that was not the case. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, jgi is sending this notice to you at this time.

after investigation, jgi has determined that information on blackbaud's systems at the time of the ransomware incident did not include credit card or bank account information because this information is kept separately and encrypted. nor were social security numbers of donors or prospective donors impacted, because jgi does not keep this information on its systems.

at this time, jgi has no evidence that the personal information of its affected donors and prospective donors has been used inappropriately. jgi's contracts with blackbaud require blackbaud to keep jgi's donor information confidential and to have security procedures in place, and blackbaud has indicated to jgi that it has successfully retrieved the stolen data and prevented it from being used in an unauthorized way. nevertheless, jgi sent notifications by mail and email to affected donors and prospective donors to explain what happened, what information was involved, what jgi has done and how affected donors and prospective donors can contact jgi with questions.

further information about what jgi has done and is recommending to the individuals in question can be found in the enclosed notification that jgi sent to approximately 839 iowa residents via mail and email on july 31, 2020. jgi notified 539 iowa residents via mail, and jgi notified affected individuals whose state of residence is unknown via email. of the individuals notified by email, jgi estimates that 300 live in iowa.

if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

subject: an update from jgi

dear friends of jgi,

we're reaching out to let you know that the jane goodall institute was notified of a data security incident at one of our vendors, blackbaud. we believe that alerting you is the right thing to do in the interests of transparency and fairness that are at the heart of our organization.

blackbaud works with many large and small nonprofits, including the jane goodall institute, to support fundraising and engagement efforts. last week, blackbaud notified us that it was the target of a ransomware attack that involved the information of a number of its clients. as a result, the hackers obtained some personally identifying information about blackbaud's nonprofit clients' donors and prospective donors, including those of the jane goodall institute. we believe your information was likely involved.

please note that no credit card or bank account information was compromised in this attack, as this information is kept separately and encrypted. your social security number is not in any of our systems and therefore is also not impacted. blackbaud believes they have successfully retrieved the stolen data and prevented it from being used in an unauthorized way. we believe this is true, but are following up to verify.

our contracts with blackbaud have always required them to keep our constituent information confidential and to have security procedures in place to minimize breaches. we are conducting an independent inquiry into this incident and are actively investigating the cause of the incident, the data involved, details of the incident, and blackbaud's plans to prevent reoccurrence. we are also exploring all options to ensure this does not happen again, including the possibility of using a provider other than blackbaud going forward.

for more information from blackbaud on the incident, visit: https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident

the privacy of donors and supporters like you is of the utmost importance, and we promise to do everything in our power to ensure your private information remains secure. please know that we are here for you to answer questions via telephone at (703) 682-9242 or via email at inquiries@janegoodall.org.

sincerely,

re: data security incident

dear attorney general becerra:

wilson elser moskowitz edelman and dicker llp (wilson elser) represents ferris marketing, inc. (ferris), a computer and office equipment wholesaler, with respect to a potential data security incident involving night owl security products llc (night owl), a subsidiary of ferris, (hereinafter, the incident) described in more detail below. ferris takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

1. nature of the security incident.

on may 29, 2020, ferris was alerted by visa inc. (visa) that night owls retail website - https://nightowlsp.com/ - was the last common point of purchase (cpp) for credit cards legitimately used to purchase products from night owl which were later used to make fraudulent purchases using visa payment cards. upon further investigation by ferris, ferris discovered on june 5, 2020 that this incident was likely caused by an unknown cyber attackers malicious insertion of a script onto night owls website which allowed the cyber attacker to orchestrate a credit card fraud scheme against those who made purchases on night owls website after the malicious script was dropped on or around november 1, 2019 and before it was removed on june 5, 2020.

at this time, ferris has no evidence to indicate that the individual responsible for the cyber incident viewed or otherwise acquired any personal information belonging to california residents other than names, addresses, and any payment card information previously used to make a purchase on night owls website.

2. number of california residents affected.

on or about july 13, 2020, ferris finished identifying one thousand four hundred and thirty-nine (1,439) california residents who were potentially affected by this incident. incident notification letters addressed to these individuals were mailed on july 31, 2020, via first class mail. a sample copy of the incident notification letter being mailed to potentially affected residents of california is included with this letter.

3. steps taken.

on june 5, 2020, the same day that ferris identified the malware infection on night owls retail website, ferris removed the infection and shut down public access to night owls retail website. during the following twenty days, ferris took steps to ensure the security of night owls website including the migration to a different hosting provider as well as the performance of upgrades to its network and software. night owls website reopened for public use on june 26, 2020.

ferris has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. these steps include strengthening ferriss cybersecurity posture by implementing enhanced software monitoring programs and firewall protection to resist the future occurrence of any similar cybersecurity events.

ferris has also gone to great lengths to identify and notify any individuals who were potentially impacted as a result of this incident, including the hiring of a third-party vendor to arrange for any potentially affected residents of california to receive complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for twelve (12) months.

4. contact information.

ferris remains dedicated to protecting the sensitive information within its control. if you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at robert.walker@wilsonelser.com or (601) 499-8083.	ferris marketing inc. experienced a data breach due to a script being inserted onto night owl security products llc's website by an unknown cyber attacker, which allowed the attacker to orchestrate a credit card fraud scheme against those who made purchases on night owl's website after the malicious script was dropped on or around november 1, 2019, and before it was removed on june 5, 2020.

on behalf of warner music group (wmg), and consistent with iowa code ann. 715c.2, this letter provides notice of a computer data security incident. although our investigation is ongoing, based on currently known information, wmg believes approximately 967 potentially affected individuals reside in your state.

wmg is a music entertainment company that also sells merchandise on behalf of a number of bands and artists with which it works. on august 5, 2020, wmg learned that an unauthorized third party had compromised a number of us-based e-commerce websites that wmg operates but that are hosted and supported by an external service provider. this allowed the unauthorized third party to potentially acquire a copy of information customers entered on the affected websites after placing an item into their shopping carts. this could have impacted purchases made with credit cards from the affected websites between april 25, 2020 and august 5, 2020. the information compromised could have included the individuals name, email address, telephone number, billing address, shipping address, and payment card details (card number, cvc/cvv and expiration date).

upon discovering the incident, wmg immediately launched a thorough forensic investigation with the assistance of leading outside cybersecurity experts and promptly took steps to address and correct the issue. wmg continues to conduct daily scans to monitor for any suspicious activity and, at this time, wmgs believe that the third party's unauthorized access has been eliminated. wmg also notified the relevant card providers as well as law enforcement, and is continuing to work with both the card providers and law enforcement.

while wmg cannot definitively confirm which individuals' data was potentially acquired by the unauthorized third party, wmg is in the process of notifying potentially affected customers in accordance with applicable legal requirements	there was an unauthorized third party who compromised a number of us-based e-commerce websites that wmg operates but are hosted and supported by an external service provider, allowing them to acquire a copy of information customers entered, including payment card details.

vermont student assistance corporation (vsac) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect the security of some of your information. on july 16, 2020, vsac received notice that one of its third-party vendors, blackbaud, inc. (blackbaud), suffered a cyber incident. blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to many non-profit organizations, including vsac. while we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we are providing you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect yourself, should you feel it necessary to do so.

what happened?

in may 2020, blackbaud experienced a ransomware incident that impacted certain systems within the blackbaud environment. as a result of this incident, certain blackbaud systems were encrypted and a blackbaud database backup file including vsac data was removed from the blackbaud environment by an unauthorized actor. while blackbaud's investigation was able to determine that the backup file was removed between february 7, 2020, and may 20, 2020, their investigation was unable to confirm exactly when this occurred. as a result, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain information contained within the backup database. upon learning of this incident, vsac immediately began an investigation to determine the full nature and scope of the event and what, if any, vsac data may have been impacted. on or about august 7, 2020, vsac's investigation determined that the backup database may have contained personal information.

what information was involved?

while blackbaud reports that information was accessed, blackbaud was unable to confirm what, if any, specific sensitive information was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor. blackbaud has also represented to us that they have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. regardless, out of an abundance of caution, vsac is notifying you of this incident because you are or were a customer or client of vsac, and information related to you was potentially present in the database at the time of this incident. our investigation determined that the information related to you included your name and social security number. to date, vsac has not received any reports of actual or attempted misuse of your information.

what are we doing?

the confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care are one of our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. when we were notified of this incident, we immediately commenced an investigation to determine what vsac data may have been at risk. as part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information in our care, we are working to review our existing policies and procedures regarding our third-party vendors and are working with blackbaud to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future	the breach was due to a ransomware incident and the unauthorized actor removed a backup file containing vsac data from the blackbaud environment. blackbaud was unable to confirm what specific sensitive information was accessed, but vsac's investigation revealed that the data may have included personal information, such as names and social security numbers.

notice of data breach

dear member of the pkd community,

we are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may involve your personal information. we take the privacy of your information seriously, and as a precautionary measure, we want to let you know what happened.

on july 16, 2020, we were contacted by blackbaud, one of the world's largest providers of customer relationship management systems for non-profit organizations and the higher education sector. blackbaud informed us that a service provider had been the victim of a ransomware attack that culminated in may 2020. although the cybercriminal was unsuccessful in blocking access to the database involved in the attack, they were able to remove a copy of a subset of data from several of blackbaud's clients, including data of polycystic kidney disease foundation.

we would like to reassure you that a detailed forensic investigation was undertaken by law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity experts on behalf of blackbaud. blackbaud has confirmed that the cybercriminal did not access your credit or debit card information, bank account information, or social security number because that information was stored in an encrypted format. also, please note that polycystic kidney disease foundation does not store social security numbers or bank account information. the data accessed by the cybercriminal in the blackbaud database may have contained some of the following information in some of the data records:

- public information such as name, title, date of birth, spouse
- addresses and contact details such as phone numbers and email addresses
- philanthropic interests, giving capacity, and giving history to the polycystic kidney disease foundation
- transplant status

blackbaud has taken steps to protect constituent data of blackbaud clients like polycystic kidney disease foundation and mitigate potential identity theft. blackbaud met the cybercriminal's ransomware demand to ensure that the data was destroyed and is no longer usable or accessible by any unauthorized persons or entities. blackbaud continues to monitor the web to verify that the data accessed by the cybercriminal has not been misused.

upon notification of this breach by blackbaud, we immediately launched our investigation and have taken the following steps:

- we are notifying affected volunteers, donors, employees, and others in our network that may have been affected to make them aware of this breach of blackbaud's systems.
- we are working with blackbaud to understand why there was a delay between it finding the breach and notifying us, as well as what actions blackbaud is taking to increase its security to ensure our data will be protected against future threats.
- we are conferring with other blackbaud clients to share information about this breach, resulting corrective actions, and identify any additional recommended best practices.

we do not believe there is a need for our constituents to take any action at this time. although your financial account information was not accessed in this security breach, we recommend that you remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious account activity or suspected identity theft to the proper authorities. we recommend that you obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months. you may also want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report.

for more information, please visit identitytheft.gov or call 1-877-id-theft (877-438-4338).

if you have any questions related to the security incident, please contact chad iseman, polycystic kidney disease foundation, chief advancement officer, (800) 753-2873, prompt #3, and pkdcure@pkdcure.org. we regret the inconvenience that this data breach may have caused. please be assured that we take data protection very seriously and are grateful for the continued support of our alumni and friends.

sincerely,

andy betts, president and ceo

dear xxxxxxxx,

we are writing to let you know of a recent data security incident at blackbaud inc., a data service vendor for the hydrocephalus association (ha). blackbaud is a leading provider of software services and hosts files or backups for hundreds of schools, foundations, and nonprofits like ha around the world. blackbaud recently informed us that it discovered and resolved a cybersecurity incident impacting its systems, which affected many of its nonprofit clients, including ha.

what happened?

we are contacting you regarding this incident with blackbaud because some of your personal information may have been disclosed. on july 16, 2020, blackbaud sent an email to ha stating that it had discovered a security incident in may of 2020. blackbaud determined that an unauthorized third party had removed a copy of certain non-financial data, including data from ha and other blackbaud clients, at some point between february 7, 2020, and may 20, 2020. although blackbaud told us that it believes the data was destroyed after blackbaud made a payment in response to a demand from the unauthorized third party, we cannot independently confirm the destruction of the data. blackbaud has provided additional details about this incident on its website.

what information was involved?

first and foremost, please be reassured that your bank account or credit card information was not involved in this incident, as ha does not retain financial information within our database. on august 14, 2020, we determined that specific information you shared with us through membership communications, registrations, or surveys may have been part of this breach. this could include name, address, your connection to ha, the date of birth of you or your loved one with hydrocephalus, and limited health information (e.g., patient's name, age of diagnosis, type of hydrocephalus, and/or comorbidities or complications), to the extent you provided this information.

for clarity, please know that the incident did not involve information associated with our patient registry, happier. information for that patient registry is stored in a separate database at the university of utah, outside of blackbaud. that information is de-identified, meaning the information that could link it to you has been removed, and it is not part of this incident. information stored in hydroassist, our mobile app, is also not a part of this incident. hydroassist data is stored in a separate database outside of blackbaud.

what we are doing.

we are extremely frustrated about this event and take this matter very seriously. safeguarding your personal information is a top priority for us. we are not aware of any misuse to date of the compromised information, and as previously stated, blackbaud has communicated its confidence that the data was destroyed. regardless, upon learning of this incident, we immediately began working to investigate the incident and to identify and notify individuals affected.

we require blackbaud to keep our information confidential and to maintain security procedures to minimize the risk of information security incidents. if an information security incident does occur, blackbaud is required to notify us, to work with us to mitigate negative consequences from the incident, and to implement procedures to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. we will review our work with blackbaud to ensure it meets that commitment and are in the process of evaluating our relationship with blackbaud more generally.

what you can do.

although no credit card or bank account information was compromised as part of this incident, given the increased threats to privacy in our world we recommend that you remain vigilant and regularly review and monitor all of your credit history to guard against any unauthorized transactions or activity. we also recommend that you closely monitor your account statements and notify your financial institution if you suspect any unauthorized activity. additionally, you should not provide personal information in response to electronic communications regarding security breaches. attachment a contains more information about steps you can take to protect yourself against fraud and identity theft.

for more information

please be assured that we are taking steps to address the incident and to protect the security of your data. if you have any questions about this notice or the incident, please feel free to contact us at security@hydroassoc.org.

additional information

to protect against possible fraud, identity theft or other financial loss, we encourage you to remain vigilant, to review your account statements and to monitor your credit reports. provided below are the names and contact information for the three major u.s. credit bureaus and additional information about steps you can take to obtain a free credit report and place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report. if you believe you are a victim of fraud or identity theft, you should consider contacting your local law enforcement agency, your state's attorney general, or the federal trade commission.

information on obtaining a free credit report

u.s. residents are entitled under u.s. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. to order your free credit reports, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free (877) 322-8228.

information on implementing a fraud alert, credit freeze, or credit lock

to place a fraud alert, credit freeze, or credit lock on your credit report, you must contact the three credit reporting agencies below:

fraud alert: consider contacting the three major credit reporting agencies at the addresses below to place a fraud alert on your credit report. a fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. a fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit. instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name.

to place a fraud alert, contact any of the three major credit reporting agencies listed above and request that a fraud alert be put on your file. the agency that you contacted must notify the other two agencies. a fraud alert is free and lasts 90 days but can be renewed.

credit freeze: a credit freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer's credit report until the freeze is lifted. when a credit freeze is in place, no one including you can open a new account. as a result, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services. placing a credit freeze is free. to place a credit freeze, contact all three credit reporting agencies listed above and provide the personal information required by each agency to place a freeze, which may include:

1. your full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);
2. social	the breach was due to an unauthorized third-party gaining access and removing certain non-financial data, a common sign of a hack.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear slidely and promo community,

i am writing to notify you about a targeted breach of some of our servers which hold some of our customers' account information but do not include any financial data. whilst the issue has been identified and resolved, we continue to work closely with cybersecurity experts and relevant authorities and have already implemented further security measures and features. this message provides important information. we would like to apologize sincerely for the inconvenience caused.

on july 21, 2020, our team became aware that a data security vulnerability on a third-party service which affected many companies had caused a breach affecting certain non-finance related slidely and promo user data. we immediately launched an internal investigation to identify what had occurred and to take all necessary steps to protect our customers.

first and foremost, no financial data such as credit cards or billing information was accessed as we never store this information on our servers. the breached servers held the following data: first name, last name, email address, ip address, approximated user location based on the ip address, gender, as well as encrypted, hashed, and salted passwords to slidely and promo. your account password was hashed and salted (a method used to secure passwords with a key), however, it is possible that it could subsequently have been decoded.

we have acted immediately and are taking this incident and the security of your information extremely seriously. we are protecting you and the rest of our community in the following ways:

- we are sending you this update with recommendations on what you should do
- we have completely removed the vulnerable third-party service from our platform
- we've hired a leading cybersecurity specialist to further review and reinforce our protections
- we continuously enhance our safeguards and systems that detect and prevent unauthorized access to user accounts

as an immediate precautionary measure, you should reset the password to your slidely or promo account as soon as possible. to do so, please use this link: https://promo.com/forgot and follow the instructions there. also, if you have been using the same or a similar password for other online accounts, we strongly recommend you change those passwords to protect those accounts as well.

following our initial email to you on july 23, about a targeted breach of some of our servers which hold some of our customers' account information but do not include any financial data, i am writing to provide further important information. first, we would again like to apologize sincerely for the inconvenience caused. as we mentioned in our earlier email on july 23, the issue has been identified and resolved, and we continue to work closely with cybersecurity experts and relevant authorities and have already implemented further security measures and features.

on july 21, 2020, our team became aware of a data security vulnerability on a third-party service which affected many companies. this caused a breach that occurred between june 22-25, affecting certain non-financial related slidely and promo user data. we immediately launched an internal investigation to identify what had occurred and took all necessary steps to protect our customers.

first and foremost, no financial data such as credit cards or billing information was accessed as we never store this information on our servers. the breached servers held the following data: first name, last name, email address, ip address, approximated user location based on the ip address, gender, as well as encrypted, hashed, and salted passwords to slidely and promo. your account password was hashed and salted (a method used to secure passwords with a key); it is possible, however, that it could subsequently have been decoded.

we acted immediately. we are taking this incident and the security of your information extremely seriously. we are protecting you and the rest of our community in the following ways:

- we are sending you this update with recommendations on what you should do
- we have completely removed the vulnerable third-party service from our platform
- we've hired a leading cybersecurity specialist to further review and reinforce our protections
- we continuously enhance our safeguards and systems that detect and prevent unauthorized access to user accounts

as a precautionary measure, you should reset the password to your slidely or promo account as soon as possible if you haven't done so already. to do this, please use this link: https://promo.com/forgot and follow the instructions there. also, if you have been using the same or a similar password for other online accounts, we strongly recommend you change those passwords to protect those accounts as well.

no financial data, such as credit cards or billing information, was accessed as we never store this information on our servers, but government agencies generally advise that consumers remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports. you can obtain information from the federal trade commission and the credit reporting agencies about fraud alerts and security freezes. a security freeze prevents most potential creditors from viewing your credit reports and therefore, further restricts the opening of unauthorized accounts. a fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts.

for more information, please contact us at support@promo.com. we are working around the clock and are here to help and support you.

sincerely,

contents of data breach notification letter: dear valued bidder,

we take the protection of your information very seriously. unfortunately, we are writing to inform you about a data security issue affecting your liveauctioneers bidder account information. we are deeply sorry for any concern or inconvenience this may have caused, and are working quickly to take the appropriate steps to prevent such incidents in the future. we hope that in time we can regain your trust, which we value above all.

what happened

our cybersecurity team has indeed confirmed that following a cyber attack against one of our it suppliers on june 19, 2020, an unauthorized third party managed to access certain personal information from our bidder database. we were notified of the incident on july 11, 2020, and began notifying bidders that day through email and our website, based on how recently the bidder had used their liveauctioneers account.

liveauctioneers was one of a number of their partners who experienced a breach since this it supplier's security was compromised. our cybersecurity team has ensured the unauthorized access has ceased.

what information was involved

the data that has been exposed includes user account information like names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, visit history, and encrypted passwords (the unauthorized party, however, managed to decrypt passwords after the cyber attack). not all of this information may have been present on your bidder account. please also know that complete payment card numbers were not accessed, and we have no reason to believe auction history was affected.

the exposure of your liveauctioneers credentials (i.e. login and password) could affect other online accounts you may have (if they use the same or similar credentials). you could also be exposed to impersonation and phishing attempts.

what we are doing

as soon as we became aware of this incident, we blocked the unauthorized access to bidder account information and disabled your most recent liveauctioneers password.

we have taken immediate steps to improve our security and prevent such incidents in the future:

- we have suspended our relationship with the compromised it supplier.
- our security tokens and passwords throughout liveauctioneers systems have been replaced.
- we have implemented stronger password encryption.
- we have partnered with leading cybersecurity experts to further secure our website, mobile apps, and systems.
- we are working with government authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice.
- multi-factor authentication for all back-end services have been implemented.
- we are analyzing and monitoring our source code to address any vulnerabilities.
- we are continuing to upgrade our network infrastructure.
- we will be implementing stronger password requirements.

what you can do

all passwords created before july 11, 2020, have been disabled. if you have not already done so, we encourage you to change your password.

for not logged in bidders: you can access your account by creating a new password, following the steps below:

1. visit https://www.liveauctioneers.com/ and click log in on the top right-hand corner of the page.
2. click forgot password on the login window.
3. enter your email address used for and click send reset instructions.
4. check your email and follow the link provided to reset your password.

for already logged in bidders: please click the dropdown from your user icon in the top right corner and click account settings. from here, click change password.

to help further protect your personal information, please remember:

- do not use the same or similar credentials for other online accounts.
- change any and all passwords that used the same or similar credentials as those used for your liveauctioneers account.
- regularly review your online accounts for suspicious activity.
- be cautious of any unsolicited communications asking for your personal information: we will never ask you to disclose your password via an email or over the phone, for instance.
- avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails.
- if you see any unauthorized activity related to your financial accounts, promptly contact your financial institution.
- for u.s. residents, we also suggest you submit a complaint with the federal trade commission by calling 1-877-id-theft (1-877-438-4338), online at https://www.ftc.gov, or by mail to 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw washington, dc 20580.

blackbaud reported that, in may 2020, it experienced a ransomware incident that resulted in encryption of certain blackbaud systems. blackbaud reported the incident to law enforcement and worked with forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incident. following its investigation, blackbaud notified its customers that an unknown actor may have accessed or acquired certain blackbaud customer data. blackbaud reported that the data was exfiltrated by the threat actor at some point before blackbaud locked the threat actor out of the environment on may 20, 2020. upon learning of the blackbaud incident, enloe immediately commenced an investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive enloe data was potentially involved. this investigation included working diligently to gather further information from blackbaud to understand the scope of the incident. the blackbaud event affected thousands of organizations across many different states and countries. although not the target of the ransomware incident, enloe was one of the countless organizations that were impacted.

what information was involved?

our investigation determined that the impacted blackbaud systems contained your name, address, medical treatment discharge date, and department where you received care. the system may have also contained your date of birth, phone number, and/or email address. your social security number, credit card number, and bank account information were not present in the blackbaud system and were therefore not subject to unauthorized access. please note that, to date, we have not received confirmation from blackbaud that your specific information was accessed or acquired by the unknown actor.

what we are doing.

the confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care are among our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. as part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information in our care, we are working to review our existing policies and procedures regarding our third-party vendors, and are working with blackbaud to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future. we will also be notifying the united states department of health and human services and state regulators, as required.

re: notice of data breach

dear <<name 1>>:

we want to advise you of a security breach affecting information about you maintained by blackbaud, a third-party service provider of emanate health foundation. this letter explains what happened, what information of yours was involved, and what you can do to protect yourself.

emanate health foundation is dedicated to raising funds and awareness for services that heal and nurture individuals and families throughout the san gabriel valley. we work toward fulfilling this mission by collaborating with community members to financially sustain emanate health and its award-winning, not-for-profit medical facilities: emanate health inter-community hospital, emanate health queen of the valley hospital, emanate health foothill presbyterian hospital, and emanate health hospice. the foundation develops philanthropic support for these medical facilities through charitable donations and community awareness. emanate health physicians, staff, and volunteers work tirelessly to enhance the well-being of our patients and improve their health outcomes, and they rely on the foundation's generous contributors as visionary partners in the process.

unfortunately, the foundation was recently notified by blackbaud of a security incident involving your personal information as a patient of one of our affiliated medical facilities. blackbaud provides services to the foundation and holds information about our donors and prospective donors under a strict confidentiality agreement. we are notifying you to explain the circumstances and to summarize the steps taken as we take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously.

what happened?

on july 16, 2020, the foundation was notified by its third-party provider, blackbaud, of a security incident which involved your personal information. blackbaud notified us that it discovered a ransomware attack on its systems around may 20, 2020. blackbaud retained independent forensics experts and notified law enforcement. shortly after the discovery, blackbaud expelled the cybercriminal from its system. however, blackbaud determined that before being locked out the cybercriminal had removed a copy of the foundations backup file maintained on blackbaud's servers, which contained your personal information. blackbaud believes the cybercriminal accessed this file initially on february 7, 2020, and retained access until may 20, 2020. we understand that blackbaud confirmed that the backup file copy had been destroyed. based on the nature of the incident, blackbaud's research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigations, blackbaud does not believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was misused, or will be further disseminated.

what information was involved?

the information contained in the foundations back-up file maintained on blackbaud's server included your first name, last name, home address, birth date, gender, phone number, e-mail, and the emanate health hospital department location in which you were treated. importantly, blackbaud confirmed that none of the information contained in the back-up file included any individual's credit card information, bank account information, or social security number.

what are we doing?

as part of its ongoing efforts to help avoid an event like this from happening in the future, blackbaud has affirmed to the foundation that it has already implemented changes to help protect its system from any subsequent incidents. since learning of the issue, blackbaud identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and has taken actions to fix it. additionally, blackbaud is accelerating its efforts to further harden its environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint, and network-based platforms. as an additional precautionary measure, blackbaud has indicated that it has hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web for any further misuse of the data.

what can you do?

as a best practice, we recommend you remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities. we also suggest that you review the enclosed document, privacy safeguards, for additional information on how to protect against identity theft and fraud.

for more information

we understand that you may have questions that are not addressed in this notice. if you have additional questions or concerns, please call our toll-free assistance line at 888-490-0760, monday through friday, from 6 am to 6 pm pst.

what happened?

corepower discovered suspicious activity in an employee's email account and immediately changed the employee's email account password. an investigation was launched to identify the source of the activity, and with the help of a third-party forensic specialist, it was discovered that multiple employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized access between november 7, 2019, and february 3, 2020. it was not possible to determine which emails and attachments within the email accounts were accessed or viewed. therefore, the forensic specialist reviewed all the emails and attachments in the email accounts to determine if they contained any sensitive information. on august 13, 2020, the forensic specialist completed its analysis of the email accounts and prepared a list of individuals whose information was determined to be present in the emails or attachments located in the email accounts and possibly viewed by the unauthorized person(s).

what information is involved?

your name and <<breached elements>> were found in the email account. we were unable to determine which emails, if any, in the accounts were subject to unauthorized access, but we are providing notice out of an abundance of caution as your information was contained within the email accounts subject to unauthorized access.

re: notice of data breach

dear constituent,

we are writing to inform you of a recent data breach involving blackbaud, inc. blackbaud, inc. provides donor relations database software systems for episcopal community services (ecs). on july 16, 2020, ecs was notified by blackbaud, inc., one of our third-party service providers, of a security incident. blackbaud discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. after discovering the attack, the service provider's cyber security team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking their system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from their system. however, before locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a backup file containing some constituent information. this occurred at some point beginning on february 7, 2020, and could have been in there intermittently until may 20, 2020.

it is important to note that the cybercriminal did not access data like credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. however, blackbaud has informed us that donor information such as contact information, names, email addresses, mailing addresses, and giving history could have been a part of the data breach.

blackbaud, inc. paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed. based on the nature of the incident, their research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, blackbaud has no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. please note that this breach only affected information on blackbaud's servers for ecs donors and has no impact on ecs clients or programs.

we are notifying you so that you can take immediate action to protect yourself. ensuring the safety of our constituents' data is of the utmost importance to us. as part of their ongoing efforts to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, blackbaud has already implemented several changes that will protect your data from any subsequent incidents. first, blackbaud's teams were able to quickly identify the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and took swift action to fix it. they have confirmed through testing by multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, that their fix withstands all known attack tactics. additionally, they are accelerating efforts to further harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms. you can read more about the security breach on blackbaud's website: https://www.blackbaud.com/security-incident

as a best practice, we recommend you remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities.

we apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience it may cause you. for additional information, please refer to our website at: ecscalifornia.org/blackbaud. should you have any further questions or concerns about this incident and/or the protections available to you, please do not hesitate to contact me at amuir@ecscalifornia.org.

sincerely,

andra muir
director of development	the breach was due to a ransomware attack by a cybercriminal on blackbaud, inc's servers that contained ecs donor data including contact information, names, email addresses, mailing addresses, and giving history. the cybercriminal was able to remove a copy of the data before being discovered and stopped by blackbaud, inc.'s cyber security team, third-party forensics experts, and law enforcement. while blackbaud, inc. has paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed and has implemented changes to prevent further attacks, the breach was due to hacking.

fraud alerts:

you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

credit and security freezes:

you may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies using the contact information above.	the fbi notified california dialysis management services (cdms) that an individual had been arrested in possession of some cdms documents containing personal information of some of their employees. cdms hired a forensic firm to investigate, and has arranged complimentary identity protection services for impacted individuals.

dear rocklin unified school district families,

we are writing to inform you about a data security breach that occurred on nutrikids-nutrilink, the district's student lunch data program that stores some student and parent information regarding nutrition services for rocklin unified school district. we are one of many districts using nutrikids-nutrilink that was affected by this breach. rusd has been a customer of nutrikids-nutrilink for many years, and in that time has had no unauthorized access or data breaches with this software. we do not believe there is any reason to be alarmed or unduly concerned, but we wanted you to be informed about what happened.

timeline with information provided to us from nutrikids-nutrilink:

on september 17, 2020, we were informed by a rocklin unified parent that there was a bug in the nutrilink software that may allow unauthorized access to the nutrikids-nutrilink system. the initial report was focused on nutrikids-nutrilink databases where families can look up information on their student(s), which we do use and link to through our district website. following the steps provided, we were able to confirm the ability to access student information and reported it immediately to nutrikids-nutrilink. on september 18, we were able to speak with nutrilinks coo brent england who verified they were able to fix the bug and remove the ability to gain access through the portal.

this breach may have revealed student first name, last name, student id numbers, and free or reduced lunch status. however, having spoken with mr. england, we were able to confirm that no other data elements were impacted as a result of this incident. social security numbers, credit card data, or other personal information is not kept in our nutrikids-nutrilink database.

we have submitted data security breach notifications with the california office of the attorney general as required by california civil code s.1798.29(e) and s.1798.82(f) and will continue to monitor this issue. while there is no evidence to suggest that your specific data was misused, out of an abundance of caution, we have removed the link to the nutrikids portal from our district website and are awaiting further information from nutrilinks as to the scope of the data that was exposed.

we have no reason to believe that any data was accessed revealing sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information, or other information directly impacting your credit rating. rocklin unified school district does not keep this type of information associated with your nutrikids-nutrilink account. nevertheless, if you suspect your personal information has been misused, visit the federal trade commission's site at identitytheft.gov to get recovery steps and to file an identity theft complaint. your complaint will be added to the ftc's consumer sentinel network, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

for links and more information, please visit www.rocklinusd.org/data-breach. here you will also see updated information on the actions nutrikids-nutrilink is taking to prevent this from happening to our school district and others in the future. if you have any questions, including how to reset your password, please email safedata@rocklinusd.org, and one of our rusd technology services experts will respond and help you in a timely manner.

thank you,

rocklin unified school district	the data breach was caused by a bug in the nutrilink software that allowed unauthorized access to the nutrikids-nutrilink system, which stored student and parent information regarding nutrition services for the rocklin unified school district. this was fixed by nutrilink, and while some student information may have been revealed, no sensitive information such as social security numbers or credit card data was accessed. the breach was caused by an outside party or malware.

we are writing to inform you of a recent incident involving blackbaud, inc. (blackbaud), a third-party vendor that joslin diabetes center (joslin) uses for database assistance in donor relations and fundraising operations. on july 16, 2020, joslin received notification from blackbaud of a cyber incident that blackbaud uncovered in may 2020. the confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care are among our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously.

re: information regarding your account ending in xxxx.

dear [customer name]:

at u.s. bank, we value your confidence in us and place the privacy and security of your information as a top priority. we are writing to let you know about an event that occurred at a u.s. bank location, which included some of your personal information.

what happened:

on july 30, 2020, a computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. since the event, we have been focused on identifying who was impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

what information was involved:

the information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name and account number. at this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you or your account.

what are we doing:

we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. as a precautionary measure, if you would like to receive a new account number, you can do so by calling our fraud liaison center at 877.595.6256 between 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ct, monday through sunday. we can help you close and reopen your account with a new account number at no charge.

what you can do: free fraud alert information

we recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit file. fraud alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. a fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your fraud alert: trans union, equifax, or experian. as soon as the credit reporting company confirms your fraud alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately. the contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is:

you may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze. a fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. a security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts.

contents of data breach notification letter: re: notice of data breach

vermont student assistance corporation (vsac) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect the security of some of your information. on july 16, 2020, vsac received notice that one of its third-party vendors, blackbaud, inc. (blackbaud), suffered a cyber incident. blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that offers customer relationship management and financial services tools to many non-profit organizations, including vsac. while we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we are providing you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect yourself, should you feel it necessary to do so.

what happened?

in may 2020, blackbaud experienced a ransomware incident that impacted certain systems within the blackbaud environment. as a result of this incident, certain blackbaud systems were encrypted and a blackbaud database backup file including vsac data was removed from the blackbaud environment by an unauthorized actor. while blackbaud's investigation was able to determine that the backup file was removed between february 7, 2020, and may 20, 2020, their investigation was unable to confirm exactly when this occurred. as a result, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain information contained within the backup database. upon learning of this incident, vsac immediately began an investigation to determine the full nature and scope of the event and what, if any, vsac data may have been impacted. on or about august 7, 2020, vsac's investigation determined that the backup database may have contained personal information.

what information was involved?

while blackbaud reports that information was accessed, blackbaud was unable to confirm what, if any, specific sensitive information was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor. blackbaud has also represented to us that they have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. regardless, out of an abundance of caution, vsac is notifying you of this incident because you are or were a customer or client of vsac, and information related to you was potentially present in the database at the time of this incident. our investigation determined that the information related to you included your name and social security number. to date, vsac has not received any reports of actual or attempted misuse of your information.

dear sample a sample:

what are we doing?

the confidentiality, privacy, and security of information in our care are one of our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. when we were notified of this incident, we immediately commenced an investigation to determine what vsac data may have been at risk. as part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information in our care, we are working to review our existing policies and procedures regarding our third-party vendors and are working with blackbaud to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future.

we are also notifying state and federal regulators, as	the breach was caused by a ransomware attack suffered by vsac's third-party vendor, blackbaud, resulting in unauthorized access to vsac's data.

notice of data breach

dear [name],

we are writing to inform you about a data breach of your personal health information (phi) from our online covid statistics database.

what happened?
the breach occurred due to unauthorized access into our database by at least one member of the public. we became aware of this breach on july 28, 2020, and as required by law, we are notifying potentially affected individuals as soon as possible while protecting the integrity of the ongoing forensic investigation. although it is unclear whether your personal health information was accessed, we are notifying you of the possibility.

what information was involved?
the unsecured information could include your first and last name, date of birth, gender, race, region in which you live, covid-19 test information, and clinical notes from the time period between april 9, 2020, and july 14, 2020. please note that none of the types of information that typically are used for identity theft (such as social security number, financial account numbers, etc.) was among the information that was potentially accessed.

what we are doing?

dear friend,

we are writing to inform you that blackbaud, one of the league of american orchestras' database vendors, recently notified us of a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. blackbaud has assured us that this breach did not include access to any credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. based on the nature of the incident, their research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, blackbaud concluded that there is no reason to believe that any data was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

despite blackbaud's assurances that there is a very low risk that any of your information could be misused, the league of american orchestras takes the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. we are therefore contacting you to explain the incident and to provide you with additional steps you can take to protect yourself.

what happened:

blackbaud, which works with many nonprofits and educational institutions to support their development and donor engagement activities, recently notified us of a security incident. you may have received a similar email about this incident from other nonprofits or universities whose data blackbaud stewards. at this time, we understand that blackbaud discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. after discovering the attack, blackbaud's cyber security team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, expelled the cybercriminal from their system. blackbaud indicated, however, that the cybercriminal did remove a copy of a backup file containing some of your information before being locked out of the system. a full description of the incident is available on blackbaud's website at https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident.

what information was involved:

the cybercriminal did not access your credit card information, bank account information, or social security number. however, blackbaud has determined that the file removed may have contained personal information, such as your physical and email addresses, telephone numbers, demographic information, and a history of your relationship with our organization, including donation dates and amounts. blackbaud informed us that the company paid the cybercriminal's demand and received confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed. as noted above, blackbaud concluded that there is no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, that the data was or will be misused, or that the data will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

what blackbaud and the league are doing:

the league is notifying you out of an abundance of caution. ensuring the safety of our constituents' data is of the utmost importance to us. blackbaud has assured us of its commitment to prevent future cyber theft, having already implemented several changes to better protect your data. blackbaud's teams were able to quickly identify the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and took swift action to fix it. the company has confirmed through testing by multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, that its fix withstands all known attack tactics. additionally, blackbaud is accelerating their efforts to further harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

what you can do:

although we currently have no reason to believe that your information will be misused, we encourage you to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us, to blackbaud, and to the proper law enforcement authorities. we sincerely apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience it may cause you. should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us by email at securitybreach@americanorchestras.org or by phone at 646-822-4098.

notice of data security incident

we are writing to tell you about a recent data security incident that may have resulted in the unauthorized acquisition of personal information you provided when using our website to make online purchases. we take this matter very seriously because we know how important your personal information is to you. we are providing this notice to you as a precautionary measure, to inform you and to explain steps that you can take to protect your information.

what happened

on august 20, 2020, st. paul center received notice from a payment processing vendor that our website (http://www.stpaulcenter.com) was a common point of purchase for some unauthorized payment card transactions and that there may have been a possible compromise of our website. we investigated to find out what happened, to prevent something like this from happening again, and to provide notice to potentially affected individuals.

we determined that a cyber-criminal installed malware in software that we use to enhance our online purchasing. the malware permitted the unauthorized collection or scraping of certain payment card data provided through the website. we believe the incident only involved customers who made purchases or donations on the website between march 3, 2020, and august 9, 2020. on august 26, 2020, we determined that the incident may have involved your personal information because you made a payment card purchase or donation using our website during that time period.

what information was involved

once we determined that there may have been unauthorized acquisition of payment card information, we reviewed our purchase records to find out who may have been affected and where those people resided. the information may have included your name, address, email address, telephone number, and payment card number, along with the accompanying cvv code, pin or expiration date.

what we are doing about it

when we discovered this incident, our technical experts identified and corrected the issue, effectively closing the point of entry for the website malware. to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we conducted an extensive internal audit to all systems and have implemented more stringent, ongoing processes for identifying and eliminating vulnerabilities. we are also providing notice of this incident to appropriate state regulators, consistent with our compliance obligations and responsibilities.

what you can do

we recommend that you remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft by monitoring your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. report any incidents of suspected identity theft to your local law enforcement and state attorney general. if you believe your payment card information may have been compromised, you should consider contacting your payment card company and/or financial institution and request that the card be canceled. we strongly recommend that you review the information provided at the end of this letter, entitled more information about identity theft and ways to protect yourself and state-specific information.

for more information

if you have any questions or need more information, please call us, toll-free, at 1-888-487-2114, monday through friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. est.

we know that this situation is frustrating to you, and we deeply regret this incident. please know we take your support, and your trust, very seriously. we hope our actions moving forward will demonstrate this.

very truly yours,

anthony puorro, chief financial officer

to date, cedar county has no evidence that any of the information has been misused. nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, cedar county wanted to inform you (and the affected residents) of the incident and to explain the steps it is taking to help safeguard the affected residents against identity fraud. cedar county is providing the affected residents with written notification of this incident commencing on or about october 8, 2020 in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto. cedar county is offering the affected residents whose social security numbers were impacted complimentary one-year memberships with a credit monitoring service. cedar county is advising the affected residents about the process for placing fraud alerts and/or security freezes on their credit files and obtaining free credit reports. the affected residents are also being provided with the contact information for the consumer reporting agencies, the federal trade commission, and the iowa attorney general.

at cedar county, protecting the privacy of personal information is a top priority. cedar county is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information in its possession and has taken many precautions to safeguard it. cedar county continually evaluates and modifies its practices to enhance the security and privacy of the personal information.

dear valued member of the carnival cruise line family,

we are writing to inform you about a recent cyber event that occurred on august 15, 2020. unauthorized third-party access to portions of our information technology systems was detected, and we acted quickly to shut down the intrusion, restore operations, and prevent further unauthorized access. we also engaged a major cybersecurity firm to investigate the matter and notified law enforcement and appropriate regulators of the event.

while the investigation is ongoing, early indications are that in early august an unauthorized third-party gained access to certain personal information relating to some of our guests, employees, and crew. for individuals who sailed with us, the information impacted may include the data routinely collected during the guest travel booking process, during the casino experience, or at the time of employment. that information may include names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and dates of birth. the investigation into the specific data impacted is ongoing, but in some limited instances, we anticipate additional information impacted may include data such as social security numbers, health information, or other personal information.

working with our cybersecurity consultants, we took steps to recover our files and have evidence indicating a low likelihood of the data being misused. we are working as quickly as possible to identify the guests, employees, crew, and other individuals whose information may have been impacted. we expect to complete this process within the next 30-60 days and will then send notifications to potentially affected individuals whose current contact information is available to the company. along with those individual notices, affected individuals will be offered complimentary credit monitoring, as appropriate.

we have issued a news release, posted website notices, and established a dedicated call center to answer questions regarding the event. when the investigation is complete, callers may confirm whether or not their information was affected. additional information about the event is available at www.carnival.com. the call center is available toll-free in the u.s. at +1. 888.905.0687, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. eastern time (et), monday through friday. individuals outside the u.s. may email questions to cruisedataevent@cyberscout.com, and request that a call center representative respond back by phone.

as part of our ongoing operations, we are continuing to review security and privacy policies and procedures and implementing changes when needed to enhance information security and privacy controls.

it is always a good idea to remain vigilant against threats of identity theft or fraud. you can do this by regularly reviewing and monitoring your account statements and credit history for any signs of unauthorized transactions or activity. while we have no reason to suspect that your information is being misused, if you ever suspect that you are the victim of identity theft or fraud, you can contact your local police.

for additional information about how to protect yourself, please visit the resources provided for australian, canadian, u.k., and u.s. residents in the appendices below.

if you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at the u.s. toll-free number +1 888.905.0687 between the hours of 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. eastern time (et), monday through friday. individuals outside the u.s. may email questions to cruisedataevent@cyberscout.com, as well as request that a call center representative respond back by phone.

blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified us that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on blackbaud's network in may 2020. blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince blackbaud to pay a ransom. blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files removed from its systems had been destroyed. the time period of unauthorized access was between february 7 to may 20, 2020. blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

upon learning of the incident from blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the blackbaud services we use and the information provided by blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. on september 8, 2020, we determined that the backup files contained certain information pertaining to you.

terminix and our former affiliate, servicemaster, take the privacy and security of your personal information very seriously, and we strive to maintain transparency in how we handle your data. it is for this reason we are reaching out today.

what happened?

on september 16th, the company discovered that a teammate had responded to a phishing scam, which allowed hackers to gain access to the teammate's office 365 account and cause the teammate's emails to be auto-forwarded from the teammate's inbox to an external email account controlled by the hackers. the auto-forwarding began on september 10th and continued until september 22nd. please note that this breach involved a hack into office 365 at the cloud level and there was no malware or malicious software that infected the company's internal systems.

what information was involved?

our review of compromised emails revealed that one email included a file which contained the name, social security number, date of birth, employment dates, 401k balance, and the name of our 401k provider for 14,708 current and former teammates across the united states. due to the sensitive nature of this information, it is possible that thieves can use it for identity theft. we do not know if the information has been used at this time. we are sending this notice to both terminix and servicemaster teammates because these events took place before the completion of the sale of servicemaster brands, when everyone receiving this notice was employed under the servicemaster global holdings brand.

what we are doing:

we have taken and continue to take a number of actions in response to the breach. we have disabled the forwarding of the emails and contained the breach. we modified our email filtering and account authorization protocol to help prevent similar data breach incidents. we are communicating to our teammates to be sure everyone is especially diligent regarding any potential scams as we continue to fight the battle with these criminals from repeated phishing attacks. we are requiring teammates to complete the annual security awareness training, and we have issued specialized training to particularly high-risk groups to help them recognize extremely sophisticated phishing attempts. we are working with law enforcement agencies to investigate this cybercrime and are notifying state authorities as well. we've notified the provider of our 401k plans and the major credit agencies. we are continuing to monitor the security of our systems and reinforce messages related to the importance of abiding by proper security and data handling measures.

what you can do:

while we currently have no reason to believe any personal information has been misused, for your protection, we have arranged to provide identity theft protection services through id experts, the data breach and recovery services expert at no cost to you for two years. myidcare services include two years of credit and cyberscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. with this protection, myidcare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised.

fraud alert: you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

security freeze: under u.s. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. this will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. in order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

additional free resources: you can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, the ftc, or from your respective state attorney general about fraud alerts, security freezes, and steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. you may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the ftc or to the attorney general in your state.

dear [customer name]:

at u.s. bank, we value your confidence in us and place the privacy and security of your information as a top priority. we are writing to let you know about an event that occurred at a u.s. bank location, which included some of your personal information.

what happened:

on july 30, 2020, a computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. since the event, we have been focused on identifying who may have been impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

what information was involved:

the information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name and account number. at this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you or your account.

what are we doing:

we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. as a precautionary measure, if you would like to receive a new account number, you can do so by calling our fraud liaison center at 877.595.6256 between 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ct, monday through sunday. we can help you close and reopen your account with a new account number at no charge.

what you can do: free fraud alert information

we recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit file. fraud alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. a fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your fraud alert: transunion, equifax, or experian. as soon as the credit reporting company confirms your fraud alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately. the contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is:

if you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. you also should file a complaint with the federal trade commission (ftc) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.id.theft (877.438.4338). your complaint will be added to the ftcs identity theft data clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. also visit the ftcs website at ftc.gov/idtheft to review their free identity theft resources such as their comprehensive step-by-step guide identity theft - a recovery plan.

free credit-security freeze information

you can request a free security freeze (aka credit freeze) on your credit file by contacting each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies via the channels outlined below. when a credit freeze is added to your credit report, third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law will not be able to access your credit report without your consent. a credit freeze can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit.

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam:

we represent timberline billing service, llc (timberline) located at 1801 fuller road west des moines, ia 50265, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to five hundred eighty-seven (587) iowa residents. this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. by providing this notice, timberline does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of iowa law, the applicability of the iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

this notice is being provided to your office by timberline on behalf of the below named entity, as timberline experienced a data event impacting personal information received from and relating to this entity, which is understood to be the data owner of the personal information. the information that may have been impacted by this incident varies by individual and is broken down in relation to each of timberline's customer school districts on behalf of whom this notification is being submitted:

council bluffs community school district, located at 300 w. broadway, suite 1600, council bluffs, ia 51503, has 587 impacted iowa residents. the data involved was name and social security number.

nature of the data event

on march 5, 2020, timberline noticed suspicious activity on its systems. timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. on march 16, 2020, timberline notified its data owner clients that it had experienced a security incident and would provide additional information once more was known, including whether any personal information had been subject to unauthorized access or acquisition.

working with outside computer forensics specialists, timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed the timberline network between february 12, 2020 and march 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also claimed to have removed certain information from the timberline network. however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information on timberline's systems was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor, and the unauthorized actor did not provide proof of the data which they purportedly removed.

therefore, out of an abundance of caution, timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted to identify any sensitive information present relating to its customer school districts and their students or other related individuals. this review was completed on or about june 10, 2020, and determined that protected health information (phi), as defined by hipaa, and/or personally identifiable information (pii) belonging to timberline's customer school districts was present in files that may have been subject to unauthorized access or acquisition. however, for a significant number of impacted individuals, the review was unable to match the individuals' information with the related customer school district to whom the data belonged.

to address this issue, timberline undertook a detailed review of both the source documents in which phi and/or pii identified and its own internal records to identify which school district clients the individuals' information belonged to. on september 2, 2020, timberline provided notice to its impacted customer school districts with which the impacted individuals' information is associated that this information was impacted by the incident. timberline offered to provide notice of the incident and identity protection services to individuals, as well as notice to applicable privacy regulators, on behalf of the school districts. since that time, timberline continues to work diligently to assist all school districts who wish to accept its offer to coordinate the notifications.

notice to iowa residents

on october 20, 2020, timberline mailed written notice of this incident to affected individuals on behalf of its above-named customer school district. the number of affected individuals includes five hundred eighty-seven (587) iowa residents. written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon learning of this incident, timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. timberline reported this incident to law enforcement. timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of the timberline systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place, including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

although there is no indication of misuse of personal information, and timberline was unable to confirm with certainty that data was accessed or acquired by an unauthorized actor, timberline is offering 12 months of complimentary identity monitoring services to impacted individuals through experian. additionally, timberline is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. timberline is providing individuals with information on how to place a	there is no clear information regarding the type of breach that occurred, as the investigation was unable to determine which specific information on timberline's systems was actually accessed or acquired by the unauthorized actor, and it is unknown how the actor gained access to their systems. there is also no clear indication of the nature of unauthorized access or acquisition of data, and whether it was due to hacking, unintentional disclosure, physical loss, or an insider breach. therefore, as it is unclear what type of breach occurred, the breach is classified as unknown.

to whom it may concern:

in accordance with iowa code 715c.1-2, i am writing on behalf of sam's club to notify you of a recent data security issue.

on september 24, 2020, sam's club learned that in the previous week, an unauthorized party used certain members' login credentials (email address and password) to access their sam's club accounts. based on the company's investigation, sam's club believes the credentials the unauthorized party used were stolen from sources unrelated to sam's club and were not obtained from sam's club. the unauthorized party used these stolen credentials to conduct fraudulent transactions involving certain members' sam's club cash rewards.

in addition to the login credentials that were stolen from sources outside of the sam's club environment, the unauthorized party may have accessed certain information in members' accounts, including names, phone numbers, postal addresses, sam's club online membership ids, membership types, cash rewards (balances, amounts earned and spent), and membership expiration dates.

sam's club contacted law enforcement and promptly took a number of steps to protect potentially affected members. within a day of detecting the issue, the company sent emails to these members indicating that sam's club had reset their online passwords due to suspicious activity on their accounts. the company is issuing a new sam's club membership number to certain affected members. in addition, sam's club has implemented certain fraud defense measures with respect to cash rewards balances, including placing a temporary hold on any cash rewards currently in certain members' accounts. the company continues to monitor for suspicious activity and has encouraged affected members to change their passwords for other online accounts (e.g., email, banking or social media) if they used login credentials similar to those that they used for their sam's club membership accounts.

there are approximately 2,616 iowa residents whose cash rewards accounts were affected by this issue. enclosed for your reference is a draft copy of the notification letter being mailed to these individuals, and sam's club has arranged to offer them complimentary identity protection and credit monitoring services.

please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

fraud alerts:

you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

credit and security freezes:

you may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies using the contact information above.

re: << b2b_text_1 (site of care)>> , a member of trinity health:

notice of data breach

at trinity health, safety is a top priority including the safety of our patients and donors personal information. in that regard, we are notifying you about a data security incident involving blackbaud, a vendor that supplies trinity health's donor database technology. the data security incident may have impacted certain personal information of donors and certain patients.

what happened?

on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified trinity health and other customers of a cyber-attack involving blackbaud's network, including ransomware, that impacted certain donor database backup files maintained by blackbaud, including trinity health's donor database. blackbaud reported the cyberattack occurred between april 18, 2020 - may 16, 2020. blackbaud reported that based on its investigation, the cybercriminals responsible for the attack could have obtained access to various types of information in the client backup files.

what we are doing.

upon receiving this notice, trinity health took immediate steps to begin its own investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive trinity health data was potentially impacted. please note that this attack did not occur within the information systems of trinity health or any affiliated ministry. unfortunately, a sophisticated attack against blackbaud circumvented blackbaud's security measures protecting the information in their care leading to this incident. trinity health and its affiliated ministries take security of your information seriously and makes significant investments in the protection of your information to reduce this type of event from occurring. trinity and its affiliated ministries are working with blackbaud to keep this type of event from occurring again.

what information was involved?

our forensic investigation determined that some data fields were encrypted and would not be accessible to the cybercriminals. other fields were not encrypted and could have been accessible to the cybercriminals including information such as: donor relation to patient, patient discharge status, patient insurance and patient department of service. this database information spans from 2000 to 2020.

your personally identifiable information and protected health information data elements that could have been exposed in the cyberattack are: full name, address, phone numbers, email, <<b2b_text_2(impacteddata)>> .

why was patient information in the database?

limited patient information was included for the purposes of the trinity health grateful patient program consistent with the permitted use of limited patient information for fund-raising under hipaa.

how did blackbaud secure the data?

blackbaud reported that they quickly locked out the cybercriminals and resolved the issue. additional details about the security incident is available by visiting blackbaud's website at https://www.blackbaud.com/securityincident, which includes information about blackbaud's steps to ensure this issue does not happen again. we continue to work with blackbaud on the measures they are taking to further secure the information in their care.

we deeply regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any concern or inconvenience you may experience from this notification.

what you can do.

what happened?

blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other nonprofits. on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified us that it had discovered a ransomware attack on blackbaud's network in may 2020. blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince blackbaud to pay a ransom. blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files removed from its network had been destroyed. blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

upon learning of the incident from blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the blackbaud services we use and the information provided by blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. on august 18, 2020, we determined that the backup files contained certain information pertaining to you.

what information was involved?

the backup file involved contained your name and indicated the breast cancer diagnosis that you have provided to us. blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused, disseminated, or otherwise made available publicly.

what you can do.

even though there is no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. for more information, including additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in the following pages.

what we are doing.

we are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that we, and blackbaud, are taking in response. blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based security monitoring.

we regret that this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. should you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at 855-807-6386 or inquiries@lbbc.org.

what we are doing?

ascend internal teams worked diligently with forensic consultants to restore and secure the impacted systems. this included the installation of forensic tools on all systems and the isolation of impacted systems until ascend could confirm that they were secure. ascend also implemented countermeasures and further upgraded its security systems to prevent future incidents such as this from occurring.

4. if you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;

contents of data breach notification letter: dear xxx,

we are writing to inform you that blackbaud, one of our third-party vendors, experienced a ransomware attack between february 7, 2020, and may 20, 2020. the attackers accessed and downloaded files containing information about athenian, some of our alumni, and vendors. blackbaud initially informed us that the information obtained in the attack was encrypted, and our legal counsel determined that athenian did not need to provide notice to the affected individuals since their information was not at risk of being misused.

however, on september 29, 2020, blackbaud provided athenian with an updated notice stating that some of the exposed information was unencrypted. blackbaud believes that your social security number was exposed during the incident because they were storing this information in an old version of the blackbaud software that has since been updated.

despite blackbaud's assurances that the information was destroyed, we are notifying you so that you can take immediate action to protect yourself. to that end, blackbaud is offering identity theft protection services to individuals whose social security numbers were exposed at no cost to you. this service will last for 24 months from the date of enrollment.

in addition to the above steps, blackbaud intends to encrypt all social security number data in its database by the end of october and delete the old, unused data by the end of this year (2020). further, athenian recently instituted a policy of not storing our vendors' social security numbers in blackbaud's systems.

we recommend that you take advantage of the credit monitoring service above and remain vigilant in protecting your identity. promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to law enforcement. you should also obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every twelve months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

if you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me at 925-362-7262 or ltullo@athenian.org. if you have questions regarding the credit monitoring service from cyber scout, please contact them directly at 1-888-682-5911.

on march 5, 2020, timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. working with outside computer forensics specialists, timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed timberlines network between february 12, 2020 and march 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from timberlines network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. this review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

based on the investigation, timberline discovered that the following personally identifiable information (pii) was compromised: individuals name in combination with their medicaid identification number, driver license number and state identification number. to date, timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. number of iowa residents affected.

carlisle csd finished reviewing the list of affected individuals on october 8, 2020 and determined five hundred fifty-four (554) residents were potentially affected. incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on november 2, 2020 via first class mail. a sample copy of the incident notification letter mailed to potentially affected residents of iowa is included with this letter at exhibit a.

3. steps taken.

upon learning of this incident, timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. carlisle csd takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. carlisle csd is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by timberline.

4. contact information.

carlisle csd remains dedicated to protecting its students sensitive personal information. if you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at anjali.das@wilsonelser.com or 312-821-6164.

contents of data breach notification letter: additional steps you can take

we remind you that it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

equifax, po box 740241, atlanta, ga 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
experian, po box 2002, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
transunion, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	the letter does not provide clear information about how the breach occurred or what kind of data was involved, so it is difficult to narrow down the type of breach more accurately.

re: data security incident

dear attorney general miller:

we represent burlington community school district (burlington csd) regarding a data security incident involving timberline billing services, llc (timberline), a company located in iowa. burlington csd is located at 1429 west ave, burlington, iowa. timberline provides medicaid reimbursement billing services for medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in iowa, including burlington csd. burlington csd takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. nature of the incident.

in september 2020, timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by timberline. burlington csd was first notified of this incident by timberline on september 2, 2020. on march 5, 2020, timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. working with outside computer forensics specialists, timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed timberlines network between february 12, 2020 and march 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from timberlines network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. this review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised. based on the investigation, timberline discovered that the following personally identifiable information (pii) was compromised: individuals name in combination with their medicaid identification number, driver license number and state identification number. to date, timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. number of iowa residents affected.

burlington csd finished reviewing the list of affected individuals on october 21, 2020 and determined one thousand eight hundred fifty five (1855) iowa residents were potentially affected. incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on october 30, 2020 via first class mail.

3. steps taken.

upon learning of this incident, timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location. timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. burlington csd takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. burlington csd is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by timberline.

4. contact information.

burlington csd remains dedicated to protecting its students sensitive personal information. if you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at anjali.das@wilsonelser.com or 312-821-6164.

on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified stetson university of a ransomware attack on their internal systems. we immediately launched an investigation with the help of external cybersecurity professionals. blackbaud reported that they identified an attempted ransomware attack on may 20, 2020, and engaged forensic experts and law enforcement to assist in their internal investigation. the investigation concluded that the cybercriminal intermittently removed data from blackbaud's systems between february 7, 2020, and may 20, 2020. the cybercriminal removed a backup file containing certain information, which blackbaud paid to have permanently destroyed.

we discovered on september 4, 2020, that the compromised file may have contained your information. blackbaud has stated that their teams were able to quickly identify the vulnerability associated with this incident and took action to fix it. they have confirmed through testing by multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, that their fix withstands all known attack tactics. additionally, they are accelerating their efforts to further harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

(aeries), a third-party student data management vendor, of a potential data incident affecting aeries school district clients. while aeries indicated it found no evidence to suggest that any data was specifically accessed, that type of activity cannot be ruled out with certainty. aeries also stated that local and federal law enforcement officials were notified of this incident. the notification prompted woodland to immediately launch an investigation into the nature and scope of the event. the investigation determined that personal information residing in our aeries student information system (sis) was potentially subject to unauthorized access on or around november 4, 2019. while we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this information, we undertook a comprehensive review of our aeries sis to confirm the type of information it contained and to whom it related. this review was completed on september 15, 2020, and we determined certain information relating to you resided in our aeries sis in november 2019 and thus was potentially subject to unauthorized access.

what information was involved?

our investigation in this matter confirmed that our aeries sis contained your name, physical address, email address, aeries sis username, and password in hashed form.

what are we doing?

information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. woodland has strict measures in place to protect information in our care. upon learning of this incident, we took steps to determine the contents of our aeries sis which were affected by the aeries incident and identify any potentially impacted individuals. we are also working with aeries to confirm actions they are taking and measures they are putting in place to prevent the reoccurrence of the november 2019 event. additionally, we have reported this incident to state regulators, as required.

what you can do?

please review the enclosed steps you can take to protect your information. we also encourage you to change your aeries sis password.

for more information.

we recognize that you may have questions not addressed in this letter. if you have additional questions, please call our dedicated assistance line at 888-905-0732 (toll-free), monday - friday, 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., pacific time (excluding u.s. national holidays). you may also write to us at 435 6th st, woodland, ca 95695.

steps you can take to protect your information

monitor your accounts

we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. under u.s. law, you are entitled to one (1) free credit report annually from each of the three (3) major credit reporting bureaus. to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. you may also contact the three (3) major credit bureaus listed below directly to request a free copy of your credit report. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

you have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. the security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

notice of data breach

dear xxx,

at methodist hospital of southern california (mhsc), we take our responsibility to maintain the privacy and security of our patients' personal information very seriously. this commitment includes notifying our patients if we believe their information has potentially been subject to disclosure. this letter is to provide you with such notice.

what happened?

the methodist hospital foundation (the foundation) is a nonprofit corporation that is organized to fund charitable funds for the benefit of mhsc.

in accordance with our policies and procedures, and as described in our notice of privacy practices provided to our patients, mhsc provides limited information about our patients to the foundation, which contracts with blackbaud inc., a well-respected provider of cloud and data services for charitable organizations.

on september 9, 2020, we were notified by the foundation that blackbaud discovered and stopped a ransomware attack that included the foundations donor database, as well as those of many other nonprofit organizations. the ransomware attack occurred between february and may 2020, but blackbaud and the foundation took time to determine which organizations were impacted before we were notified of the attack.

in its investigation, blackbaud stated that its cybersecurity team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking blackbaud's system access. blackbaud ultimately expelled the cybercriminal from its system. prior to locking the cybercriminal out, however, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a backup file containing some of the information about you.

blackbaud stated that they paid the ransom and received confirmation that the cybercriminal had destroyed the copy of the data removed from the system.

what information was involved?

the information we had provided to the foundation, which was copied and, presumably, destroyed by the cybercriminal may have included your:

- full name
- contact information, such as telephone numbers, email address, and mailing address
- demographic information, such as date of birth and sex
- medical record number and possibly admission date

we had not provided other health information, such as insurance information or social security number, to the foundation.

based on the nature of the incident, blackbaud's research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, blackbaud has assured us that it has no reason to believe that any data went beyond this cybercriminal or was disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. blackbaud further stated that they have taken additional steps to ensure that the backup file was permanently deleted.

what we are doing

blackbaud has taken several steps in response to this incident. as part of its ongoing efforts to help avoid an event like this from happening in the future, blackbaud has informed us that it has implemented changes to help protect its system from any future incidents. since learning of the issue, blackbaud identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and has taken actions to fix it. additionally, blackbaud is accelerating its efforts to further improve its systems through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and other network-based platforms. as an additional safety measure, blackbaud has indicated that it has hired a third-party team of experts to monitor the dark web for any further misuse of the data.

in response to blackbaud's notification, mhsc initiated a full investigation once the incident was identified and have taken the necessary steps to prevent a similar event from occurring again, including reviewing and minimizing the sensitive data elements that are provided to the foundation and/or blackbaud. in addition, we have reported this incident to the california department of public health.

what you can do

i want to emphasize again that blackbaud has assured us that no social security numbers, credit card, bank account, or other information of that nature was compromised. however, we recommend you remain attentive by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely and reporting any suspicious activities.

we also want to make you aware of some precautions you can take to protect yourself against the possibility of becoming a victim of identity theft. please see the enclosure to learn more about these precautions and services.

i hope this letter provides some assurance regarding this incident and that you will accept our sincere apologies for any undue concern you have experienced as a result of this event. please feel free to contact me at 626-574-3528 if you have any questions or concerns that i may not have addressed.

we look forward to being able to serve you better in the future.

sincerely,

cari toneck, vp, ccro
chief compliance risk officer
methodist hospital of southern california

steps you can take to further protect your information

review your account statements and notify law enforcement of suspicious activity

as a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and monitor free credit reports closely. if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. you also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities (from whom you may be able to obtain a police report).

we also recommend that you regularly review the explanation of benefits statement that you receive from your insurer. if you see any service that you believe you did not receive, please contact your insurer at the number on the statement. you may also want to check for any medical bills that you do not recognize.

keep a copy of this notice for your records in case of future problems with your medical records. you may also want to request a copy of your medical records from your provider, to serve as a baseline.

if you are a california resident, we suggest that you visit the website of the california office of privacy protection at www.privacy.ca.gov to find more information about your medical privacy.

fraud alert

you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above.

security freeze

in some us states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. this will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. if you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency, there may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift, or remove the security freeze. in order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you, including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

additional resources on identity theft

you can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, federal trade commission, or from your respective state attorney general about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft, including information about how to establish fraud alerts or a security freeze on your credit file. you may also report suspected identity theft to the federal trade commission or to the attorney general in your state.

re: data security incident

dear attorney general miller:

we represent saydel community school district (saydel csd) regarding a data security incident involving timberline billing services, llc (timberline), a company located in iowa. saydel csd is located at 5740 ne 14th street, des moines, iowa. timberline provides medicaid reimbursement billing services for medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in iowa, including saydel csd.

saydel csd takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. nature of the incident.

in september 2020, timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by timberline. saydel csd was first notified of this incident by timberline on september 2, 2020.

on march 5, 2020, timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. working with outside computer forensics specialists, timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed timberlines network between february 12, 2020 and march 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from timberlines network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. this review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

based on the investigation, timberline discovered that the following personally identifiable information (pii) was compromised: individuals name in combination with their medicaid identification number, driver license number and state identification number. to date, timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. number of iowa residents affected.

saydel csd finished reviewing the list of affected individuals on october 3, 2020 and determined five hundred seventy seven (577) residents were potentially affected. incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on november 4, 2020 via first class mail.

3. steps taken.

upon learning of this incident, timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. saydel csd takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. saydel csd is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by timberline.

4. contact information.

saydel csd remains dedicated to protecting its students sensitive personal information. if you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at anjali.das@wilsonelser.com or 312-821-6164.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear [customer name],

we are writing to inform you that we have discovered evidence of unauthorized access to some of your personal information. we take the security of your personal information seriously and want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to address the situation.

on october 9, 2020, we were alerted to unusual activity on our website, thenorthface.com, which prompted us to investigate immediately. following a careful investigation, we concluded that a credential stuffing attack had been launched against our website on october 8 and 9, 2020. a credential stuffing attack is a specific type of cybersecurity attack in which the attacker uses account authentication credentials stolen from another source to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

based on our investigation, we believe that the attacker previously gained access to your email address and password from another source (not from the north face) and subsequently used those same credentials to access your account on thenorthface.com. we do not believe that the attacker obtained information from us that would require us to notify you of a data security breach under applicable law, but we are notifying you of the incident voluntarily, out of an abundance of caution.

the information that may have been accessed includes your email address, password, products you have purchased on our website, products you have saved to your favorites, your billing address, your shipping address(es), your vipeak customer loyalty point total, your email preferences, your first and last name, your birthday (if you saved it to your account), and your telephone number (if you saved it to your account). if you saved your payment card (credit, debit or stored value card) to your account on thenorthface.com, the attacker was not able to view your payment card number, expiration date, nor your cvv (the short code on the back of your card), because we do not keep a copy of that information on thenorthface.com.

we have taken steps to address the incident, including implementing measures that limit account logins from sources that we believe are suspicious or in patterns that are suspicious. as a further precaution, we disabled all passwords from accounts that were accessed during the timeframe of the attack. we also erased all payment card tokens from all accounts on thenorthface.com. as such, you will need to create a new (unique) password and enter your payment card information again the next time you shop on thenorthface.com.

we encourage you to take steps to reduce the potential risk of misuse of your online accounts. please change your password at thenorthface.com and at all other sites where you use the same password. we strongly encourage you not to use the same password for your account at thenorthface.com that you use on other websites, because if one of those other websites is breached, your email address and password could be used to access your account at thenorthface.com. in addition, we recommend avoiding using easy-to-guess passwords.

please monitor your financial accounts for any suspicious activity. for more information about steps you can take to reduce the likelihood of identity theft or fraud, call 1-877-id-theft (877-438-4338), visit the ftc's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/, or write to: federal trade commission, 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20580. however, if you believe you are the victim of identity theft, you should immediately contact your local law enforcement agency, your state's attorney general, or the ftc.

we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and want to assure you that the safety of your information on our website is our utmost concern. if you have any questions or concerns, please call us at 1-833-346-5227.

re: data security incident

dear attorney general miller:

we represent clinton community school district (clinton csd) regarding a data security incident involving timberline billing services, llc (timberline), a company located in iowa. clinton csd is located at 1401 12th ave n, clinton, ia 52732. timberline provides medicaid reimbursement billing services for medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in iowa, including clinton csd.

clinton csd takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. nature of the incident.

in september 2020, timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by timberline. clinton csd was first notified of this incident by timberline on september 2, 2020.

on march 5, 2020, timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. working with outside computer forensics specialists, timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed timberline's network between february 12, 2020, and march 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from timberline's network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. this review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

based on the investigation, timberline discovered that the following personally identifiable information (pii) was compromised: individuals name in combination with their medicaid identification number. to date, timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. number of iowa residents affected.

clinton csd determined one thousand six hundred thirty-two (1,632) residents were potentially affected. incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on october 20, 2020, via first class mail. a sample copy of the incident notification letter mailed to potentially affected residents of iowa is included with this letter at exhibit a.

3. steps taken.

upon learning of this incident, timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. clinton csd takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students' information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. clinton csd is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by timberline.

4. contact information.

clinton csd remains dedicated to protecting its students' sensitive personal information. if you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at anjali.das@wilsonelser.com or 312-821-6164.

very truly yours,

wilson elser moskowitz edelman & dicker llp

re: important security breach notification - please read this entire letter.

dear [individual name]:

we are contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred on august 25, 2020 at cantella & co., inc. this incident involved email threads which were used to entice recipients to open an attachment containing malware. malware is a term used to describe any kind of computer software with malicious intent. recipients of these malicious emails opened the attachments, believing them to be from a credible source, which in turn installed the malware. unfortunately, this malware is very difficult to detect, and almost none of the virus scanners available out there today are able to do so. in total, we identified 23 infected computers across our organization. regrettably, some of your personal information may have been contained within these infected computers as many of the emails were internal and therefore deemed to be secure. if you are an entity client, this may include your authorized persons personal information. it is important to note that we have no evidence to support any attempts to misuse private client information thus far, but there is a possibility that your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information may have been potentially exposed to others.

we value your business and respect the privacy of your information. as such, we are providing you with complimentary credit monitoring for the next two years and we ask that you enroll by following the steps outline below. if you are the victim of identity theft, you can file a police report and obtain a copy of it. you may also place a security freeze on your credit reports, free of charge.

a security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumers credit report without written authorization. however, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing or other services. under federal law, you cannot be charged to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. you must place your request for a freeze with each of the three major consumer reporting agencies: equifax (www.equifax.com); experian (www.experian.com); and transunion (www.transunion.com).

to place a security freeze on your credit report, you may send a written request by regular, certified or overnight mail at the addresses below. you may also place a security freeze through each of the consumer reporting agencies websites or over the phone, using the contact information below:

equifax security freeze
p.o. box 105788

woodlyn, pa 19094
1-888-909-8872

in order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide some or all of the following information to the credit reporting agency, depending on whether you do so online, by phone, or by mail:

1. your full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);
2. social security number;
3. date of birth;
4. if you have moved in the past five (5) years, the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. proof of current address, such as a current utility bill, telephone bill, rental agreement, or deed;
6. a legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state drivers license or id card, military identification, u.s. passport etc.);
7. social security card, pay stub, or w2;
8. if you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

the credit reporting agencies have one (1) to three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security freeze on your credit report, based upon the method of your request. the credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (pin) or password (or both) that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. it is important to maintain this pin/password in a secure place, as you will need it to lift or remove the security freeze.

to lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, you must make a request to each of the credit reporting agencies by mail, through their website, or by phone (using the contact information above). you must provide proper identification (including name, address, and social security number) and the pin number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze, as well as the identities of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report. you may also temporarily lift a security freeze for a specified period of time rather than for a specific entity or individual, using the same contact information above. the credit bureaus have between one (1) hour (for requests made online) and three (3) business	the breach was caused by malware contained in email attachments designed to entice recipients to open it, resulting in the installation of the malware on the network, affecting 23 computers in the organization.

re: notice of data breach

dear <<first name>> <<last name>>,

we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. at barristerbooks, we take the privacy and security of your information very seriously. this is why we are notifying you of the incident and informing you about steps you can take to help protect your personal information.

what happened?

we recently discovered a data security incident involving our website. we immediately launched an investigation and engaged a digital forensics firm to assist. the recently completed investigation determined that payment card information may have been exposed for customers who made purchases through barristerbooks.com, lawbooks.com, or lawbooksforless.com between july 7, 2020, and september 11, 2020.

as a small, family-owned company serving law students since 1999, we have always taken the privacy and security of your information extremely seriously. we have never stored full card payment information in our customer accounts or servers and have always strived to maintain a high degree of security. despite our protective measures, it appears that an unknown party was able to obtain payment card information at the time of order placement during the approximate eight-week period mentioned above.

what information was involved?

the information involved in this incident may have included your name and the account number, expiration date, and card value verification number for your payment card ending in <<field 1>>.

what are we doing?

as soon as we detected a potential incident, we took the steps described above and worked to determine whether any personal information was accessed or acquired without authorization. as part of this incident, we have notified the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) regarding the incident and will provide law enforcement whatever assistance is needed. we have adopted even more stringent security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, including moving our card payment processing outside of our website so that order payments are processed directly on paypal. once we were able to determine the dates, we immediately began the process of notifying any customer who may have been affected, and we are now providing you with information about steps you can take to help protect your personal information.

what you can do:

you should remain vigilant by closely reviewing your account statements for discrepancies. we recommend that you report any such discrepancies to your financial institution, which may be able to offer you a new payment card. you can also review the information on the following page for additional steps you can take to protect your personal information, which include placing a fraud alert on your credit report and a security freeze on your credit file.

for more information:

further information about how to protect your personal information appears on the following page. if you have questions concerning this incident, please call (833) 791-1656 monday-friday (excluding holidays) from 9 am - 9 pm eastern time.

for over 20 years, barristerbooks has valued each customer we have been fortunate enough to serve, and your trust is of the utmost importance to us. we fully understand the inconvenience and frustration this situation involves. as such, we sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding during what we realize is already a stressful time, and we deeply regret any worry or inconvenience that this incident may cause you.

sincerely,

barristerbooks, inc.

steps you can take to further protect your information

review your account statements and notify law enforcement of suspicious activity:

as a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. you also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the federal trade commission (ftc).

security freeze:

under u.s. law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. this will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. in order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

based on the investigation, timberline discovered that the following personally identifiable information (pii) was compromised: individuals name in combination with their medicaid identification number and/or drivers license number. to date, timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

3. steps taken.

upon learning of this incident, timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location. timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. bondurant farrar csd takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students' information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. bondurant farrar csd is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by timberline.

we regret to inform you that 1919 investment counsel recently experienced a security incident that may have impacted some of our current and former employees' personal information. we take the responsibility of protecting our employees' personal information extremely seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any concern this incident may cause.

what happened?

on september 21, 2020, a 1919ic employee discovered some unusual activity on their 1919ic work computer. we immediately began investigating and retained a third-party forensic expert to assist. during our investigation, we learned that an unauthorized user gained access to 1919ic's computer systems, which are operated by a third-party managed it services firm with oversight by 1919ic's internal technology team. during the forensic analysis, 1919ic was able to quickly take steps to prevent further unauthorized access and secure our systems. at this time, we do not have any indication that your information was accessed or misused. however, because we deeply value you and are committed to transparency, we wanted to make you aware of this incident.

what information was involved?

the information we hold about our current and former employees may include one or more of the following: name, address, social security number, photo id, birthdate, bank account information, payroll information, and contact information. while we have no evidence that any of this information was viewed by the unauthorized user, we are notifying you because we cannot conclusively rule out that possibility.

what we are doing

re: data security incident

dear attorney general miller:

we represent indianola community school district (indianola csd) regarding a data security incident involving timberline billing services, llc (timberline), a company located in iowa. indianola csd is located at 1301 east second avenue, indianola, ia 50125. timberline provides medicaid reimbursement billing services for medicaid eligible students on behalf of 190 school districts in iowa, including indianola csd.

indianola csd takes the security and privacy of the information in its control seriously, and is working with timberline to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring in the future.

1. nature of the incident.

in september 2020, timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by timberline. indianola csd was first notified of this incident by timberline on september 2, 2020.

on march 5, 2020, timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. working with outside computer forensics specialists, timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed timberlines network between february 12, 2020 and march 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from timberlines network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. this review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised.

based on the investigation, timberline discovered that the following personally identifiable information (pii) was compromised: individuals name in combination with their medicaid identification number, drivers license number, and / or social security number. to date, timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. number of iowa residents affected.

on october 4, 2020, indianola csd finished identifying a population of one thousand, one hundred twenty-six (1126) iowa residents that were potentially affected. incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on november 9, 2020 via first class mail.

3. steps taken.

upon learning of this incident, timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location.

timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. indianola csd takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. indianola csd is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by timberline.

4. contact information.

indianola csd remains dedicated to protecting its students sensitive personal information. if you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at anjali.das@wilsonelser.com or 312-821-6164.

other

if you suspect that someone has stolen or misused your personal information or that you are a victim of identity theft, you should immediately report the incident to your local law enforcement.	although the notification letter mentions a data security incident related to international cosmetics & perfumes, it does not directly relate to the glenwood community school district or timberline billing service llc. the letter might have been sent to individuals who might have had some association with international cosmetics, therefore it is difficult to determine the type of breach for this specific organization based on the information given.

in september 2020, timberline notified approximately 190 school districts that timberline experienced a cybersecurity incident which resulted in the exposure of personal information maintained by educational institutions and processed by timberline. glenwood csd was first notified of this incident by timberline on september 2, 2020. on march 5, 2020, timberline noticed suspicious activity on its network impacting certain servers and systems. timberline launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity. working with outside computer forensics specialists, timberline determined that an unknown actor accessed timberlines network between february 12, 2020 and march 4, 2020, encrypted certain files, and also removed certain information from timberlines network; however, the investigation was unable to determine which specific information was actually removed. therefore, out of an abundance of caution, timberline undertook a comprehensive and time-intensive review of all files that could have been impacted. this review was recently completed and determined that protected health information and/or personal information relating to your child was present in files that may have been compromised. based on the investigation, timberline discovered that the following personally identifiable information (pii) was compromised: individuals name in combination with their medicaid identification number and/or social security number. to date, timberline is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident.

2. number of iowa residents affected.

on october 15, 2020, glenwood csd finished identifying a population of four hundred fifty-eight (458) residents that were potentially affected. incident notification letters addressed to those individuals were mailed on november 13, 2020 via first class mail. a sample copy of the incident notification letter mailed to potentially affected residents of iowa is included with this letter at exhibit a.

3. steps taken.

upon learning of this incident, timberline moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of relevant timberline systems, and identify potentially affected individuals. timberline also reported this incident to law enforcement. timberline is taking steps to enhance the security of its systems in addition to the robust security measures already in place including upgrading all servers and firewalls, resetting all user passwords and requiring frequent password rotations, and migrating school and student data to a cloud location. timberline is also offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for twelve months to affected residents. glenwood csd takes the security, privacy, and confidentiality of its students information very seriously and is encouraging its students to remain vigilant in response to this incident. glenwood csd is also encouraging its students to enroll in the complimentary credit monitoring services being provided by timberline.

what happened?

on october 2, 2020, backroads became aware of suspicious activity within its computer network. backroads immediately began an investigation, working with external forensic specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the activity. our investigation determined that certain files within our environment were encrypted and inaccessible. on october 16, 2020, we discovered that certain files had been accessible to unknown actors and that certain personal information was contained in these files. we recognize that it may feel like there was a delay between the initial incident and receiving this notification. from the moment we knew that files were accessible to the unknown actors, we have been working both internally to determine who could have been affected, as well as externally with appropriate authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate globally. thank you for your understanding and patience while we worked through all the necessary details.

what information was involved?

backroads has both legal authority and obligation to maintain personal information for its employees. the forensic investigation confirmed that the following information was stored within one of the impacted network devices and may have been accessible to unknown actors: your name, date of birth, social security number, government issued id (passport or drivers license, if provided to backroads), financial account information and health insurance information, if obtained through backroads. while we cannot confirm which piece of your personal information might have been accessed, we are informing employees of the full scope of what could have been compromised due to its presence in impacted files.

what we are doing.

the confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information within our custody is among backroads highest priorities. in order to minimize the chance that latent malware could remain on backroads systems, we are rebuilding our network from the ground up, and adding further security measures, to better protect against similar incidents in the future.

recommended steps to help protect your information

1. telephone. contact idx at 1-833-905-3232 to gain additional information about this event.

2. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

3. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

credit bureaus
equifax fraud reporting

p.o. box 2000
chester, pa 19022-2000

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year.

please note: no one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

4. security freeze. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. there is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

subject: notice of data breach

dear <<first name>> <<last name>>:

we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have involved your personal information. the privacy and security of the personal information of the individuals we serve is extremely important to golden gate regional center (ggrc). that is why we are writing to inform you about this incident, offer complimentary identity monitoring and protection services, and provide you with information relating to steps that can be taken to help protect the information of individuals we serve.

what happened?

on september 23, 2020, ggrc detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity's network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity's files, making them inaccessible. the unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity's files. once ggrc discovered this incident, ggrc disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. ggrc also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. based on preliminary findings of the computer forensics firm, it was determined on october 5, 2020, that certain information belonging to the individuals we serve was acquired by an unknown actor.

while we have no evidence that any personal or protected health information belonging to the individuals we serve has been misused, out of an abundance of caution, we are informing you of the incident and providing you with access to complimentary identity monitoring and protection services from idx.

what information was involved?

the types of information impacted may include your <<variable text insert data elements>>.

what are we doing?

as soon as ggrc discovered the incident, we took the steps described above. we have also taken measures to further enhance the security of information in our possession and to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. in addition, we have notified the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) about this incident, and we will work with and provide assistance to law enforcement to hold the perpetrators accountable.

what happened

blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified us that it had discovered a ransomware attack on blackbaud's network in may 2020. blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince blackbaud to pay a ransom. blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement. upon learning of the incident from blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the blackbaud services we use and the information provided by blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. on september 2, 2020, we determined that the backup files contained certain information pertaining to you.

what information was involved

the backup file involved contained your name and social security number. blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

what you can do

even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. as an added precaution, we have secured the services of kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. your identity monitoring services include credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. for more information on identity theft prevention and your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

what we are doing

we are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that blackbaud is taking in response. blackbaud has informed us that it identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and is undertaking additional efforts to harden its environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

for more information

we regret that this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. should you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us at 323-651-0707.

university of minnesota physicians (umphysicians) is writing to make you aware of a data security event that potentially affected the confidentiality of some of your personal information. we have no evidence to suggest that your information was actually viewed during this event and we are not aware of any attempted or actual misuse of your information. however, we are providing you with information about the event, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it is necessary to do so.

what happened?

umphysicians identified that cyber attackers used phishing emails to fraudulently access two employee email accounts. the two phishing email attacks were identified on january 31, 2020 and february 4, 2020, shortly after they occurred. umphysicians took immediate steps to secure the email accounts and began working with third-party computer forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incidents. the investigation indicated that an unknown actor had access to one employee email account on january 30 and january 31, 2020, and another employee email account on february 4, 2020, for a brief period of time.

unfortunately, the investigation was unable to determine with certainty to what extent any emails within the two email accounts may have been viewed by the cyber attackers. based on this, in an abundance of caution, we worked with third-party specialists to perform a comprehensive review of all information stored in the email accounts at the time of the incidents to identify any personal information present in the email accounts. the employee email accounts contained information about individuals because the email accounts were used to perform normal business operations related to health care services provided by umphysicians. upon completion of the third-party specialists review of the full contents of the email accounts, which was a detailed and lengthy process that involved multiple steps to identify the relevant data, we immediately began assessing the results to confirm the identities of potentially affected individuals and obtain their current mailing addresses or other contact information. we recently completed this comprehensive review process.

what information was involved?

our review determined that an email message containing the following types of information relating to you was present in an affected email account during this incident: <<b2b_text_1 (data impacted)>>. we have no evidence indicating that your information was actually viewed during the incident or has been copied or otherwise misused. however, the perpetrators did have access to the two email accounts for a limited period of time so it is possible they may have seen some of your information.

what we are doing.

umphysicians takes this incident and the security of the information in its care very seriously. we quickly identified the attacks and took steps to secure the affected email accounts. at the time of the attacks, umphysicians had multiple email security controls in place, including multi-factor authentication. we also require all employees to participate in privacy and security training, and we regularly conduct exercises to try to make sure personnel do not fall prey to phishing and related scams. as part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy and security of personal information in our care, we reviewed our policies and procedures and implemented additional safeguards to further control and secure the information in our email system. for example, we conducted refresher training for personnel related to best practices in identifying phishing attempts, and we implemented restrictions on email retention. we also purchased additional technology that will provide for more enhanced detection and prevention of phishing emails. in addition, we notified state and federal regulators where we are required to do so. further, while we are unaware of any misuse of your information as a result of this incident, we are offering you access to complimentary identity monitoring services for 12 months through kroll.

fairchild medical center (fmc) is notifying you of an event that may affect the security of some of your personal information. while, to date, we have no evidence that your information has been misused, we are providing you with information about the event, our response to it, and resources available to you to help protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

what happened?

in late july 2020, fmc was made aware of an issue involving a misconfiguration on one of its servers through a communication from a third-party security company unaffiliated with fmc. fmc immediately commenced an investigation and began working with third-party computer specialists to determine the nature and scope of the issue. fmc also immediately addressed the misconfiguration and took steps to secure the server. a third-party security company verified that the server security change resolved the issue. through the investigation, fmc determined that a misconfiguration existed from approximately december 16, 2015, to july 31, 2020, that allowed external individual(s) access to the server. on november 5, 2020, following an extensive review of forensic evidence associated with the server, fmc's investigation determined that it could not conclusively rule out unauthorized access to records present on the server during the window of time when the misconfiguration was in place. as such, out of an abundance of caution, fmc reviewed the server to determine what records were present during that window. while the investigation did not confirm that your record was specifically accessed without authorization, in an abundance of caution, fmc is providing you with notice of this incident because your record was present on the server.

what information was involved?

the information contained on the server includes a medical image, your name, date of birth, patient identification number, exam identification number, the ordering provider, and the date of the exam. please note, this incident did not affect your full medical record. additionally, this incident did not affect your social security number, nor your financial information.

what is fmc doing?

information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. fmc has strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. upon learning of this incident, we moved quickly to respond. this included conducting an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists and engaging in steps to ensure the security of the one affected server. the security change of the server was verified by a third-party security firm to confirm resolution of the server security issue.

what can you do?

we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements and explanation of benefits, and to monitor your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. please review the information contained in the attached steps you can take to protect personal information.

dear sir or madam:

we represent insurance audit services, inc., 214 west 35th street, davenport, ia 52806 (ias). pursuant to iowa code ann. 715c.2, we write to notify you of an incident that affects the security of information relating to 5,997 iowa residents. at this point, we are not aware of any losses or harm arising from the incident. by providing this notice, ias does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of iowa law or personal jurisdiction.

ias is a leading provider of premium audit services and solutions to the p&c insurance industry. on behalf of its commercial carrier clients, ias audits the commercial insurance policies of thousands of businesses nationwide. in the course of those audits, ias collects information from its carrier clients and their policyholders.

on october 28, 2020, attackers deployed a ransomware attack in ias's network. immediately after discovering the attack on the morning of october 28, ias retained legal counsel and engaged a computer forensics firm to investigate and determine the scope of the attack. ias also notified law enforcement and is cooperating with an investigation. on november 6, 2020, ias's forensics team identified evidence consistent with exfiltration of data. on november 10, 2020, ias completed its analysis of the data that we believe may have been compromised to identify those impacted by the incident. in consultation with ias's legal and forensics teams, ias paid the ransom that the attackers demanded and received the keys needed to decrypt its network, details regarding any information the attackers copied from its network, and confirmation that they had deleted any such data.

it appears that data belonging to ias employees and audited policyholders in iowa was exfiltrated from ias's network. with respect to ias employees, the impacted data included copies of employees' irs forms 1095-c, which contain names, addresses, and social security numbers. with respect to audited policyholders, the impacted data may have included the policyholders' business names, business addresses, phone numbers, insurance policy numbers, federal employer identification numbers (fein), and ias-generated usernames and one-time-use initial passwords to an ias file transfer portal. in some cases, the impacted feins may have been social security numbers.

pursuant to iowa code ann. 715c.2, ias is providing notice to 48 employees and 5,949 policyholders in iowa. ias notified its employees of the incident by e-mail on november 12, 2020, and is in the process of sending a follow-up letter to those employees. ias is also in the process of disclosing this security incident by letter to all impacted policyholders in this state. notices will be mailed on november 30, 2020. this notice has not been delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

after a thorough analysis and investigation into the attack, ias believes that the risk of harm to consumers is low. ias paid the ransom the attackers demanded and received confirmation that any data exfiltrated from ias's network had been deleted. moreover, the policyholders whose feins were impacted by this incident are nearly all commercial entities. as such, much of the impacted feins were true feins, rather than social security numbers. as to those consumers, the risk is even further reduced, and the impacted data does not qualify as personal information. iowa code ann. 715c.1(11)(a) (defining personal information with no mention of business information in definition). ias is choosing to disclose to those policyholders because of its inability to determine with certainty that the impacted feins are not social security numbers. nonetheless, and out of an abundance of	the breach was caused by a ransomware attack in ias's network, which was discovered on october 28, 2020. ias retained legal counsel and engaged a computer forensics firm to investigate and determine the scope of the attack, and found evidence consistent with exfiltration of data on november 6, 2020. ias's forensics team identified that data belonging to ias employees and audited policyholders in iowa was exfiltrated from ias's network.

notice of data breach

what happened?
between 2019-04-26 and 2020-11-22, the email address and date of birth (when present) of the user who wrote the latest annotation for any given musicbrainz entity were available on a json block in the source of the entity page. we investigated our database to determine which users were affected. your email address and date of birth, if you entered it, were temporarily available on our web page. the data was never displayed on the page in a human visible way -- it was embedded in the web page source as json. the page source can be viewed with view source on your web browser. we know some of the email addresses were found by spammers, but some affected editors seem to not have received any spam emails. as such, we cannot be sure whether any specific editor's data was actually seen by anyone, but the possibility existed.

what information was involved?
email addresses and birth dates (when present). no other private information was leaked.

what we are doing.
we fixed the breaching code as soon as we found it, audited all of our code to make sure this was the only place where a leak was happening, and are currently hard at work adding additional checks that will warn us (and notify us of an error) if any private user data can be found on the source for a musicbrainz page again.

what you can do
you shouldn't need to do anything - the data is no longer being leaked and no passwords were leaked so you do not need to change your password.

other important information.
a more detailed explanation can be found at our blog post that originally disclosed the issue. if 500 citizens of the state of california had their data leaked, we would be required by law to notify the state of the breach. we cannot know for certain if 500 citizens of california were involved in this breach, since we do not know where our users live. furthermore, email addresses and dates of birth do not seem to be covered by the requirement to file a notice, unless accompanied by passwords, which did not leak in this case. however, we are still notifying the state of california about this breach, as a precautionary measure, even though we do not believe that we are required to do so.

for more information
if you have a specific question not covered here nor on the blog post, don't hesitate to write to us at support@metabrainz.org.

re: notice of data breach

dear <<first name>> <<last name>>,

we are contacting you to inform you of a data incident experienced by a third-party vendor for cathedral catholic high school (cchs, school) that involved your personal information. to provide peace of mind, the vendor is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services.

blackbaud inc. is an international provider of fundraising and financial software for charitable and nonprofit organizations, which hosts a variety of databases for cchs. on sept. 29, 2020, blackbaud notified us that a security incident the company detected in may included several school files containing sensitive personal information. cchs requested information detailing which of our constituents information may have been compromised. we received that information and after additional analyses are sharing it with you today.

this incident involved information stored in files more than 15 years ago in certain blackbaud solution back-ups. the sensitive personal information potentially exposed included your name, address, phone number, and social security number. according to blackbaud, the information was exposed because certain legacy files on its servers were not destroyed or encrypted after the company migrated school files to a new platform. until sept. 29, 2020, blackbaud had assured us that all sensitive personal information was encrypted. blackbaud's recent disclosure follows its initial announcement in july 2020 of the data incident.

what you can do:

to help you guard against potential identity theft or other fraud as a result of this incident, blackbaud is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services for 24 months provided that you register within 90 days of the date of this letter. information about how to access these services accompanies this letter. although services are available to you, it is important to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspected fraud to law enforcement. for information on avoiding identity theft, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

we recently discovered suspicious activity related to certain employee email accounts. we immediately took steps to secure the email accounts and launched an investigation which included working with a third-party forensic investigator to determine the nature and scope of the activity. the investigation determined that email accounts belonging to our employees were subject to unauthorized access on separate occasions between march 2, 2020, and april 30, 2020. as a result, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain emails and attachments within the accounts.

what information was involved?

the investigation was unable to identify all emails or attachments in the accounts that the unauthorized individual may have accessed or acquired. therefore, in an abundance of caution, we notified [company name] of this incident and conducted a review of the entire contents of the email accounts for emails or attachments that contain personal information. this review was completed on september 1, 2020, and we are notifying you of this incident because the investigation confirmed that the accounts may have contained your [variable text field]. to date, we have not received any reports of actual or attempted misuse of your information.

contents of data breach notification letter: subject: notice of unauthorized access to glofox data

dear glofox admin,

we regret to inform you that an unknown third party gained unauthorized access to certain data related to glofox users. we are currently conducting a thorough investigation and want to inform you as soon as possible.

what happened?

on november 14th, we discovered that an unknown third party had accessed some user data, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, hashed/scrambled passwords, and other optional information such as date of birth. no plain text passwords were exposed. the user data was from an archive of information dated march 27th, 2020. no data collected after that date was accessed. we can confirm that no credit card or payment method data was accessed. we do not store any of this information in our systems as part of our standard security measures. we can confirm that x of your clients were impacted. y% of these had a password in glofox. z% of these had a date of birth in glofox. we have identified and closed the path that led to the unauthorized access.

what should glofox administrators do now?

we have reset your glofox account password and the passwords related to your staff to prevent unauthorized access to your account. you and your staff will need to follow the glofox forgot password flow the next time you log in. even though no plain text passwords have been exposed, as a precaution, if you or your staff use your glofox password on other websites, we recommend that you change these passwords. we ask that you pass this recommendation onto your staff.

do you need to inform your members?

we do not believe that the overall risk associated with your members' data is high. however, you may decide to notify your members. if you decide to do so, here is a suggested message you can send them:

hi <first name>,

what we are doing?

dear john doe,

at u.s. bank, we prioritize the privacy and security of your information. we are writing to inform you of an event that occurred at a u.s. bank location, which included some personal information that you, a related person, or related business client shared with us during an application process or as a result of a prior u.s. bank acquisition. the information may be several years old, dating back 10 years or more.

what happened:
on july 30, 2020, a computer server containing your information was physically stolen from one of our corporate offices. since the event, we have been focused on identifying who may have been impacted and working with authorities to recover the stolen server.

what information was involved:
the information on the server included personally identifiable information including your name and social security number. at this time, we are not aware of the information being used fraudulently against you.

what are we doing:
we want to let you know of some steps we have taken to protect you and some additional steps you can take to help protect yourself.

free credit monitoring and identity restoration services
to help you protect your identity, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (mytrueidentity) for two years provided by transunion interactive, a subsidiary of transunion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to enroll in this service, go to the mytrueidentity website at mytrueidentity.com and in the space referenced as enter activation code, enter the following 12-letter activation code and follow the three steps to receive your credit monitoring service online within minutes.

unique activation code: 123456789012

once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain an initial 3-in-1 credit report and credit scores along with two years of unlimited access to your transunion credit report and vantagescore credit score by transunion. the daily three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at transunion, experian and equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address and more. the service also includes dark web internet identity monitoring, the ability to lock and unlock your transunion credit report, access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (certain policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft, please call the transunion fraud response services toll-free hotline at 855.288.5422. when prompted, enter the following 6-digit telephone pass code 698500 to speak to a transunion representative about your identity theft issue.

you can sign up for the mytrueidentity online credit monitoring anytime between now and march 30, 2021. due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with transunion, experian and equifax or an address in the united states (or its territories) and a valid social security number, or are under the age of 18. enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

what you can do: free fraud alert information
whether or not you enroll in credit monitoring, we recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit file. fraud alert messages notify potential credit grantors to verify your identification before extending credit in your name in case someone is using your information without your consent. a fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name; however, please be aware that it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. call only one of the following three nationwide credit reporting companies to place your fraud alert: transunion, equifax, or experian. as soon as the credit reporting company confirms your fraud alert, they will also forward your alert request to the other two nationwide credit reporting companies so you do not need to contact each of them separately.

the contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is:

even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the federal trade commission (ftc) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

if you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. get a copy of the report; many creditors want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. you also should file a complaint with the federal trade commission (ftc) at identitytheft.gov or at 877.id.theft (877.438.4338). your complaint will be added to the ftcs identity theft data clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations. also visit the ftcs website at ftc.gov/idtheft to review their free identity theft resources such as their comprehensive step-by-step guide identity theft - a recovery plan.

what happened

on may 7, 2020, robie & matthai, apc (the firm) was the victim of a ransomware attack. we were able to recover our information from offline backups with no significant interruption in service. after a third-party forensic analysis, however, we determined that the individual(s) who carried out this attack (the attacker) may have accessed some of the personal information on our system. you are receiving this notice because we believe your personal information may have been included among that data set.

what information was involved

after careful review, we have determined that your <<affected data string>> may have been accessed by the attacker.

what we are doing

we had reasonable security measures in place prior to the attack, but have implemented all additional safeguards recommended by our third-party forensic consultants in order to prevent similar attacks in the future. in addition, we are offering identity theft protection services through id x at no cost to you. idx services include: <<12/24>> months of credit and cyberscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. with this protection, idx will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised.

what you can do

we have no evidence to suggest that your information has been misused at this time, but we encourage you to take full advantage of the identity theft protection services described above. you can contact idx and enroll by calling 1-800-939-4170 or going to https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect and using the enrollment code provided above. idx experts are available monday through friday from 6 am - 6 pm pacific time. please note the deadline to enroll is february 16, 2021. we have also included additional information in the recommended steps below with contact information for the three major credit bureaus and select government agencies.

kyle kveton
robie & matthai, apc

enrollment code: <<xxxxxxxx>>

recommended steps to help protect your information

1. website and enrollment. go to https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your enrollment code provided at the top of the letter.

2. activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your idx identity protection membership. the monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. note: you must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. if you need assistance, idx will be able to assist you.

3. telephone. contact idx at 1-800-939-4170 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. if you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in idx, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the idx website and filing a request for help.

if you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our id care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. in the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an id care specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you may need to prove that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone or via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

credit bureaus
equifax fraud reporting

transunion fraud reporting
1-800-680-7289
p.o. box 2000
chester, pa 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year.

please note: no one can place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. security freeze. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. there is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. you can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. the federal trade commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.

dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

sonoma valley hospital (svh) places a high priority on safeguarding your personal and health information. we regret to inform you that svh recently suffered a ransomware attack, which resulted in potential disclosure of certain patient health information to an unauthorized third party. we are contacting you personally to explain the circumstances of the incident.

what happened?

svh experienced a ransomware cyberattack on october 11, 2020, by what is believed to be a russian threat actor. this event was part of a broader attack on dozens of hospitals across the country. we discovered the attack on that same day and immediately responded by shutting down all systems to contain the damage. we promptly notified law enforcement of the incident and engaged a leading external cybersecurity firm to assess the potential disclosure of protected health information. in a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. after discovering the attack, our cybersecurity team, in partnership with outside information technology and forensics experts, successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and ultimately expelled them from our system. as recommended, svh did not pay ransom.

what information was involved?

a thorough forensic investigation determined that information that may have been compromised includes health claims data sent to insurers electronically, including patient name, address, birthdate, insurer group number and subscriber number, as well as diagnosis or procedure codes, date of service, place of service, amount of claim, and secondary payer information. if, and only if, you received imaging services or your service resulted in a grievance, appeal, or quality review, certain additional medical record data such as imaging tests or other may have been disclosed. based on the reports of the forensics analysts, patient financial information (such as credit card or social security number) was neither accessed nor disclosed. svh is not aware of any misuse or attempted misuse of patient health information, and our forensics experts have searched for any potential redisclosures.

what we are doing.

we deeply regret the incident and the concern it has caused to our employees. in response, we activated a series of enhanced security measures to improve information security and prevent further ransomware or cybersecurity attacks.

what you can do.

please review the enclosed additional resources section included with this letter. this section describes additional steps you can take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the federal trade commission regarding identity theft protection. if you have questions, please call 1-877-374-2465 monday through friday from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. central time (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. pacific time).

we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. eyemed, who manages vision benefits on behalf of your <<b2b_text_2 (carrier or name of covered entity)>>, takes the privacy and confidentiality of your information very seriously.

on july 1, 2020, eyemed discovered that an unauthorized individual gained access to an eyemed email mailbox and sent phishing emails to email addresses contained in the mailbox's address book. on the same day, eyemed took immediate action to block the unauthorized individual's access to the mailbox and secured the mailbox. eyemed immediately launched an investigation into the incident and engaged a cybersecurity firm to assist in its efforts. it was determined that the unauthorized individual first gained access to the mailbox on june 24, 2020, and that access terminated on july 1, 2020.

the mailbox contained information about individuals who formerly or currently receive vision benefits through eyemed. although eyemed could not fully determine whether, and to what extent, if any, the unauthorized individual viewed or copied personal information, it is possible that personal information was viewed or acquired by the unauthorized individual.

following a detailed analysis and review of all potentially compromised emails and files, eyemed identified the names of all individuals who were impacted, as well as the type of information included in those files. personal information that may have been accessed could include the following types of information: <<b2b_text_3 (impacted data)>><<b2b_text_4 (impacted data)>>.

eyemed is committed to safeguarding your personal information and has taken immediate steps to enhance the protections that were already in place before this incident. in addition to the investigation, eyemed made changes to how authorized individuals access the eyemed network and required immediate complex password changes to all our employee accounts. eyemed is also reinforcing and providing additional mandatory security awareness training.

based on 1shoppingcart's forensic investigation, the person who gained access to its systems could have accessed your name, address, phone number, email address, and payment card information, such as credit/debit card number, cvv code, and expiration date. the incident did not involve your social security number.

upon learning of the incident, gundry md promptly requested that 1shoppingcart provide us with additional information about the incident, as well as a list of individuals who may have been impacted. we have been working with 1shoppingcart to obtain additional information about the nature of the event to determine the impact on your personal information. on october 30, 2020, we confirmed that some of your personal information may have been affected by the incident. we are not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft arising out of the incident. nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to provide you with notice about the incident.

fraud alerts: you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. a fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit report for one (1) year. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you before establishing any new accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. additional information is available at www.annualcreditreport.com.

credit and security freezes: you may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting agencies as specified above to find out more information.

we are writing to inform you of a cybersecurity incident that may have affected personal information related to you. you provided the information to merchant services* in the course of enrolling for a merchant account.

on november 6, 2020, through merchant services* internal cybersecurity program, we discovered a potential compromise of a website used by part of our u.s. business. we promptly initiated an investigation to determine the nature and potential impact of the vulnerability. in the course of doing so, we identified suspicious activity indicating that an unauthorized actor submitted automated queries to the website. we created a secure environment to test the queries, using available logs and other information to assess potential impact.

by november 19, 2020, we determined that a subset of the queries identified might have involved data held on the website. we analyzed logs and other information available to assess whether those queries could have returned information to unauthorized actors, and we engaged external forensics experts to assist. by december 3, 2020, we determined that some queries may have compromised certain information held on the website, although the evidence is not conclusive. at this time, we have identified evidence of suspicious activity on the website between may 13, 2018, and november 24, 2020. we have notified law enforcement.

although we are not aware of any evidence confirming that the activity resulted in unauthorized actors acquiring or misusing your personal information, we are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution so that you can take steps to protect yourself.

contents of data breach notification letter: notice of data security event

to <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>>:

we are writing to inform you of a data security event that occurred at mednax services, inc. (mednax) and may have impacted your personal information. mednax provides revenue cycle management and other administrative services to its affiliated physician practice groups, including <<b2b_text_1 (covered entity name,/one)>> from which you may have received services.

what happened?

on june 19, 2020, mednax discovered that an unauthorized third party gained access to certain microsoft office 365-hosted mednax business email accounts through phishing. phishing occurs when an email is sent that looks like it is from a trustworthy source, but it is not. the phishing email prompts the recipient to share or give access to certain information. upon discovery of this event, mednax immediately took action to prevent any further unauthorized activity, began an investigation, and engaged a national forensic firm.

based on the investigation, the unauthorized party was able to access certain business email accounts between june 17, 2020 and june 22, 2020. the event was limited to a small number of business email accounts. those email accounts are separate from mednax's internal network and systems, which were not involved in the event. even though a thorough investigation was conducted, it was not possible to conclusively determine whether personal information was actually accessed by the unauthorized party. based on the data analysis that was performed and ultimately completed in late november 2020, we were able to determine which individuals may have had personal information in the impacted business email accounts. <<b2b_text_2 (the data of forty-five (45) rhode island residents may have been impacted.)>> based upon our thorough review of this matter, we are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this event. however, we are notifying you because your personal information may have been in one or more of the impacted business email accounts.

what information may have been involved?

the patient information may have included: (1) patient contact information (such as patient name, guarantor name, address, email address, and date of birth); (2) social security number, driver's license number, state identification number, and/or financial account information; (3) health insurance information (payor name, payor contract dates, policy information including type and deductible amount and subscriber/medicare/medicaid number); (4) medical and/or treatment information (dates of service, location, services requested or procedures performed, diagnosis, prescription information, physician names, and medical record numbers); and (5) billing and claims information (invoices, submitted claims and appeals, and patient account identifiers used by your provider). please note that not all data fields may have been involved for all individuals.

what we are doing.

mednax takes the security of personal information seriously. as soon as we discovered the phishing event, we immediately took action to prevent any further unauthorized activity, including resetting user passwords for business <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>> <<address_1>> <<address_2>> <<city>>, <<state_province>> <<postal_code>> <<country>> email accounts where unauthorized activity was detected. we have and continue to enhance our security controls as appropriate to minimize the risk of any similar event in the future. in addition, we have arranged to offer you identity monitoring services for a period of one year, at no cost to you. you have until march 16, 2021, to activate these services, and instructions on how to activate these services are included in the enclosed reference guide.

what you can do.

in addition to enrolling in complimentary identity monitoring, the enclosed reference guide includes additional information on general steps you can take to monitor and safeguard your personal information. we encourage you to carefully review credit reports and statements sent from providers as well as your insurance company to ensure that all account activity is valid; any questionable charges should be promptly reported to the provider's billing office, or for insurance statements, to your insurance company.

for more information

if you have any questions about this matter or would like additional information, please refer to the enclosed reference guide, visit www.emailevent.kroll.com, or call toll-free 1-833-971-3267. this call center is open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. central time, monday through friday, excluding major u.s. holidays.

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam:

we represent aftra retirement fund (aftra) located at 261 madison avenue, 7th floor, new york, ny 10016-2309. we are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to five hundred thirty-four (534) iowa residents. this notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. by providing this notice, aftra does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of iowa law, the applicability of the iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

aftra originally notified the media nationwide and placed notice of the incident on its website on february 25, 2020.

nature of the data event

on october 28, 2019, aftra received an alert of suspicious activity in its environment. aftra immediately launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the incident. as part of the investigation, which was conducted with the assistance of a third-party forensic expert, it was determined that certain files and folders on aftras network may have been subject to unauthorized access for periods of time between october 24, 2019 and october 28, 2019. aftra does not have evidence that files containing sensitive information were accessed; however, access to these files could not be ruled out. since providing the initial notice via press release and web posting, aftra continued its extensive internal review of the files and folders that may have been subject to unauthorized access.

on september 25, 2020, aftra completed its review and produced a list of individuals that may have been impacted. the information that was potentially subject to unauthorized access includes: name, address, date of birth and social security number.

notice to iowa residents

aftra originally began mailing notice to impacted individuals on february 25, 2020. on that same date, aftra provided notification of this event via a press release to major media outlets in iowa and through a posting on the homepage of its website.	the notification letter suggests that there was an unauthorized access to certain files and folders on aftra's network. although aftra does not have evidence that files containing sensitive information were accessed, access to these files could not be completely ruled out. the incident appears to be an unintended disclosure not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss.

you can take additional steps to help protect yourself

place a one-year fraud alert on your credit file:
an initial one-year fraud alert tells anyone requesting your credit file that you might be at risk for fraud. a lender should verify that you have authorized any request to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit, and/or get a new card on an existing account. if the lender can't verify this, they shouldn't process the request.

contact any one of the credit reporting agencies to set up an initial one-year fraud alert:
- equifax
- experian
- transunion

place a security freeze on your credit file:
a security freeze on your credit file prevents anyone from accessing your credit report and therefore from issuing credit in your name. however, placing a security freeze also may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

contact all three of the credit reporting agencies above to set up a security freeze with each of them.

order your free annual credit reports:
visit annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228 to get a free copy of your credit reports. once you receive them:
- verify that all information is correct.
- look for discrepancies such as accounts you didn't open or creditor inquiries you didn't authorize.
- contact the credit reporting agency if you notice incorrect information or have questions.

manage your personal information:
- carry only essential documents with you.
- be cautious about sharing your personal information with anyone else.
- shred receipts, statements, and other documents containing sensitive information.
- use anti-virus software on your computer and keep it updated.

use tools to monitor your credit and financial accounts:
we suggest that you carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card, and other account information on chase.com and in statements for any transaction you don't recognize. we can provide copies of past statements at no cost to you. call us at 1-888-868-8618 to report unauthorized transactions. work with us to close your account(s) and open new ones with new account numbers. create alerts with your credit card company and bank to notify you of activity.

contents of data breach notification letter: notice of data security event

to <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>>:

we are writing to inform you of a data security event that occurred at mednax services, inc. (mednax) and may have impacted your personal information. mednax provides revenue cycle management and other administrative services to its affiliated physician practice groups, including <<b2b_text_1 (covered entity name,/one)>> from which you may have received services.

what happened?

on <<b2b_text_2 (date of discovery)>>, 2020, mednax discovered that an unauthorized third party gained access to a microsoft office 365-hosted mednax business email account through phishing. phishing occurs when an email is sent that looks like it is from a trustworthy source, but it is not. the phishing email prompts the recipient to share or give access to certain information. upon discovery of this event, mednax immediately took action to prevent any further unauthorized activity, began an investigation, and engaged a national forensic firm.

based on the investigation, the unauthorized party was able to access a business email account <<b2b_text_5 (incident timeline)>><<b2b_text_6 (incident timeline continued)>>. the email account is separate from internal network and systems, which were not involved in the event. even though a thorough investigation was conducted, it was not possible to conclusively determine whether personal information was actually accessed by the unauthorized party. based on the data analysis that was performed and ultimately completed in december 2020, we were able to determine which individuals may have had personal information in the impacted business email account. based upon our thorough review of this matter, we are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this event. however, we are notifying you because your personal information may have been in the impacted business email account.

what information may have been involved?

the patient information may have included: (1) patient contact information (such as patient name, guarantor name, address, email address, date of birth, and/or electronic signature); (2) social security number, drivers license number, non-resident and alien registration number, and/or financial account information; (3) health insurance information (payor name, payor contract dates, policy information including type and deductible amount and subscriber or medicare number); (4) medical and/or treatment information (dates of service, location, services requested or procedures performed, diagnosis, physician names, and medical record numbers); and (5) billing and claims information (invoices, submitted claims and appeals, and patient account identifiers used by your provider). please note that not all data fields may have been involved for all individuals.

you may wish to review the tips provided by the ftc on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft. you may also contact the ftc at federal trade commission, 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20580.

credit reports: you may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an annual credit report request form and mailing it to annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga 30348. you can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/manualrequestform.action.

alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies. contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries is as follows:

equifax 1-866-349-5191 www.equifax.com p.o. box 740241 atlanta, ga 30374

transunion 1-800-888-4213 www.transunion.com p.o. box 2000 chester, pa 19016

fraud alerts: you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. a fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit report for one (1) year. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. additional information is available at www.annualcreditreport.com.

credit and security freezes: you may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information:

re: incident notification

dear sir or madam,

we are writing on behalf of certain dickey's barbecue pit franchisee entities (collectively, "dickey's"), to notify you of a security incident potentially involving iowa residents. dickey's corporate headquarters is located at 4514 cole avenue, suite 1015, dallas, tx 75205.

after receiving reports on october 13, 2020, that a payment card security incident may have occurred at certain dickey's franchise restaurants, dickey's immediately took action to identify and stop the unauthorized activity and began working with its franchisees to conduct a coordinated and thorough investigation. forensic investigation firms were engaged. dickey's also notified law enforcement and worked with the payment card networks to coordinate the investigation. additionally, dickey's provided a preliminary notice of the incident by posting a statement on the dickey's corporate website on november 20, 2020, while the investigation was ongoing.

the investigation is nearly complete. the investigation found the installation of unauthorized code designed to find payment card data at certain franchise restaurant locations at different times over the general period of june 9, 2019, to november 24, 2020, for most locations and a few weeks later for a few locations. the unauthorized code was removed during the investigation. the unauthorized code was only found at approximately fifty-five franchise locations. there are other franchise locations that were investigated, and the unauthorized code was not found. in iowa, the investigation did not identify unauthorized code at any franchise locations.

in addition to these locations, there are other locations that updated their payment application server or system before the investigation began or that otherwise had a server or system that was no longer available for analysis, including one franchise location in iowa. if the unauthorized code had been installed at those locations, the change or update ended the operation of the unauthorized code. because the investigation identified some locations that still had their original payment application server or system and that had no evidence of the installation of unauthorized code, dickey's does not believe that every location that changed or updated its payment application server or system would have had unauthorized code installed.

the code searched for data in the format of track data read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through a restaurant's server. that data may have included the cardholder's name, primary account number, expiration date, and internal verification value.

although the investigation was largely able to identify the locations and time frames involved or potentially involved, it was not able to identify the specific individuals potentially involved. consequently, dickey's is providing substitute notice today by issuing a press release, posting a statement on the dickey's corporate website, and emailing its big yellow cup rewards members who used a payment card at an involved or potentially involved franchise location during the time frame for that location. copies of the press release, website statement, and email are attached. the website will contain a tool that customers can use to look up the franchise locations and time frames involved. in addition, dickey's has established a dedicated, toll-free call center that customers can call to obtain more information regarding the incident.

before this incident occurred, many dickey's franchise restaurants had already implemented a new payment system that uses emv payment technology. dickey's has requested that any franchisee who has not yet done so complete that implementation. dickey's also deployed an endpoint detection and response tool to devices in its corporate environment during the investigation and is developing plans to keep an edr tool in place moving forward. dickey's is exploring additional measures to further enhance payment card security and to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

sincerely,

craig a. hoffman

for immediate release

dickey's provides update about payment card incident

dallas, tx december 29, 2020 - dickey's provided additional information today regarding the payment card security incident reported on november 20, 2020.

after receiving reports that a payment card security incident may have occurred at certain dickey's franchises or locations, dickey's immediately began working with our franchisees to conduct an investigation and forensic investigation firms were engaged. dickey's also notified law enforcement and the payment card networks.

a thorough investigation is being conducted and is nearly complete. the investigation identified the installation of unauthorized code designed to find payment card data operated at certain franchised restaurant locations at different times over the general period of june 9, 2019, to november 24, 2020, for most locations and a few weeks later for a few locations. the unauthorized code was only found at approximately 55 locations. in addition to these locations, there are other locations that updated their payment application server or system before the investigation began or that otherwise had a server or system that was no longer available for analysis. if the unauthorized code had been installed at those locations, the change or update ended the operation of the unauthorized code. there are other locations that were investigated, and the unauthorized code was not found.

the code searched for data in the format of track data read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through a restaurant's server. that data may have included the cardholder's name, primary account number, expiration date, and internal verification value.

a list of the dickey's restaurants and corresponding time frames involved, which vary by location, and a list of the locations that had changes before the investigation started, is available at https://www.dickeys.com/payment-card-notification. this site also provides information about the incident and additional steps customers may take.

dickey's quickly took measures to contain the incident, remove the unauthorized code, and is working to implement measures to further enhance payment card security. nonetheless, it is always advisable	the data breach involves fraud involving debit and credit cards that were skimmed at various dickey's bbq pit locations between june 9, 2019 and november 24, 2020, affecting approximately 55 locations. data collected may have included names, primary account numbers, expiration dates, and internal verification values.
insufficient information	there is no information about the type of breach, so it's impossible to determine the type of breach with certainty.
insufficient information	there is insufficient information to make a determination about the type of breach.
insufficient information	not enough information is available to determine the type of breach.
insufficient information	there is not enough information available to make a determination on the type of breach.

the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers (bac) is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may impact the privacy of some of your personal information. we wanted to provide you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect against the possibility of identity theft and fraud, should you feel it necessary.

what happened?

on june 29, 2020, bac discovered suspicious activity relating to certain bac employee email accounts. bac immediately changed the passwords for the email accounts and began an investigation with assistance from outside computer forensics specialists to determine the nature and scope of the incident. the investigation determined that the employees' email accounts were subject to unauthorized access between june 4, 2020, and july 10, 2020. while our investigation was able to confirm access to the accounts, the investigation was unable to rule out access to any emails or attachments within the accounts. as a result, and with the assistance of third-party forensics, we began an extensive review of the email accounts to determine whether they contained any sensitive information and to whom the information relates. the forensic investigator completed its careful, time-consuming analysis of the contents of the email accounts on september 21, 2020, and prepared a list of potentially impacted individuals whose information was determined to be present in the emails or attachments possibly viewed by the unauthorized person(s). bac is still searching its internal records to locate the addresses for certain potentially affected individuals. bac also notified state regulators, as required.

what information was involved?

the following types of personal information were found within the impacted email accounts: your name, <<data elements>>. to date, we have no indication that any personal information has been subject to actual or attempted misuse in relation to this incident.

what we are doing.

we take this incident and the security of personal information within our care very seriously. upon discovery of this incident, we immediately took steps to secure the email accounts and launched an in-depth investigation with the assistance of outside computer forensics specialists to determine the full nature and scope of this incident. as part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy of personal information in our care, we reviewed our existing policies and procedures and implemented additional safeguards to further secure the information in our systems. we also notified regulatory authorities, as required by law. as an added precaution, bac is also offering twelve (12) months of complimentary access to credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration services through transunion. individuals who wish to receive these services must enroll by following the attached enrollment instructions.

what you can do.

you can find out more about how to protect against potential identity theft and fraud in the enclosed steps you can take to help protect your personal information. there you will also find more information on the credit monitoring services we are offering and how to enroll.

for more information.

we understand that you may have questions about this incident that are not addressed in this letter. if you have additional questions, please call the dedicated assistance line that we have helped set-up at 800-369-1370, monday through friday from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. eastern time, excluding u.s. holidays.

contents of data breach notification letter: notice of data breach

dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

we regret to inform you that one of our third-party vendors, blackbaud, experienced a cyber incident that may have allowed access to some of your personal information. as a result, you are entitled to free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services.

what happened?

blackbaud is an engagement and fundraising software service provider that offers multiple solutions to non-profit companies, schools, and institutions across the united states. blackbaud was the target of a ransomware attack, and the cyber-criminal may have had access to specific personal information identified below between february and may 20, 2020.

once blackbaud detected the intrusion, it was able to halt further system access. the cyber-criminal only gained access to certain back-up files in specific blackbaud solutions. blackbaud, in conjunction with the fbi, investigated the incident and ultimately paid a ransom to the cyber-criminal under the assurance that any exfiltrated files would be destroyed. their system was fully restored after ransom payment. through vigilant monitoring post-incident, blackbaud reports that there has been no evidence of improper use of any of the data files that may have been exposed. blackbaud has already implemented changes to their data security protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.

as part of their continuing investigation, blackbaud discovered when it merged data from previous versions of some of their solutions into current versions, there were hidden tables containing the older data (which included unencrypted personal information) merged into the new program which were not visible. we were notified of this new exposure on september 29, 2020, and took action to verify and determine scope. we are notifying you now of the breach, as it took time to coordinate with blackbaud and their cooperation in producing the hidden data files. according to blackbaud, the information was exposed because the company failed to destroy or encrypt certain legacy files after a migration of our files to a new platform.

what pi was exposed?

at this time, we are informed that sensitive personal information, including your name, phone number, address, and social security or tax identification number, may have been exposed. this is older data from the prior legacy versions of the programs that were used before migration.

what you can do:

to help you guard against identity theft or other potential fraud as a result of this incident, blackbaud is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services for 24 months. information about how to access these services accompanies this letter. although services are available to you, it is important to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspected fraud to law enforcement. for information on avoiding identity theft, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

in addition, security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file.

contents of data breach notification letter: re: notice of data breach

please read this entire letter. we are contacting you regarding a data security incident at matson navigation company that matson learned of on october 14, 2020. this incident may have involved your personal information, including personal information that may have included your name, birth date, social security number, and other identifying information. as a result, your personal information may have been exposed to others. please be assured that we are taking all appropriate steps necessary to address the incident.

what happened?

on wednesday, october 14, 2020, matson learned that its network had experienced a cyber-attack in which the attacker accessed parts of our network. our it team worked quickly to cut off the attacker's access. we do not know with certainty whether any internal information was exposed or stolen in the course of the breach of our network, but we are proceeding as if it was. we have no indication at this time that any of our information has been used or sold.

what information was involved?

among the information on the servers that were likely accessed is personal information, which would likely include your name, birth date, contact information, and social security number. the information maintained in the accessed servers was collected in the normal course of business by matson's human resources department and benefits groups, because you have worked with or for matson.

what are we doing?

as soon as matson learned that its network experienced a cyber-attack, it hired leading forensics, cyber-recovery first responder, credit reporting, and legal teams to assist in our incident response. we believe we cut off the attacker's access quickly, have been successful in safely restoring our systems, and are ensuring that those systems are clean. we are still working hard at our recovery of some systems and files, and in the meantime, operations have continued normally. we continue to book freight, and our vessels continue to sail as scheduled. we have also reported the incident to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.

security freeze:

under federal law, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file for up to one year at no cost. this will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. in order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement. you cannot be charged to place, lift or remove a security freeze.

contents of data breach notification letter: notice of data breach

we are writing to inform you that your personal information may have been compromised due to a possible data breach within our system. we regret to inform you of this incident and want to assure you that we are taking steps to address the issue.

what happened?

between october 8th to 15th, our office received several irs e-file rejections due to tax returns already being on file with the irs for 2019 for clients we were then processing.

what information was involved?

the type of information that we believe may have been compromised includes:

- names
- addresses
- social security numbers
- bank account information, if in our system for refunds or electronic funds withdrawal for tax filings
- dates of birth
- drivers license number, if you have provided this to us for e-filing in the past
- dependent(s) name, social security number(s) and date(s) of birth

what are we doing?

after receiving several irs e-file rejections, we spent the next several weeks working with multiple it forensic services to determine if our office was the source of the issue. during the course of these investigations, a malware file was detected and immediately deleted. we have not been informed that the malware specifically operated in any particular manner; however, based on the investigations conducted, it was determined that it is more likely than not that the malware file was the source of the compromise that led to the fraudulent tax returns. we have reason to believe that on september 10, 2020, a malware file gained access to one of our servers and allowed a perpetrator to access 2018 and 2019 income tax data.

as part of our ongoing commitment to the security of your information, we implemented increased security measures, including a top-tier anti-virus software (eset) on all of our workstations. please know that since this determination, our office has been in contact with the internal revenue service, where an independent review is being performed to determine whether your tax account has been compromised and to attempt to identify the perpetrator.

steps to take to protect your identity

we encourage you to maintain vigilance against other incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity for the next twelve (12) to twenty-four (24) months.

you may also choose to voluntarily enroll in the irs identity protection pin program, where the irs will mail you a six-digit number each january that prevents someone else from filing a tax return using your social security number. please bear in mind that if you choose to enroll and misplace your ip pin, your tax return would be required to be filed via the traditional paper process. beginning in mid-january 2021, you can enroll using an online service via https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin.

veritex holdings, inc. (veritex) is writing to inform you of an incident that could affect the security of some of your information. while we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we take this incident very seriously and we are providing you with information about the incident, our response to it, and resources available to you to help protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

what happened?

earlier this year, veritex became aware of unusual activity involving certain employee email accounts and immediately began an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic investigators. on may 8, 2020, the investigation determined that certain employee email accounts were accessed without authorization at varying times between april 2, 2020 and april 27, 2020. unfortunately, the available evidence did not allow us to determine what, if any, emails and attachments were viewed while the accounts were subject to unauthorized access.

therefore, the forensic investigator reviewed the email accounts to identify any personal information that was located in the email accounts at the time of the unauthorized access and could have been accessible. on september 25, 2020, we determined that some personal information was present in one or more of the email accounts at the time of the incident. we reviewed this information and our internal records to identify the individuals associated with this information and their address for purposes of providing notice. through this process we determined that some of your personal information was contained in one or more of the impacted email accounts.

what information was involved?

our investigation determined that at the time of the incident the email accounts contained information including your name, <<data elements>>. to date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

what we are doing.

we take this incident and the security of personal information in our care very seriously. upon learning of this incident, we promptly began an investigation using external digital forensic specialists, changed email account credentials, and investigated to confirm the security of our email network. we are also working to enhance our existing security processes and protocols.

as an added precaution, we are also offering you access to 12 months of identity monitoring services through transunion interactive, a subsidiary of transunion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies at no cost to you. these services include credit monitoring and identity theft restoration. if you wish to activate these identity monitoring services, you may follow the instructions included in the steps you can take to protect your information.

what you can do.

we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. please review the enclosed steps you can take to protect your information. you can also enroll to receive the free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services we are offering.

on july 16, 2020, we were notified that an unauthorized party had gained access to several email accounts on our business associate's microsoft office 365 hosted email system (o365 system) between june 17, 2020, and june 22, 2020, through phishing. based on the investigation that our business associate performed, and ultimately completed in november 2020, your personal information was stored within one or more of these email accounts. we cannot tell from available forensic evidence if these files were actually viewed by the unauthorized party. the unauthorized actions we are able to see in these email accounts all appear to be in furtherance of unsuccessful payroll fraud attempts. efforts to change the bank details for employee pay were not successful.

what information was available?

our business associate has reported that personal information may have included:

1. patient contact information (such as patient name, guarantor name, address, email address, and date of birth)
2. state identification number and/or social security number
3. health insurance information (payor name, payor contract dates, policy information including type and deductible amount and subscriber/medicare/medicaid number)
4. medical and/or treatment information (dates of service, location, services requested or procedures performed, diagnosis, prescription information, physician names, and medical record numbers)
5. billing, payment, and claims information (invoices, payment details, submitted claims and appeals, and patient account identifiers used by your provider)

please note that not all of these data fields may have been involved for all individuals.

what we are doing

after discovering the phishing event, our business associate took steps to terminate the unauthorized party's access to the o365 system. this included, for example, resetting each user's password for the email accounts where unauthorized activity was detected. the email accounts on the o365 system that were used by american anesthesiology employees have now been moved over to our email system. we have added authentication requirements to restrict access to the email accounts of these american anesthesiology employees. we also will be introducing additional authentication and security training requirements for all of our employees in 2021 to counteract phishing and other social engineering techniques.

what you can do

in addition to enrolling in complimentary credit monitoring, we encourage you to carefully review credit reports, patient billing statements, and statements sent from your insurance company to ensure that all account activity is valid; any questionable charges should be promptly reported.

what happened?

on september 14, 2020, usf experienced an it security event (the incident) that involved the inaccessibility of certain computer systems on our network as a result of a malware infection. we responded to the incident immediately and retained third-party computer forensic specialists to assist in our investigation. through our immediate investigation and response, we determined that data on a number of servers and workstations connected to our domain had been encrypted by ransomware. we proactively removed a number of systems from our network upon discovering the incident. with the assistance of our third-party computer forensic specialists, we remediated the malware identified, ensured the security of our environment, and reconnected systems on september 20, 2020. we also notified federal law enforcement authorities of the incident and continue to cooperate with their investigation. the forensic investigation is now concluded and confirmed that the unauthorized actor acquired a limited number of files during the period of unauthorized access, which occurred between august 12, 2020 and september 14, 2020, when the ransomware was executed.

what information was involved?

we have been working diligently with a specialized team of third-party data auditors to perform a comprehensive review of all information contained in the files accessed without authorization as a result of the incident. the purpose of this review was to accurately identify any individuals whose personal information may have been present within the impacted files and therefore accessible to the unauthorized actor. we recently received the results of this review and determined on december 4, 2020, that the following information relating to you was included in the impacted files when they were accessed without authorization: name and <<breached elements>>. the impacted files may have also contained your date of birth. please note, however, that we have no evidence of actual misuse of your information as a result of the incident.

what we are doing.

in response to the incident, usf has taken the following actions to mitigate any risk of compromise to your information and to better prevent a similar event from recurring: (1) fortified the security of our firewall; (2) utilized the forensic specialists engaged to monitor network activity and remediate any suspicious activity; (3) provided notification to potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible. we are also adapting our existing employee training protocols relating to data protection and security, including training targeted at recognizing phishing emails. we believe these steps will be effective in mitigating any potential harm to you. as always, we encourage you to review your account statements, explanations of benefits, and credit reports carefully for unexpected activity and to report any questionable activity to the associated institutions immediately.

re: security incident notification

to whom it may concern:

i serve as counsel for the wayne state foundation (hereinafter "wsf"), and provide this notification to you of a recent data security incident suffered by blackbaud. blackbaud is one of the world's largest providers of customer relationship management systems, serving more than 35,000 clients around the world in the nonprofit and education sectors, including wsf.

on july 16, 2020, wsf was notified by blackbaud that it had discovered and stopped a ransomware attack that occurred in may 2020. according to the notification received by wsf, blackbaud's systems that were affected by the attack included a database containing certain information about wsf's community. according to the notification provided by blackbaud, the attacker(s) may have acquired an unknown amount of data maintained within blackbaud's database. blackbaud informed us that it paid a ransom to the attacker and obtained confirmation that the compromised information had been destroyed and is no longer in the possession of the attacker(s).

according to blackbaud, and as far as we know, there is no indication that any of the compromised information has been subject to misuse or to further disclosure. blackbaud has made numerous assurances that bank account information, usernames, passwords, and social security numbers that may have been contained in the affected systems were encrypted and the decryption keys were not compromised.

on september 23, 2020, wsf received a backup of their blackbaud database impacted by the incident suffered by blackbaud. wsf immediately began working to review the data to determine whether sensitive information was contained within the database. however, due to the complexity of the database file provided by blackbaud, this took significant time and effort with the assistance of third-party forensic experts. at this time, wsf had no reason to believe that any resident of iowa was impacted.

on november 17, 2020, wsf's experts provided a list of all individuals contained within the blackbaud database, as well as the potentially impacted information. at this time, no personal information was identified. however, after further review, wsf discovered that the blackbaud database's import id field may have contained individuals' social security number despite blackbaud's continued assurances that such information was not impacted in this incident.

on december 29, 2020, after a thorough review process, wsf confirmed that two thousand, eight hundred and ninety-two (2,892) residents of iowa were potentially impacted as a result of this incident, as their import id is the same as the individual's social security number. wsf is working to provide notification, including complimentary credit monitoring services for one (1) year, to affected individuals on january 13, 2021. a copy of the drafted letter is attached. wsf is taking steps to comply with all applicable notification obligations.

please contact me should you have any questions.

very truly yours,

dear <<first_name>>:

the archer school for girls (archer) is writing to notify you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our vendors, blackbaud, inc. (blackbaud). this notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

what happened?

blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits, including archer. on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified us and many other institutions that it had discovered an attempted encryption attack on blackbaud's network in may 2020. blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince blackbaud to pay a ransom. blackbaud paid the ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed by the unauthorized individual had been destroyed. the time period of unauthorized access was between february 7, 2020, and may 20, 2020. blackbaud also reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

upon learning of the incident from blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation to determine what information was involved in the blackbaud incident. initially, blackbaud informed us that the fields in the database backups containing personal information were encrypted and therefore not accessible by the unauthorized individual. however, blackbaud's further investigation determined that was not the case, and informed us of its updated findings on september 29, 2020. we worked with blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved and determined on november 10, 2020, that the backup files contained certain unencrypted information pertaining to you.

what information was involved?

the backup file involved contained your <<b2b_text_1(impacted data)>>. blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused, disseminated, or otherwise be made available publicly.

what you can do.

while we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. if your health insurance or medical information was involved, it is also advisable to review the billing statements you receive from your health insurer or healthcare provider. if you see charges for services you did not receive, please contact the insurer or provider immediately.

if you file a theft report with experian, you will be contacted by a member of the recovery department who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. in the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned a recovery advocate who will work on your behalf to identify, stop, and reverse the damage quickly.

notify law enforcement of suspicious activity: you should know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement.

fraud alerts: you may want to consider placing a fraud alert with the three credit bureaus. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing page 3 a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information to place fraud alerts at all three bureaus is as follows:

security freeze: by placing a freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. there is no cost for this service. simply contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above in writing to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. in order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement.

we are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information. waters & kraus, llp takes the protection of personal information very seriously and we want to explain the incident, the measures we have taken in response, and some additional steps you may consider taking.

what happened?

we recently discovered unauthorized access to certain employee email accounts. as soon as we discovered the incident, we took immediate steps to secure the email environment. a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with the investigation and determined that an unauthorized party was able to access certain accounts between december 5, 2019, and may 15, 2020. unfortunately, the investigation was not able to determine which emails and attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized party. therefore, we conducted a thorough review of the contents of the email accounts involved to determine the specific individuals whose information was contained within the emails and attachments. we completed the review process on december 10, 2020, and then we analyzed the results and determined that an email or attachment in the account included some of your information.

although we believe the unauthorized actor accessed the account to obtain information on the companies with which we do business, and not to obtain personal information on individuals, we are notifying you of this incident and steps you can take to protect your information out of an abundance of caution.

what information was involved?

contents of data breach notification letter: notice of data breach

dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

we regret to inform you that our third-party fundraising software provider, blackbaud, experienced a global data security breach earlier this year, which has impacted many of its clients around the world, including wildwood school. unfortunately, this incident involves the potential exposure of personal information of some of our community members.

the compromised data did not contain any credit card information or other personally identifiable information such as bank account information, usernames, passwords, or social security numbers.

while the cyber-attack did not occur at wildwood school or as a result of any action on our part, we take the protection of our community's information very seriously and wanted to make you aware of the incident, what it may mean to you, and steps you can take to secure your information.

what happened?

blackbaud is a software service provider used by non-profit companies, schools, and institutions. earlier this year, blackbaud was the subject of a ransomware attack, and the cyber-criminal may have had access to specific personal information identified below between february and may 20, 2020. once blackbaud detected the intrusion, it was able to halt further system access. as a result, the cyber-criminal only gained access to certain back-up files in specific blackbaud solutions. blackbaud, in conjunction with the fbi, investigated the incident and ultimately paid a ransom to the cyber-criminal under the assurance that any exfiltrated files would be destroyed, and their system was fully restored after ransom payment. through vigilant monitoring post-incident, blackbaud reports that there has been no evidence of improper use of any of the data files that may have been exposed. blackbaud has already implemented changes to their data security protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.

what was exposed?

wildwood received notice of this incident in july 2020, including information on the specific blackbaud solution back-ups exposed. we immediately took action to understand the potential exposure and scope of personal data and retained counsel to assist and advise. as a result of the ransomware attack, there was exposure of your first/last name, phone number, address, date of birth, and medical vaccination record. no other sensitive personal information or financial information was exposed, as all such information is encrypted.

what you can do:

we advise you to remain vigilant in reviewing your account statements, monitoring and placing a fraud alert on your free credit reports. please refer to the enclosed information for the resources available to you, and the steps that you can take to further protect your personal information.

security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file.

for more information:

we recognize that you may have questions not addressed in this letter. if you have additional questions, please call kroll at 1-xxx-xxx-xxxx, monday through friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. central time. kroll representatives have been fully versed on the incident and can answer questions or concerns you may have regarding protection of your personal information.

fraud alerts: you can place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus by phone and online with equifax, transunion, or experian. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. as of september 21, 2018, initial fraud alerts last for one year. victims of identity theft can also get an extended fraud alert for seven years. the phone numbers for all three credit bureaus are at the bottom of this page.

monitoring: you should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.

security freeze: you also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. a security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. to place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency. you may make that request by certified mail, overnight mail, regular stamped mail, or by following the instructions found at the websites listed below. the following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse or a minor under the age of 16, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) social security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the registry of motor vehicles. the request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. it is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. as of september 21, 2018, it is free to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. you may also place a security freeze for children under the age of 16. you may obtain a free security freeze by contacting any one or more of the following national consumer reporting agencies:

dear friend of fairmont private schools,

we regret to inform you that one of our third-party vendors, blackbaud, experienced a cyber incident that may have allowed access to some of your personal information. as a result, you are entitled to free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services.

what happened?

blackbaud is a software service provider that offers engagement and fundraising solutions to non-profit companies, schools, and institutions across the united states. between february and may 20, 2020, blackbaud was the victim of a ransomware attack, and the cyber-criminal may have had access to specific personal information, including your name, phone number, address, and social security or tax identification number. blackbaud detected the intrusion and was able to halt further system access. the cyber-criminal only gained access to certain back-up files in specific blackbaud solutions. blackbaud, in conjunction with the fbi, investigated the incident and ultimately paid a ransom to the cyber-criminal under the assurance that any exfiltrated files would be destroyed. after the ransom payment, their system was fully restored. through vigilant monitoring post-incident, blackbaud reports that there has been no evidence of improper use of any of the data files that may have been exposed. blackbaud has already implemented changes to their data security protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.

as part of their continuing investigation, blackbaud discovered that when it merged data from previous versions of some of their solutions into current versions, there were hidden tables containing the older data (which included unencrypted personal information) merged into the new program which were not visible. we were notified of this new exposure on september 29, 2020, and took action to verify and determine scope, which required the cooperation of blackbaud in producing the hidden data files. according to blackbaud, the information was exposed because the company failed to destroy or encrypt certain legacy files after a migration of our files to a new platform.

what pi was exposed?

at this time, we are informed that sensitive personal information, including your name, phone number, address, and social security or tax identification number, was exposed. this is older data from the prior legacy versions of the programs that were used prior to migration.

what you can do:

to help you guard against identity theft or other potential fraud as a result of this incident, blackbaud is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services for 24 months. information about how to access these services accompanies this letter. although services are available to you, it is important to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspected fraud to law enforcement. for information on avoiding identity theft, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

in addition, security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file.

we encourage you to contact cyberscout to enroll in free cyberscout services by going to https://www.cyberscouthq.com/epiq263?ac=263hq1329 and using the enrollment code provided above. please note the deadline to enroll is march 1, 2021.

again, at this time, there is no evidence that your information has been misused. however, we encourage you to take full advantage of this service offering. enclosed hereto you will find additional information regarding the resources available to you, and the steps that you can take to further protect your personal information.

for more information:

if you have additional questions, please call kroll at 1-???-???-????, monday through friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. central time. kroll representatives have been fully informed about the incident and can answer questions or concerns you may have regarding protection of your personal information.

contents of data breach notification letter: re: notice of data breach

dear (name),

we are writing to inform you about a data security breach that may have affected your personal information. at st. francis catholic high school, we take the protection and proper use of your personal information very seriously. this letter will explain the incident and provide you with steps you can take to protect yourself.

what happened

blackbaud, one of our third-party vendors and one of the world's largest providers of software for nonprofits, universities, and k12 schools, used by more than 25,000 organizations in more than 60 countries, notified st. francis of a security breach. blackbaud stated that its cybersecurity team, together with forensics experts and law enforcement, successfully prevented the cybercriminals from blocking blackbaud's access. they discovered and stopped the ransomware attack. however, prior to locking the cybercriminal out, it appears a copy of a 2007 backup file containing some of your personal information was removed.

blackbaud paid the cybercriminals' demand with confirmation that the copy removed has been destroyed. based on the nature of this incident, their research and third-party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. initially, blackbaud assured clients that no personal information had been exposed because it was encrypted. after further investigation, blackbaud disclosed that some personal information left behind in legacy files had not been encrypted.

what information was involved

it is important to note that the cybercriminal did not access your credit card information. however, it has been determined that the file removed may have contained your daughter's name, date of birth, and social security number.

what blackbaud is doing

as part of ongoing efforts, blackbaud states that it has already implemented several changes that will protect your data from any subsequent incidents. first, its teams identified the vulnerability associated with this incident, including the tactics used by the cybercriminal, and took action to fix it. blackbaud has tested its fix with multiple third parties, including the appropriate platform vendors, and assured us that it withstands all known attack tactics. they also are accelerating their efforts to further protect data through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, deployment of additional endpoint, and network-based platforms.

what we are doing

we are notifying affected families about this incident. we are continuing to work with blackbaud to make sure that no sensitive data has been removed from the database. we have no reason to believe the information has been misused or made available publicly, but we encourage you to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear <<name 1>>,

we are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information. on august 17, 2020, certain computer systems were infected with malware that encrypted the data on those machines. we quickly identified and contained the malware, restored systems from available backups, and launched an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm which was engaged on our behalf. on september 24, 2020, we learned that an unauthorized party had gained access to some of our systems that contained personal information of our customers.

the investigation was unable to determine what, if any, data was accessed by the unauthorized party. out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying all customers and patients whose personal information was stored in the systems that were accessed by the unauthorized party. the stored information that was potentially accessible includes your name, social security number, driver's license number, and/or financial account information.

as a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership from mytrueidentity through transunion interactive, a subsidiary of transunion. the service is completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity.

you can sign up for the online or offline credit monitoring service anytime between now and <<enrollment deadline>>. due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with transunion or an address in the united states (or its territories) and a valid social security number. enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports?

there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com

transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com

equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze?

a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

please note: no one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. security freeze. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. there is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

the oakwood school is writing to notify you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our vendors, blackbaud, inc. (blackbaud). this notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

what happened?

blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified us and many other institutions that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on blackbaud's network in may 2020. blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince blackbaud to pay a ransom. blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. the time period of unauthorized access was between february 7, 2020, to may 20, 2020. blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

upon learning of the incident from blackbaud, we conducted our investigation of the blackbaud services we use and the information provided by blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. initially, blackbaud informed us that the fields in the database backups containing personal information were encrypted and not accessible by the unauthorized individual. however, blackbaud's further investigation determined that was not the case, and informed us of their updated findings on september 29, 2020. we worked with blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved and determined on november 12, 2020, that the backup files contained certain unencrypted information pertaining to you.

what information was involved?

the backup file involved contained your name and social security number. blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

what you can do:

even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. as a precaution, blackbaud is offering you a complimentary membership to identity monitoring and fraud resolution services for two years. this product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. these services are completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more information on the identity monitoring and fraud resolution services, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary two-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in the following pages.

what we are doing:

we are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that blackbaud is taking in response. blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

what happened?

the university recently concluded its investigation of an incident that involved unauthorized access to one employee's email account. upon first suspecting unauthorized access to the employee's email account, we immediately secured the account and launched an investigation with assistance from a cybersecurity firm. in connection with that investigation, we learned that an unauthorized party gained access to the employee's email account between september 24, 2020, and september 28, 2020. our investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized party actually viewed any emails or attachments in the account.

what information was involved?

in an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments contained in the email account to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized party. on january 4, 2021, we determined that an email and/or attachment contained your <<b2b_text_1(impacteddata)>>.

what we are doing

we regret any concern this incident may cause you. to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we have implemented additional data security measures to enhance the security of our network, including hiring additional resources for cybersecurity training and providing additional training on cybersecurity and phishing for all of our employees with access to personal information.

what you can do

to date, we are unaware of any misuse of the information maintained in the employee's email account, nor do we have any evidence that any emails or attachments containing your information were actually viewed. however, we want to inform you of this event, assure you that we take this very seriously, and provide you with ways to protect your information. as a precaution, we have secured the services of experian to offer you a complimentary one-year membership in experian's identityworkssm. this product helps detect possible misuse of your information and provides you with identity protection support focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. identityworks is completely free, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more information on identityworks, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take to protect your information, please see the pages that follow this letter. also, we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your financial account statements for any unauthorized activity. if you see charges or activity you did not authorize, please contact your financial institution immediately.

we are writing to inform you about a data breach incident involving your personal information maintained by traffic solutions corporation, doing business as statewide safety systems (statewide), with regard to your employment. statewide values and respects the privacy of its workers, which is why we are providing notice to you about the incident and the tools you can use to protect yourself against possible identity theft or fraud.

on january 7, 2021, statewide discovered that a file containing the personal information of some statewide employees was recently found on a thumb drive recovered by law enforcement in the home of a former statewide employee. we have determined that the file containing the personal information was downloaded from statewide's systems onto the thumb drive shortly before the individual's employment was terminated in june of 2018. law enforcement discovered the file on the thumb drive as part of the investigation into crimes unrelated to statewide. the individual has been arrested and charged by law enforcement. the former employee was not authorized to acquire statewide's information during the individual's employment, and we consider the unauthorized acquisition to be a theft. statewide has determined that your personal information was contained in the file located on the thumb drive. law enforcement is currently in possession of the thumb drive, and we are unaware of any copies of the file made by the individual. furthermore, we are not aware of any facts indicating that the personal information stolen by the individual has been shared, sold, or otherwise used by the individual since the unlawful acquisition in 2018. our investigation is ongoing.

upon discovery of this event by law enforcement, statewide promptly engaged legal counsel to assist with the investigation and has worked with law enforcement to investigate the incident. based on our investigation, we believe the unauthorized acquisition occurred in june of 2018. we are continuing to investigate whether the former employee engaged in other unauthorized activities and are continuing to assist law enforcement in its investigation.

if you are receiving this letter, statewide has determined that you are part of the group of individuals whose personal information was contained on the thumb drive recovered by law enforcement. the information impacted includes your first and last name, date of birth, social security number, and other information related to your employment, including your hire date, termination date (if applicable), hours worked, and 401k allocations as of approximately june of 2018.

as a precautionary measure, statewide is providing each potentially impacted employee with free credit monitoring service through experian for 12 months. for more information on identity theft prevention and identityworks credit 3b, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this letter. in the meantime, we encourage you to take the following steps to further protect your information:

3. take advantage of additional free resources on identity theft. we recommend that you review the tips provided by the federal trade commission's consumer information website, a valuable resource with some helpful tips on how to protect your information. additional information is available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/privacy-identity-online-security. for more information, please visit identitytheft.gov or call 1-877-id-theft (877-438-4338). a copy of identity theft a recovery plan, a comprehensive guide from the ftc to help you guard against and deal with identity theft, can be found on the ftc's website at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0009_identitytheft_a_recovery_plan.pdf.

on august 15, 2020, we detected unauthorized third-party access to portions of our information technology systems. we acted quickly to shut down the intrusion, restore operations, and prevent further unauthorized access. we engaged a major cybersecurity firm to investigate the matter, and law enforcement and appropriate regulators were notified about the incident.

what information was involved?

it appears that in early august, the unauthorized third-party gained access to certain personal information relating to some of our guests, employees, and crew. the impacted information includes data routinely collected during the guest travel booking process, during the casino experience, or through the course of employment. that information may include names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and dates of birth, and in some limited instances, additional personal information, such as social security or national identification numbers, health information, or other personal information.

working with our cybersecurity experts, the company took steps to recover its files and has evidence indicating a low likelihood of the data being misused.

what we are doing.

as part of our ongoing security operations, we regularly review our security and privacy policies and procedures and implement changes when needed to enhance our information security and privacy program and controls. for the benefit of those whose personal information may have been impacted, we are also offering individuals free credit monitoring and identity theft detection services for 12 months through cyberscout. details on how to access free credit monitoring and identity theft detection services are in the enclosed appendix a.

we are writing to inform you that there may have been a breach of some of your personal information held by sutter buttes imaging medical group (sbi) for diagnostic imaging services performed at sutter buttes imaging center, 945 shasta street, yuba city, ca.

in december 2020, we discovered that third-party it hardware used by sbi had vulnerabilities that allowed unauthorized access between july 2019 and december 2020. after a thorough investigation, sbi determined that certain patient information may have been accessed by unauthorized parties during that time. the information that may have been accessed includes the study date, patient name, date of birth, type of imaging procedure, and patient and study number (both internal numbers created by sbi).

it is important to note that the information potentially exposed did not include social security numbers, credit card numbers, or any medical diagnoses, medical images, or medical reports or notes.

sbi takes privacy and security matters very seriously. we conducted a thorough investigation and took several critical steps to address the identified it vulnerabilities and to prevent a similar incident from happening again. sbi closed certain firewall ports to prevent future access and also engaged third-party it consultants to perform a thorough analysis and bolster our security controls going forward.

we care deeply about protecting your personal information and understand the concern that this situation may cause. although we have not uncovered evidence to suggest that your information has been inappropriately disclosed or used, we wanted to alert you of the incident and its relevance to you.

we have attached a list of additional resources commonly used to protect against identity theft or fraud.

an initial security alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a victim of fraud. when you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit on an existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the lender should take steps to verify that you have authorized the request. if the creditor cannot verify this, the request should not be satisfied. there is no cost to you to place a fraud alert and it remains on your credit file for at least one year. you may contact one of the credit reporting companies below for assistance.

use tools from credit providers

carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card, and other account statements. be proactive and create alerts on credit cards and bank accounts to notify you of activity. if you discover unauthorized or suspicious activity on your credit report or by any other means, file an identity theft report with your local police and contact a credit reporting company. you may also contact your state attorney general if you believe you have been the victim of identity theft.

review your explanation of benefits statement

regularly review the explanation of benefits statement(s) that you receive from your health care providers or health plan. if you see any service that you believe you did not receive, you should contact your health care provider or health plan at the telephone number listed on the explanation of benefits statements. if you do not receive regular explanation of benefits statements, contact your health care providers or health plan and ask that they send you a copy after each visit you make to your health care providers.

re: scheduling software data incident

dear valued customer,

we have recently been informed by avianis, our third-party scheduling software provider, of a data incident. this incident has regrettably impacted jet aviation and a number of other operators using the system.

our it, security, and operational teams have been working closely with avianis to ascertain the impact and determine next steps. at this stage, we understand certain categories of personally identifying data may have been compromised, notably passport, travel visa, and driver's license information. however, we do not believe that flight plans, passenger manifest details, and payment transactions have been compromised.

avianis has notified local and federal authorities of the incident and has assured us it will provide us with regular updates. importantly, avianis informed us it has identified and addressed the vulnerability that allowed this specific event to occur and has also informed us and other operators it has taken necessary corrective actions to prevent such an incident from occurring again.

we understand the importance of your privacy and deeply regret the inconvenience caused by this issue. should you wish to subscribe to a monitoring service at this time, we will bear that cost.

we take such issues very seriously and will continue to keep you informed as we receive further updates from avianis. in the meantime, please feel free to contact us directly. alternatively, should you wish to reach one of our team, please contact your personal client aviation director or send us an email at data-support@jetaviation.com.

we determined that the following types of information related to you may have been accessed and acquired by the unknown actor during this incident: name, <<data elements>>.

what happened

harvard eye associates contracts with a vendor for online data storage. on january 15, 2021, the vendor notified harvard eye that hackers had accessed the vendor's computer system and taken some of our data.

the vendor informed harvard eye that the hackers had demanded money to return the data they had taken. after consulting with cybersecurity experts and the fbi, the vendor made the payment. the hackers then returned the data and told the vendor that they had not disclosed the data or kept any copies. the vendor determined, through its investigation, that the hackers might have been able to access harvard eye's data as early as october 24, 2020. the vendor's cybersecurity experts have been monitoring the internet and have not found any evidence that the hackers used or disclosed any of the data.

what information was involved

the information taken by the hackers included some of harvard eye's own patient information. it also included information about patients of alicia surgery center, which harvard eye was using in order to perform administrative services for the surgery center.

the hackers did not have access to your social security number, driver's license number, other government id number, or credit or debit card information.

what we are doing

at harvard eye and alicia surgery center, we have taken steps to review and analyze the incident, and we will continue our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the security of our patients' data.

notice of data breach

dear [insert customer name]:

we are contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred on january 31, 2021 at axlehire, inc. as a result, your personal information may have been potentially exposed to others. please be assured that we have taken every step necessary to address the incident.

what happened

when we were preparing the 1099 tax forms for our drivers in january 2021, there was a software glitch that resulted in some drivers receiving the wrong 1099 forms. the error was isolated, and therefore, only caused errors within a small random subset of our driver population. after the incident, we were able to determine which drivers received incorrect 1099 forms and will maintain this record internally in the event any issues arise in the future. in the meantime, we have contacted all drivers who received a 1099 form other than their own and have requested that they discard the information they received about other drivers.

what information was involved

this incident involved your name, address, and social security number.

what we are doing

axlehire has fixed the software issue above and sent out corrected 1099 forms to each driver. furthermore, in order to avoid the opportunity for error in the future, axlehire will instead post a password-protected 1099 for each driver within the driver app link accessible only under a driver's unique login credentials. to help further protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary two-year membership of experian's identityworkssm. this product provides you with superior identity detection and resolution of identity theft. to activate your membership and start monitoring your personal information, please follow the steps below:

what you can do

monitor your accounts

you should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud, identity theft, and errors by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports. if you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions, as major credit card companies have rules that restrict them from requiring you to pay for fraudulent charges that are timely reported. in addition, you are encouraged to contact the federal trade commission (ftc), law enforcement, or your state attorney general to report incidents of suspected identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. you can contact the ftc at:

if you are a resident of maryland or oregon, please review appendix b for additional information that may be applicable to you.

obtain your credit reports

you should also monitor your credit reports. you may periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide consumer reporting agency. if you discover inaccurate information or a fraudulent transaction on your credit report, you have the right to request that the consumer reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file. in addition, under federal law, you are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. you may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling (877) 322-8228. you also may complete the annual credit report request form available from the ftc at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf, and mail it to annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga 30348-5281. you may also contact any of the three major consumer reporting agencies to request a copy of your credit report.

harvard eye associates and alicia surgery center value our patients and their privacy. that is why we are writing you this letter together to let you know about an incident that involved your personal information.

what happened

harvard eye associates contracts with a vendor for online data storage. on january 15, 2021, the vendor notified harvard eye that hackers had accessed the vendor's computer system and taken some of our data.

the vendor informed harvard eye that the hackers had demanded money to return the data they had taken. after consulting with cybersecurity experts and the fbi, the vendor made the payment. the hackers then returned the data and told the vendor that they had not disclosed the data or kept any copies. the vendor determined, through its investigation, that the hackers might have been able to access harvard eye's data as early as october 24, 2020. the vendor's cybersecurity experts have been monitoring the internet and have not found any evidence that the hackers used or disclosed any of the data.

what information was involved

the information taken by the hackers included some of harvard eye's own patient information. it also included information about patients of alicia surgery center, which harvard eye was using in order to perform administrative services for the surgery center.

the data taken by the hackers might have included your name, address, phone number, email address, date of birth, medical history, health insurance information, medications, and information about treatment you received from harvard eye. if you have had eye surgery at alicia surgery center, the data might also have included medical information related to your surgery. the hackers did not have access to your social security number, driver's license number, other government id number, or credit or debit card information.

what we are doing

when the vendor learned of this incident, it notified the fbi, hired cybersecurity experts, investigated, blocked further access by the hackers, and strengthened its security measures to help prevent future incidents.

at harvard eye and alicia surgery center, we have taken steps to review and analyze the incident, and we will continue our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the security of our patients' data.

notice of data breach

dear first middle last suffix,

we are writing to inform you of a cybersecurity incident that occurred at sequoia capital operations, llc (sequoia). we understand the importance of keeping personal information safe and secure, and we deeply regret that this incident has occurred. below you will find information about what happened, what we are doing, and what you can do.

what happened?

on or about january 20, 2021, we discovered that an unauthorized third party had gained remote access to the business email mailbox of one sequoia employee, with the apparent aim of conducting a wire diversion scam. our investigation has found no evidence of compromise beyond this single mailbox. we quickly took steps to secure our network and began to investigate the incident with the support of outside cybersecurity experts.

the unauthorized access to the mailbox might have allowed the third party to acquire a copy of files containing the personal information of fewer than 1,000 california residents. as part of our investigation, we have analyzed the contents of the affected email mailbox and determined that it contained your personal information, and that the unauthorized third party might have accessed or acquired a copy of it.

what information was involved?

based on our review, the unauthorized third party could have acquired personal information including your <<insert exposed pii>>.

what we are doing

we took prompt steps to address this incident, including contacting law enforcement and engaging outside cybersecurity experts to help remediate and ensure the ongoing security of our systems. as part of these ongoing efforts, we have enhanced cybersecurity protections throughout our environment to detect any future anomalous activity. specifically, we have:

- identified and remediated the configuration that permitted the initial access;
- deployed additional prevention and detection technology at multiple layers to improve visibility into anomalous user activity and malicious email content;
- reviewed the methods we use to store and share sensitive information inside and outside the company, including email message forwarding rules; and
- refreshed our security training with additional emphasis on phishing awareness and proper data handling.

out of an abundance of caution, sequoia has also conducted dark web monitoring to determine whether any of the data from the business email mailbox is being sold or traded by cybercriminals, and we have not seen any indication that the email mailbox data is being exploited for any purpose.

to protect you further, we are offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through experian for 24 months, free of charge. you can find further details below on how to sign up.

what you can do

we strongly encourage you to contact experian and take advantage of the credit monitoring and identity theft protection services we are providing to you free of charge. remain vigilant and carefully review your accounts for any suspicious activity.

if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should change the password and security questions associated with the account, and promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained and any relevant government agency, such as the irs, ssa, or state dmv, as applicable.

if you would like to take additional	the data breach was caused by an unauthorized access to sequoia capital operations, llc's business email mailbox with the aim of conducting a wire diversion scam. the breach was not caused by any physical loss or insider of axlehire inc., but rather by an outside party gaining remote access to sequoia's system. therefore, this is a hack-type breach.

notice of data breach

dear <<first_name>> <<last_name>> :

itochu international inc. (iii) understands the importance of protecting the information we maintain. we are writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved some of your information. this notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you may consider taking.

what happened?
iii recently concluded its investigation of an incident that involved unauthorized access to one employee's email account. upon first suspecting unauthorized access to the employee's email account, we immediately secured the account and launched an investigation. a third-party cybersecurity forensics firm was engaged to assist.

in connection with that investigation, we learned that an unauthorized party gained access to the employee's email account between september 8, 2020, and september 9, 2020. our investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized party actually viewed any emails or attachments in the account. in an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments that may have been viewed in the email account to identify individuals whose personal information may have been accessible to the unauthorized party.

what information was involved?
on december 8, 2020, we determined that the account included an email and/or attachment containing your name and one or more of the following data elements: social security number, driver's license number, and/or financial account number.

what we are doing.
to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we have implemented additional security measures to enhance the security of our network, and we are retraining our employees concerning data retention and security.

what you can do.
while we have no indication that your information was actually viewed by the unauthorized person, or that it has been misused, we wanted to notify you of this incident. as a precaution, we have arranged for kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. your identity monitoring services include credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. for more information on kroll identity monitoring, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please visit the below website. we encourage you to remain vigilant by regularly reviewing your financial account statements for any unauthorized activity. if you see charges or activity you did not authorize, please contact your financial institution immediately.

additional steps you can take
we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts:
there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes:
you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports?
there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze?
a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	the organization experienced unauthorized access to an employee's email account due to a third-party gaining access to the account between september 8th and september 9th, 2020. personal information such as name, social security number, driver's license number, and/or financial account number was potentially accessible to the unauthorized party. the investigation was unable to determine whether any emails or attachments were viewed.

blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. blackbaud notified us and many other institutions on july 16, 2020, that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on blackbaud's network in may 2020. blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that there had been unauthorized access to its systems between february 7, 2020, and may 20, 2020, that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince blackbaud to pay a ransom. blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

initially, blackbaud informed us that the fields in the database backups containing personal information were encrypted and not accessible by the unauthorized individual. however, further investigation determined that this was not the case, and blackbaud informed us of their updated findings on september 29, 2020. following receipt of the notifications about the incident from blackbaud, we launched our investigation and worked with blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved. on november 17, 2020, we determined that the unencrypted blackbaud backup file contained some of your information.

what information was involved?

the blackbaud backup file involved contained your name and social security number. blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual, and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

what you can do

even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. as a precaution, blackbaud is offering you a complimentary membership to identity monitoring and fraud resolution services for two years. this product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. these services are completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more information on the identity monitoring and fraud resolution services, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary two-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in the following pages.

what we are doing

we are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that blackbaud is taking in response. blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

re: notice of data breach

dear <<name 1>>,

backroads is writing to inform you of a recent incident that may affect some of your personal information. you may have been affected due to being the dependent, spouse, or beneficiary of a current or former backroads employee. while we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, we want to provide you with information about the incident, our response, and steps you may take to better protect your personal information, should you feel it necessary to do so.

what happened?

on october 2, 2020, backroads became aware of suspicious activity within its computer network. backroads immediately began an investigation, working with external forensic specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the activity. our investigation determined that certain files within our environment were encrypted and inaccessible. on october 16, 2020, we discovered that certain files had been accessible to unknown actors and that certain personal information was contained in these files. we recognize that it may feel like there was a delay between the initial incident and receiving this notification. from the moment we knew that files were accessible to the unknown actors, we have been working both internally to determine who could have been affected, as well as externally with appropriate authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate globally. thank you for your understanding and patience while we worked through all the necessary details.

what information was involved?

backroads has both legal authority and obligation to maintain personal information for its employees. the forensic investigation confirmed that the following information was stored within one of the impacted network devices and may have been accessible to unknown actors: your name, date of birth, social security number, government-issued id (passport or driver's license, if provided to backroads), financial account information, and health insurance information, if obtained through backroads. while we cannot confirm which piece of your personal information might have been accessed, we are informing employees of the full scope of what could have been compromised due to its presence in impacted files.

what we are doing

the confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information within our custody are among backroads' highest priorities. in order to minimize the chance that latent malware could remain on backroads systems, we are rebuilding our network from the ground up and adding further security measures to better protect against similar incidents in the future.

what you can do

please review the enclosed steps you can take to protect personal information, which contains information on what you can do to better protect against possible misuse of your information.

as an added precaution, backroads is offering you access to one year of credit monitoring and identity protection services through transunion's mytrueidentity (provided by epiq) at no cost to you. details of this offer and instructions on how to enroll in the services are enclosed within this letter.

dear friend of la jolla country day school,

we are writing to inform you that one of our third-party vendors, blackbaud, experienced a cyber incident that may have allowed access to some of your personal information. as a result, you are entitled to free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services.

what happened?

blackbaud is a software service provider that offers engagement and fundraising solutions to non-profit companies, schools, and institutions across the united states. between february and may 20, 2020, blackbaud was the victim of a ransomware attack that allowed a cyber-criminal to access certain personal information, including your name, phone number, address, birth date, and social security number. once blackbaud detected the intrusion, it was able to halt further system access. the cyber-criminal only gained access to certain back-up files in specific blackbaud solutions. blackbaud, in conjunction with the fbi, investigated the incident and ultimately paid a ransom to the cyber-criminal under the assurance that any exfiltrated files would be destroyed. their system was fully restored after ransom payment. blackbaud reports that there has been no evidence of improper use of any of the data files that may have been exposed. blackbaud has already implemented changes to their data security protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.

as part of their continuing investigation, blackbaud discovered that when it merged data from previous versions of some of their solutions into current versions, there were hidden tables containing the older data (which included unencrypted personal information) merged into the new program which were not visible. we were notified of this new exposure on september 29, 2020, and took action to verify and determine scope, which required the cooperation of blackbaud in producing the hidden data files. according to blackbaud, the information was exposed because the company failed to destroy or encrypt certain legacy files after a migration of our files to a new platform.

what pi was exposed?

at this time, we are informed that sensitive personal information, including your name, phone number, address, birth date, and social security number, were exposed. this is older data from the prior legacy versions of the programs that were used prior to migration.

what you can do:

to help you guard against identity theft or other potential fraud as a result of this incident, blackbaud is offering free credit monitoring and fraud assistance services for 24 months. information about how to access these services accompanies this letter. although services are available to you, it is important to remain vigilant and promptly report any suspected fraud to law enforcement. for information on avoiding identity theft, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

in addition, security experts suggest that you contact your financial institution and all major credit bureaus immediately to inform them of such a breach and then take whatever steps are recommended to protect your interests, including the possible placement of a fraud alert on your credit file.

we encourage you to contact cyberscout to enroll in free cyberscout services by going to https://www.cyberscouthq.com/epiq263?ac=263hq1459 and using the enrollment code provided above. please note the deadline to enroll is april 15, 2021.

again, at this time, there is no evidence that your information has been misused. however, we encourage you to take full advantage of this service offering.

enclosed hereto you will find additional information regarding the resources available to you, and the steps that you can take to further protect your personal information.

for more information:

we recognize that you may have questions not addressed in this letter. if you have additional questions, please call our call center at 1-???-???-???? monday through friday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm pacific time. our representatives have been fully versed on the incident and can answer questions or concerns you may have regarding protection of your personal information.

la jolla country day school values the security of your personal data, and we apologize for any inconvenience that this incident has caused.

sincerely,

dave sigal
chief financial officer

contents of data breach notification letter: re: notice of data security incident

dear guest,

we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that has affected some hurtigruten guests' information. our investigations indicate that information for a limited number of guests who booked expedition voyages with two ships, ms fram and ms midnatsol, during a certain time period, has been affected by the incident. for ms fram, the relevant time period is from 2018 to 2020. for ms midnatsol, the relevant time period is from 2016 to 2020. we recently learned that your information has been affected by this incident.

what happened?

on december 14, 2020, we learned that an unauthorized actor gained remote access to our network and encrypted parts of our computer systems. at that time, however, we were unable to determine which guests may have been affected, if any, and what information might have been accessed. we immediately disabled affected computer systems, took down their internet connection to prevent any further intrusion, and launched a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. we understand that hurtigruten was one of many companies that was a victim of this type of intrusion.

what information was involved?

based on our investigations, we have recently determined that your affected information involves:

- name and date of birth;
- if you were sailing with ms midnatsol, your passport number and passport expiration date; and
- for some guests, the affected information involves e-mail address, mailing address, and/or phone number.

based on our investigations to date, the unauthorized actor did not gain access to your credit or debit card information, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, or other government-issued identification card numbers. hurtigruten does not store credit or debit card information.

what we are doing?

as noted above, we immediately took steps to contain the issue and commenced an investigation to determine the data and individuals that may have been affected. we reported this matter to norwegian law enforcement and the norwegian data protection authority (since hurtigruten is based in norway) and the federal bureau of investigation. we also notified other applicable privacy regulatory authorities. over the past years, we have made significant investments in data privacy and cybersecurity. since this incident, we have further strengthened these efforts, and our internal experts are working closely with third-party cybersecurity experts to further enhance the security of our systems and reduce the risk of a similar event happening in the future.

what can you do?

on february 18, 2021, we discovered the unauthorized actor placed some of the above information on a difficult to access part of the web. we do not have any indication of actual harm to affected individuals as a result of this incident, but we still recommend you follow the enclosed additional steps that you can take to protect your personal information. we sincerely regret any concerns or inconvenience that this incident may cause you.

for more information

if you have questions or require further assistance, please contact us via one of these channels:

re: data security incident

dear director whitney,

as outside counsel for americold realty trust, a publicly traded reit focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition, and development of temperature-controlled warehouses, we write to inform you of the recent discovery of a data security incident and to explain the steps the company has taken and continues to take to address it, including notifying potentially impacted individuals and providing them ways with which to protect their personal information.

on november 16, 2020, americold determined that its computer network had been affected by a ransomware incident. the company immediately began an investigation to assess the incident's scope, engaging a third-party cybersecurity firm at the direction of counsel to assist. as a containment measure, the company preemptively shut down its systems and then undertook a secure, managed restoration from backup systems. the company also promptly notified law enforcement and has been cooperating with their investigation of the incident. in addition, the company has taken steps to further strengthen and enhance the security of systems in its network, including updating administrative and technical safeguards.

the company diligently has worked to complete its review of the potentially affected data, engaging external support to assist with the review and locating up-to-date address information. while this review was underway, on december 29, 2020, the company proactively sent letters to all current associates in the united states, offering them a complimentary two-year consumer protection division membership of experian's identityworkssm, which provides identity theft detection and resolution services.

the company completed its review of the data on about february 19, 2021, and found personal information for 3,117 state residents in files that may have been accessed or acquired without authorization. the company is notifying this office and the individual state residents and is providing them with complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft services for 24 months through experian. the company also is sending follow-up notices to the individuals who received the december 29 letter. unaddressed copies of each letter are attached. those letters are to be mailed on march 4. in addition, the company has established a call center to answer consumer questions.

please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions regarding this letter.
