root insurance company (root) understands the importance of protecting personal information. we are writing to inform you about an incident that involved some of your information. this notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you may consider taking.

what happened?

we identified an unusual account creation pattern on january 28, 2021, and now believe that activity began in the week before that date. accounts were being created for individuals with whom root had no prior relationship by using names and dates of birth, which were not obtained from root, to get an insurance quote through our website. we immediately began an investigation and notified law enforcement.

what information was involved?

by creating new accounts, an application prefill process was triggered which populated the following information in the account: your driver's license number, date of birth, and vehicle information (vehicle identification number, year, make and model). please note that you may have been identified in our investigation because you did attempt to get an insurance quote through root's website between january 21 and 31, 2021. your ability to receive a quote or purchase a root insurance policy may have been stopped because out of an abundance of caution we stopped certain quote and policy purchase activity in order to shut down what appeared to be suspicious activity.

after we finished our initial investigation and notified impacted members about what happened, we continued to review the case. during that review, we found more impacted people, including you.

what happened:

on may 7, 2020, the alliance found that many alliance employees' email accounts were accessed illegally by an unknown person. these accounts were accessed for about one hour. the alliance found the issue and immediately shut down the alliance employees' email accounts that were accessed.

- alliance care management program records
- claims information
- date of birth
- demographic information
- medi-cal id number
- medical information
- referral information

the alliance employees' email accounts would not have included financial information and social security numbers.

what we are doing:

contents of data breach notification letter: notice of data breach

i am writing to inform you of an incident involving your personal information.

what happened

on december 24-29, 2020, a file transfer service used by kroger to transfer large data files associated with its money transfer operations, among other services, was compromised. the file transfer service was provided by kroger's vendor, accellion. the compromise resulted in an unauthorized party stealing significant volumes of data and records from a large number of accellion customers, including kroger. according to kroger, it learned of this unauthorized access on january 23, 2021. kroger informed us that the unauthorized access likely occurred between december 24, 2020, and december 29, 2020. kroger has assured us that it no longer uses the impacted service.

kroger had been using accellion to transmit operational reports related to western union money transfers that were initiated or paid out in person at kroger retail locations, as well as retail locations of additional kroger-owned retail brands. these kroger-owned brands include kroger, dillons, ralphs, king scoopers, city market, smith's, fred meyer, frys, qfc, roundys, marianos, and harris teeter.

upon receiving the necessary data from kroger, we immediately began investigating to determine what personal information handled by kroger was affected and which of our valued customers were impacted due to the compromise of kroger's service provider. our investigation determined that some of the affected reports included information about you.

i want to emphasize that western union's information systems were not affected by this incident, and we have no evidence that any money transfers were impacted.

what we are doing

we take this matter very seriously and are fully committed to protecting the privacy and security of our customers' information. as noted above, after learning of this incident, we immediately initiated an investigation. we have confirmed that kroger stopped using the affected file transfer service provided by accellion. although our systems were not impacted, we will be reviewing kroger's security practices and monitoring the circumstances surrounding this event.

to help protect your identity, we are offering complimentary access to experian identity workssm for a period of two years.

if you believe there was fraudulent use of your information as a result of this incident and would like to discuss how you may be able to resolve those issues, please reach out to an experian agent. if, after discussing your situation with an agent, it is determined that identity restoration support is needed, then	there is no clear indication of what type of breach this was as the information provided in the breach notification does not specify whether the breach involved physical loss, unauthorized access, or unintended disclosure.
insufficient information	there is insufficient information provided to determine the type of breach.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear jefit user,

we are writing to inform you of a cyber-incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. please note that no financial data was involved in this breach. we take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously and want to explain what happened and the steps you can take to protect yourself against cybercrime.

in early last month, we became aware of this data breach from a few users' reports and immediately investigated. soon after, we took a series of actions to ensure our system is safe and to further protect your account. upon discovering this breach, we took immediate action to secure our servers and the impacted accounts. we also began an investigation to understand the scope of the incident. we were able to identify the root cause of the data incident and confirmed that other jefit systems were unaffected. we also contacted law enforcement.

at this time, there is no sensitive financial data involved since we never stored customers' payment information. all payment processes were directly handled by google play store, apple app store, or directly processed by the payment gateway company if customers purchased products on our website. nevertheless, we are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution because some other part of your private information was accessed by the perpetrator of the cyber-incident.

the personal and private information that the perpetrator gained access to includes some or possibly all of the following: jefit account username, email address (associated with the account), encrypted password (hashed with unique salt to each account), and ip address when creating the account.

upon discovery of the cyber-attack, we immediately secured and patched the bug. we also conducted a forensic investigation to confirm that no other systems were impacted. we have taken security measures to strengthen our network against similar incidents in the future. we have also implemented a stronger password policy on our product to further protect users' accounts in the future.

we want to make sure you are aware of steps you may take to guard against potential phishing email attacks or other forms of fraud. although all the passwords have been hashed with unique salt (meaning passwords were encrypted) before saving to our system, it is still possible for the perpetrator to decrypt some of them if the passwords were too simple. we encourage you to change your password as soon as you can.

we take the privacy and security of your information seriously and sincerely regret any concerns or inconvenience that the incident may have caused you.

sincerely,

dear insulet customer,

we are writing to inform you that a recent data security incident involving a vendor of insulet corporation (insulet) may have potentially affected some of your protected health information (phi). the incident was disclosed to us by the vendor, cornerstone on-demand (cornerstone), and we have completed an extensive review and investigation to identify potentially affected individuals.

cornerstone did not collect any other phi on our behalf, so no other insulet customer information about you was exposed by the cornerstone breach. we take this event very seriously and have implemented additional security measures to reduce the likelihood of another attack.

on february 2, hagerty's web team noticed an increase in insurance quote requests via our instant quote feature. the high level of quote activity was suspicious and initial investigations indicated that automated bots were submitting fake quotes. hagerty immediately deployed mechanisms to detect, prevent, and block bot activity in our quote system. on february 16, hagerty became aware that this incident was likely part of a widespread cyber-fraud scheme targeting quote systems across many different insurers and insurance agencies. malicious bot activity is increasingly prevalent and can be used to tap into systems to harvest specific online consumer data. based on information known about these widespread attacks, hagerty was able to identify that the bot activity was intended to access individuals' personal information, including drivers license numbers, that was inadvertently embedded in the source code of the quote webpage after submitting a request for a quote, and was therefore accessible to the attackers. while this additional personal information was not visible on the webpage itself, the attacker could search the source code to find it.

what information was involved

our records indicate that your name, drivers license number, and date of birth may have been accessed in early february.

actions we've taken to safeguard your information

we take our responsibility to safeguard your personal information as our utmost priority. we immediately deployed mechanisms to detect, prevent, and block bot activity in our quote feature and have implemented processes and protocols to mitigate this type of activity. as of march 2nd, the quote feature safeguards have successfully prevented any additional bot activity.

when you receive your credit reports, review them carefully. look for accounts or creditor inquiries that you did not initiate or do not recognize. look for information, such as home address and social security number, that is not accurate. if you see anything you do not understand, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report.

we recommend you remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports. we also recommend that you promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and/or the federal trade commission (ftc). you may contact the ftc or your state's regulatory authority to obtain additional information about avoiding identity theft.

fraud alerts:

there are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for at least 90 days. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for 7 years. you can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling the toll-free fraud number of any of the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.

transunion: 1-800-680-7289, fraud.transunion.com

credit freezes:

you may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. placing, lifting, and/or removing a credit freeze from your account is completely free and will not affect your credit score. please contact the three national credit reporting agencies as specified below to find out more information:

equifax: p.o. box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

re: notice of data breach

dear [owner name],

we are writing to inform you about a recent information security incident that may have affected certain pieces of your personal information and to advise you of steps you may take to identify misuse of your personal information. this letter is on behalf of the california state controllers office (sco) unclaimed property division.

what happened?

a sco employee clicked on a link in an email that appeared to come from a trusted outside entity and unknowingly provided an unauthorized user with access to their email account. the unauthorized user had access to the account from march 18, 2021, at 1:42 p.m. to march 19, 2021, at 3:19 p.m. and sent potentially malicious emails to some of the sco employees' contacts.

what information was involved?

sco has reason to believe that the compromised email account had personal identifying information contained in unclaimed property holder reports. these reports are submitted by corporations with whom you have transacted business but, after a period of years, had lost contact with you and your property turned over. (your property may be searched for at www.claimit.ca.gov.) that information potentially included your first and last name, address at the time your property was deemed lost by the corporation, social security number, birth date, and value of property turned over to sco.

what we are doing

the improperly accessed email account was discovered promptly and access removed. sco unclaimed property division personnel immediately began a review of all emails in the account for personal identifying information that may have been viewed. contacts of the sco employee were advised to delete suspicious emails and not click on any links therein.

to assist you in protecting yourself against identity theft, we have arranged to make available to you 24 months of identity theft resolution services provided by experian identityworks sm, at no charge. details on how to enroll are enclosed. please note that you must enroll to take advantage of this free service, and we encourage you to do so.

additional actions to help reduce your chances of identity theft

place a 90-day fraud alert on your credit file

an initial 90-day security alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a victim of fraud. when you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit on an existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the lender should take steps to verify that you have authorized the request. if the creditor cannot verify this, the request should not be satisfied. you may contact one of the credit reporting companies below for assistance.

equifax 1-800-525-6285 www.equifax.com
experian 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com
transunion 1-800-680-7289 www.transunion.com

place a security freeze on your credit file

if you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, a security freeze might be right for you. placing a freeze on your credit report will prevent lenders and others from accessing your credit report entirely, which will prevent them from extending credit. with a security freeze in place, you will be required to take special steps when you wish to apply for any type of credit. this process is also completed through each of the credit reporting companies. the cost of placing, temporarily lifting, and removing a security freeze varies by state, generally $5 to $20 per action at each credit reporting company.

order your free annual credit reports

visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 877-322-8228. once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. verify all information is correct. if you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

manage your personal information

take steps such as carrying only essential documents with you, being aware of whom you are sharing your personal information with, and shredding receipts, statements, and other sensitive information.

use tools from credit providers

carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card, and other account statements. be proactive and create alerts on credit cards and bank accounts to notify you of activity. if you discover unauthorized or suspicious activity on your credit report or by any other means, file an identity theft report with your local police and contact a credit reporting company.

consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

upon completion of these activities, nwf moved to notify those whose payment card information may be impacted. the information potentially affected included customer order and payment information, such as name, address, payment card number, expiration date, and cvv number.

notice to iowa residents

additionally, nwf is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank. nwf is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, information the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud. nwf is also providing written notice of this incident to other state regulators and the consumer reporting agencies, as required.

what information was involved?

in an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments contained in the email accounts to identify individuals whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized party. on february 19, 2021, we determined that the accounts included an email and/or attachment containing your <<b2b_text_1(impacteddata)>>

contents of data breach notification letter: re: notice of data security incident

dear <<name 1>>,

we are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have involved your personal information maintained by la clinica de la raza (la clinica). on january 28, 2021, la clinica became aware that malware had been deployed on certain la clinica systems which store information, including personal information, for the organization. upon learning of the incident, la clinica immediately took steps to stop access to these systems, including permanently disconnecting the affected systems from other la clinica systems and its overall network. la clinica also began an immediate investigation of the incident with the support of a third-party forensics company. on february 26, 2021, la clinica's investigation determined that the malware was deployed by an unauthorized individual or entity who gained unauthorized access to la clinica's systems. upon learning of the unauthorized access, la clinica immediately took additional mitigation steps and security measures, including deploying additional measures to monitor the organization's systems and technology infrastructure.

la clinica's ongoing investigation has determined that unauthorized access to the affected systems occurred, and ended, on january 12, 2021. based on the investigation to date, we reasonably believe that relatively few documents were likely viewed by the unauthorized party. however, our investigation could not definitively conclude that the unauthorized party did not access, use or disclose certain information and documents stored in the affected la clinica systems, which may have included some of the following information: your full name, date of birth, phone number, home address, health insurance information, and certain health information such as dates of service, diagnosis, test results, and treatment information related to care received at la clinica. social security numbers and financial account information were not stored in the affected systems and therefore were not involved in this incident. further, based on our investigation and security practices, we have no reason to believe that there has been any improper access to la clinica's electronic medical record or billing systems.

la clinica has taken, and will continue to take, steps to prevent this type of incident from happening again, including enhancing our data security, implementing additional technology safeguards including enhanced intrusion detection and prevention, securing login credentials, enhanced workforce training, and other cybersecurity risk prevention measures. we have also reviewed our security policies and procedures to ensure that they sufficiently protect against further incidents of this type. in addition, we notified federal law enforcement authorities about the incident and will continue to cooperate with their investigation.

please review the enclosed information about identity theft protection section included with this letter. this section describes steps you can take to help protect your identity, including recommendations by the federal trade commission regarding identify theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file if you wish to do so.

we sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern caused by this incident. we take our responsibility to protect the personal information of our patients very seriously. if you have questions or concerns about this incident, please call 855-654-0864, monday through friday, between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. pacific time.

we are writing to notify you of a security incident affecting the security of your manhunt account credentials.

what happened?

on march 2, 2021, manhunt discovered that an attacker gained access to a database that stored account credentials for manhunt users. the attacker downloaded the usernames, email addresses and passwords for a subset of our users. we immediately took steps to remediate the threat and reset the passwords of affected users.

what information was involved?

the data elements accessed by the unauthorized attacker included your manhunt username, password, and email address used to register your account. we have no evidence that users pictures, messages, or other profile information were acquired by the attacker. as we do not transmit or store any payment card information, no payment card information was exposed as a result of this incident.

what we are doing

manhunt takes your privacy and security seriously. when we discovered this incident, we immediately took steps to contain the intrusion and remediate the threat that led to the unauthorized access. we also reset the passwords for affected user accounts and retained a third-party forensics consultant to assist us in investigating what happened and confirm that there is no ongoing unauthorized access to our systems.

what you can do

we have reset your account password. so, if you haven't done so already, you will be prompted to create a new password the next time you log in. we strongly encourage you to select a unique password that you have not used for another website or account. if you used your previous manhunt account password on other sites, we urge you to change those passwords as well. additionally, be vigilant for phishing messages purporting to be from manhunt or claiming to have information about your manhunt account. manhunt will never ask you for your password or other sensitive information via email. you should also never click on links in emails from senders you do not know. if you notice any unusual activity on your manhunt account or if you receive any unusual communication purporting to be from manhunt, please contact us using the contact information below.

steps you can take to help protect personal information:

you have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. the security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report.

as an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. should you wish to learn more about security freezes and fraud alerts, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:

we are writing to inform you that hamilton beach brands, inc. recently discovered unauthorized computer code on its ecommerce website (www.hamiltonbeach.com) on february 4, 2021. we immediately removed the unauthorized code and began an investigation. a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with our investigation. the code was capable of obtaining information entered by customers during the checkout process and sending that information out of our system. on march 12, 2021, the investigation determined that an unauthorized person could have accessed information entered by some customers during the checkout process for orders attempted or placed between december 18, 2020, and february 4, 2021.

the information that could have been copied includes contact information such as first and last name, shipping and billing address, email address, and phone number. payment card information such as payment card number, expiration date, and card verification code for the payment card ending in <<variable data>> could also have been accessed.

hamilton beach has notified law enforcement and is cooperating with their investigation. we have also notified the payment card networks so that they can inform the banks that issued the cards. we worked to ensure the unauthorized person was no longer able to collect customer information and are taking measures to enhance the security of our site.

we encourage you to closely review your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. you should immediately report unauthorized charges to the bank that issued your card because payment card network rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely reported.

if you have any further questions or concerns, we established a dedicated call center, which can be reached by calling 855-654-0889 monday through friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. eastern time.

we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and regret that this occurred.

sincerely,

chuck vion
senior manager, digital marketing

additional steps you can take:

we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

equifax, po box 740241, atlanta, ga 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
experian, po box 2002, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
transunion, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	unauthorized computer code was discovered on an ecommerce website which was capable of obtaining information during the checkout process and sending that information out of the system. an unauthorized person could have accessed information entered by some customers during the checkout process for orders attempted or placed between december 18, 2020, and february 4, 2021. payment card information could have also been accessed.

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam:

we represent ag solutions it llc (asi) located at 2803 n. nebraska avenue, york, nebraska 68467, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to eight hundred twenty (820) iowa residents. this notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. by providing this notice, asi does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of iowa law, the applicability of the iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

nature of the data event

on or about january 11, 2021, asi became aware of potential unauthorized access to its network. asi immediately began an investigation, with the assistance of counsel and third-party forensics specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the event. on january 29, 2021, asi confirmed that folders on its systems may have been accessed or removed from its systems without authorization. asi therefore undertook a time-intensive, thorough review of the potentially impacted folders and its internal files and systems in order to identify the information that was potentially impacted and to whom it related. on february 25, 2021, asi determined that one or more of the folders contained personal information. asi then undertook a diligent review of its internal files to identify the individuals to whom the data relates and the appropriate contact information for those individuals, which was completed on march 23, 2021. asi thereafter worked to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible.

the information that could have been subject to unauthorized access includes name and social security number.

notice to iowa residents

on april 12, 2021, asi provided written notice of this incident to affected individuals, which includes eight hundred twenty (820) iowa residents. written notice was provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon discovering the event, asi moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of asi systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. asi is also working to implement additional safeguards and training to its employees.	the data breach was a result of potential unauthorized access to ag solutions it llc (asi)'s network on january 11, 2021, which was confirmed on january 29, 2021. upon investigation, asi determined that folders on its systems may have been accessed or removed without authorization. therefore, it was a hack by an outside party or infected by malware.

dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>:

the seven hills school is writing to notify you of a data security incident that occurred at one of our vendors, blackbaud, inc. (blackbaud). this notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

what happened?

blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. blackbaud notified us and many other institutions on july 16, 2020, that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on blackbaud's network in may 2020. blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, which determined that there had been unauthorized access to its systems between february 7, 2020, and may 20, 2020, where backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince blackbaud to pay a ransom. blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

initially, blackbaud informed us that the fields in the database backups containing personal information were encrypted and not accessible by the unauthorized individual. as a result, we posted a notice on the jagzone explaining our understanding at the time. however, further investigation determined that this was not the case, and blackbaud informed us of their updated findings on september 29, 2020. following receipt of the notifications about the incident from blackbaud, we launched our investigation and worked with blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved. on january 4, 2021, we determined that the blackbaud backup file may have contained some of your information.

what information was involved?

the blackbaud backup file involved contained your name and social security number. blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and that there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused or disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

what you can do:

even though we have no evidence that your personal information has been misused, we wanted to let you know this happened and assure you we take it very seriously. as a precaution, blackbaud is offering you a complimentary membership to identity monitoring and fraud resolution services for two years. this product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. these services are completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more information on the identity monitoring and fraud resolution services, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary two-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in the following pages.

what we are doing:

we are notifying you of this incident and sharing the steps that we, and blackbaud, are taking in response. blackbaud has informed us that they identified and fixed the vulnerability associated with this incident, implemented several changes that will better protect your data from any subsequent incidents, and are undertaking additional efforts to harden their environment through enhancements to access management, network segmentation, and deployment of additional endpoint and network-based platforms.

for more information:

we regret that this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience. should you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact our incident response line at 1-855-723-1666 monday through friday from 6:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. pacific time.

dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

i am writing to inform you of a data security incident recently experienced by fpi management (fpi) that may have impacted your personal information. fpi takes the privacy and security of all information within its possession very seriously, which is why i am writing to notify you of this incident and to inform you of steps that can be taken to help safeguard your information.

what happened: on august 14, 2020, fpi learned that it had experienced a data security incident that disrupted access to certain of its systems. upon discovering this incident, fpi took immediate steps to secure its systems prior to restoration. in addition, fpi retained independent cybersecurity experts to conduct an investigation in order to determine what happened. fpi learned that an unauthorized third party had gained access to certain fpi systems and that personal information stored on such systems was accessed or acquired without authorization. on march 3, 2021, following a thorough review of potentially impacted information, fpi learned that your personal information may have been accessed or acquired without authorization as a result of this incident. fpi then worked diligently to provide notification of this incident.

please note that fpi is not aware of the misuse of any potentially impacted information in connection with this incident, and that fpi is notifying potentially impacted individuals out of an abundance of caution.

what we are doing: when fpi learned of this incident, fpi immediately began containment, mitigation, and restoration efforts. as set forth above, fpi also launched an investigation and engaged independent cybersecurity experts to determine what happened and whether sensitive information was impacted. in addition, fpi implemented additional security measures to further harden its digital environment in an effort to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. finally, fpi reported this incident to the federal bureau of investigation and will provide any assistance needed to hold the perpetrators accountable.

in connection with this incident, and out of an abundance of caution, fpi is offering complimentary identity theft protection services through experian identityworkssm. enrollment instructions can be found on the next page of this letter.

we are writing to inform you that the fort hays state university foundation, along with many other institutions, were notified by blackbaud, inc. of a security incident. blackbaud is the vendor that the fhsu foundation uses to record and store information related to alumni and philanthropic giving to the institution. this notice explains the incident and measures taken in response.

blackbaud has assured us that the backup file containing your information has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe that any data was or will be misused, disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.

what happened

blackbaud is a cloud-based software company that provides services to thousands of schools, hospitals, and other non-profits. on july 16, 2020, blackbaud notified the fhsu foundation and many other institutions that it had discovered an attempted ransomware attack on blackbaud's network in may 2020. blackbaud reported that it conducted an investigation, determined that backup files containing information from its clients had been taken from its network, and an attempt was made to encrypt files to convince blackbaud to pay a ransom. blackbaud paid a ransom and obtained confirmation that the files that had been removed had been destroyed. the time period of unauthorized access was between february 7 to may 20, 2020. blackbaud reported that it has been working with law enforcement.

upon learning of the incident from blackbaud, we conducted our own investigation of the blackbaud services we use and the information provided by blackbaud to determine what information was involved in the incident. we worked with blackbaud to identify the individuals whose information may have been involved and determined on february 25, 2021, that the backup files contained certain unencrypted information pertaining to you.

what information was involved

the backup file involved contained your name and social security number. again, blackbaud has assured us that the backup file has been destroyed by the unauthorized individual and there is no reason to believe any data was or will be misused, disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. additionally, we have taken steps to ensure that the files containing your information have been removed from the blackbaud database.

although we are unaware of any actual misuse of your information, we are providing notice to you and other potentially affected customers about the incident, and about tools you can use to protect yourself against possible fraud.

what happened?

an unknown, unauthorized intruder or intruders appears to have gained access to our hosted website servers and uploaded malware to our website www.bladehq.com, potentially gaining the capacity to skim customer transaction data as it was being entered by the customers purchasing or attempting to purchase our merchandise. our investigation indicates that the intruders may have had this skimming capability from january 7, 2021, through march 22, 2021, and on april 11, 2021. the attackers may have gained access to customer transaction information if the customer entered new or updated information at the site during that time. because you entered or changed your card information or personal information at bladehq.com during the suspected period of intrusion, we are notifying you about this security incident.

you may wonder why you are hearing about the incident now. when we first became aware of potentially unusual activity on our website in late march, we immediately hired cybersecurity experts and forensic investigators to assist in our investigation. applicable legal requirements and best practices require that we conduct a complete investigation and cooperate and follow the required protocols of applicable governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions. we are also required by law to ensure that certain additional steps be followed before notifying customers. now that those steps and requirements have been completed and our investigation concluded, we are reaching out to you.

what information was involved?

in the cases mentioned above, information that the intruder may have had access to includes your first and last name, address, email address, and any debit or credit card numbers with expiration dates and cvv codes that you may have entered on our website.

what we are doing.

blade hq values your privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. we have retained the services of a qualified cybersecurity forensic investigation firm to contain the breach, conduct a thorough review of the intrusion, and to ensure the security of the website now and in the future. the intruders' access and malware have been removed from our website, and we have deployed new servers and implemented additional security measures to prevent a recurrence of such an attack and to protect the privacy of our valued customers. we are also working closely with major credit card suppliers and governmental authorities to ensure that the incident is properly addressed.

re: notice of data breach

dear smith & company clients,

we are writing to inform you about a recent incident that may have involved your personal information on behalf of smith & company cpas. this follows up our email on april 3, 2021, when we first reported the incident.

what happened?

we recently discovered that we were targeted by cybercriminals trying to obtain client data through our third-party software provider, intuit.

on march 23, 2021, intuit informed us that our electronic filing id number used for tax filings with the internal revenue service (irs) was compromised. we immediately notified the irs directly of the fraudulent activity, ceased the transmission of all returns potentially impacted, and worked with intuit's fraud department to reapply for a new, secure electronic filing id number for all tax filings going forward. we are proceeding with an abundance of precaution in this unfortunate situation, having notified all of our clients already of the potentially fraudulent activity in a prior email.

what data was potentially involved?

we believe that the client data files impacted may have included personal information associated with individual tax returns, such as full names, addresses, date of births, social security numbers, bank account deposit number, and other tax identification information.

what are we doing?

we are taking this incident very seriously by working with our expert information technology organization, a leading cyber security firm, intuit's fraud department, and the irs to swiftly remedy the situation and take important precautionary security measures to proactively protect our firm and our clients going forward. these measures include, but are not limited to, upgrading our servers, reinforcing our firewalls, administering vulnerability scans, and strengthening internal security protocols.

what can you do?

in conjunction with the irs, we recommend the following:

- get an identity protection pin from the irs. starting this year, you can opt into using an ip pin with the irs to confirm your identity when filing your tax return. here is the link to the irs site to register for the ip pin: https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin
- know the signs of identity theft. the irs has a helpful guide for taxpayers: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/taxpayer-guide-to-identity-theft
- remain vigilant and frequently review all credit card activity and account statements for potentially fraudulent activity.
- request free credit reports be sent to you. under u.s. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. we recommend periodically obtaining credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free 1-877-322-8228. you may also contact the three major credit bureaus listed below directly to request a free copy of your credit report. when you get your credit report, review it carefully. look for accounts you did not open. look in the inquiries section for names of creditors from whom you have not requested credit. some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names; the credit bureau will be able to tell if this is the case. look in the personal information section for any inaccuracies in information (such as home address and social security number). if you see anything you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone number on the report. errors may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. you should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and corrected. if there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in writing. information that cannot be explained should also be reported to your local police or sheriff's office because it may signal criminal activity.
- place security freezes. you have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. this will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. the security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, a security freeze takes control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of future requests or applications you make for a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving credit. by federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report. if you want to place a security freeze, please contact the major consumer reporting agencies listed below:

to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

- a legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or id card, military identification, etc.);
- if you are a victim of identity theft, a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

- place an initial or extended fraud alert. as an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your file at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on your credit file. when a fraud alert appears on your credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify your identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. if you want to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies listed below:

re: notice of vendor breach of unsecured protected health information

doctors medical center of modesto (the hospital, we, or us) is committed to protecting your personal and medical information. this commitment includes notifying you if we believe that an incident may have exposed your medical information to any unintended individual(s).

on april 2, 2021, we learned that patient information provided to a former vendor, medifies, was potentially made publicly accessible to the internet as a result of a misconfigured software update on a server used by a medifies contractor for software development. medifies provided virtual waiting room services to the hospital. upon discovery of the incident, we immediately contacted medifies to remove the information from the internet-facing server, which they removed the same day, and launched an investigation. medifies also retained a third-party forensic firm to investigate the incident. medifies's investigation determined that the software update that caused the patient information to be made publicly available occurred in december 2019.

the patient information potentially involved in this incident included your first and last name, address, email address, date of birth, general procedure information, procedure date, physician name, and the name, address, email address, and cell phone of significant others who may have subscribed to receive updates regarding your procedure. please note that not all data fields may have been involved for every individual. the limited information which was inadvertently involved did not list any medications, test results, or prognosis. it also did not include any individual's social security number, credit or debit card number, insurance/government plan, medical record number, or financial account information.

the protection of patient information is of the utmost importance to us, and we regret that this incident occurred. although we previously ended our relationship with medifies, we have continued to coordinate with them during the course of its investigation to ensure that your information remains protected. if you have any questions or would like additional information about the incident, please call toll-free at 1-877-583-2412. the call center is open monday through friday from 8:00 am until 5:00 pm (pdt) and is closed on weekends and legal holidays.

date:_________________

dear ________________________,

we are contacting you regarding a data security incident we discovered on april 17, 2021, at clearvoiceresearch.com, llc (clearvoice). you are receiving this notice because you have used clearvoice to sign up for a profile to participate in market research surveys, and your personal information was accessed. the privacy and protection of the personal information of our survey respondents are matters we take very seriously, and we recommend that you closely review the information provided in this notice for suggestions on how to protect yourself against potential misuse of your information.

1. what happened?

on april 17, 2021, we received an email from an individual (unauthorized user) stating he accessed a backup file of one of our databases containing profile information of survey participants from august and september of 2015. this database was later discovered to have been posted online, for purchase by the public.

2. what data was affected?

the data that was accessible may include the following: contact information from 2015 (name, e-mail address, home address, phone number, date of birth), passwords from 2015, and, as applicable, responses to various questions you may have answered as part of creating your profile on our platform which may include, but not be limited to, health condition, political affiliation, and ethnicity. it is important to note that the data that was accessible did not include national insurance numbers, social security numbers, id numbers, credit card numbers, other financial information, or data collected from specific surveys you may have taken part in.

3. what are the potential consequences for you?

it cannot be ruled out that the data sets mentioned above may be misused, and you may be contacted for purposes such as advertising. further, it cannot be excluded that the accessible information may be used to prepare personal profiles, which could possibly be used in a commercial or political context.

4. what we are doing.

upon receipt of the information from the unauthorized user, we immediately launched an investigation into the matter. within an hour of receiving the email from the unauthorized user, we located the backup file, secured it, and eliminated any further exposure to the file in the cloud service. we also conducted a comprehensive search of all of our databases and files and determined that no other files had been exposed, and other files were properly secured. we will continue to take steps necessary to minimize any disruption that this compromise may have caused and to prevent such incidents in the future. furthermore, clearvoice forced a password reset for all persons that participate in our panels and members whose information had potentially been exposed. further, clearvoice has implemented additional security measures designed to prevent a recurrence of such an incident and to protect the privacy of your data.

5. what you can do.

given the types of information that were accessible as part of this incident, we do not believe that there is a risk of identity theft from this incident. however, we encourage you to take usual prudent precautions with your personal information. you should not open email or text messages from any unknown sender. you should never open untrusted web links. you should never provide personal information via email or over the phone to any unverified entity. if you continue to use the same password as in 2015, even for other accounts or platforms, there is a risk that an unauthorized access of your accounts may occur, and you should change your password settings of those other accounts respectively.

6. for more information.

we have set up a webpage https://hosted.clearvoicesurveysmail.com/fa32/ to provide information, which will be updated, as additional information becomes available. if you have further questions regarding this incident, please email steven ray at datainquiries@clearvoiceresearch.com.

we truly apologize for this incident and regret any inconvenience to our panel participants.

sincerely,

the clearvoice research executive team	the breach was caused by an outside party who accessed a backup file of one of clear voice's databases containing profile information of survey participants from august and september of 2015, and the data was later discovered to have been posted online for purchase by the public.

what happened?

on march 3, 2021, ncma detected unusual activity on its computer systems. upon detection of the activity, we shut down portions of our network, reset passwords, and commenced an investigation that included working with computer forensic specialists to determine the nature and scope of the event. during the course of the investigation, we learned that unauthorized access to the ncma network began on february 19, 2021, and culminated in unauthorized encryption of certain ncma servers and workstations on march 3, 2021. on or about march 29, 2021, we confirmed that certain data from our systems was taken in the event. as a result, ncma is providing this notice that information held by ncma may have been viewed or taken by an unauthorized actor.

while we currently have no evidence that any information was used to commit identity theft or fraud, the types of information potentially acquired included: names, contact information, social security numbers, driver's license/state identification numbers, financial account information, medical record number/patient identification numbers, medical information (such as medical history, diagnosis, treatment information, physician information, and/or prescription medication information) as well as health insurance information.

what we are doing.

steps you can take to protect personal information

monitor your accounts

under u.s. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, equifax, experian, and transunion. to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. you may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

as an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. the credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);
2. social security number;
3. date of birth;
4. addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. a legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or id card, military identification, etc.); and
7. a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

should you wish to place a fraud alert or credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

what happened?

i am writing to let you know that between january 20, 2021, and february 12, 2021, unknown malicious actors targeted the 21st century auto quoting system to obtain various individuals' personal information. while we are still investigating this to determine exactly how this occurred, we believe your driver's license number may have been obtained. upon discovery of this activity, we took immediate steps to prevent access to personal information and began working to identify the potentially affected individuals. we are notifying you and any consumers who we believe were affected by this incident. however, we believe some people receiving this letter may have made valid quote requests or had someone in their household make valid quote requests on our website during the applicable time period. therefore, if a valid quote request was made on our website during the relevant time period, then it is possible that your information may not have been exposed in this incident.

a fraud alert instructs issuers of credit to use more than normal scrutiny for any request for new or additional credit. this adds a layer of protection, but it might limit your ability to obtain instant credit (for example, an instant credit card offered by a retail store). you can place a fraud alert by contacting one of three national consumer reporting agencies directly at:

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts:

there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud-an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes:

you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports?

there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com

transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com

equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze?

a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	state automobile mutual insurance company was hacked by an unknown actor who used addresses not obtained from state auto to initiate quotes for auto insurance for individuals with whom state auto had no prior relationship, which led to an unusual pattern within an application process normally used by their agents to obtain quotes for prospective customers. the activity occurred between march 11 and march 31, 2021, and personal information such as first and last name, driver's license number, date of birth and/or gender was accessed.

security breach notifications
office of the attorney general of iowa
1305 e. walnut street
des moines, iowa 50319-0106

re: notification pursuant to iowa code 715c.2

dear attorney general miller:

we are writing on behalf of our client, insurance technologies corporation (itc), to notify you of a breach of security involving the personal information of six hundred fifty-eight (658) individual insureds who reside in iowa. itc is submitting this notification on behalf of its insurance broker customers who opted in to have itc send written notification to your office in accordance with iowa code 715c.2. the names of the customers on whose behalf itc is submitting this notification and the total numbers of their potentially affected insureds who reside in iowa, respectively, are attached hereto at exhibit a. itc notified the customers listed in exhibit a on march 30, 2021.

nature of the incident

itc provides insurance brokers with technology solutions including a software application called agencymatrix, which offers a cloud-based agency management system that allows brokers to effectively manage their business. on february 27, 2021, an unauthorized third party gained access to the agencymatrix application and acquired certain personal information of insureds that was stored in that application. upon learning of the issue, itc immediately commenced an investigation through which it contained the incident on march 4, 2021. itc also notified federal law enforcement and retained an independent forensics firm to assist with the investigation and analysis of the incident.

as part of its investigation, itc determined that the personal information involved in this incident may have included individuals' full names and social security numbers and/or drivers license numbers, and possibly their dates of birth and/or usernames and passwords to the agencymatrix application. to date, itc has no evidence that any of the information potentially involved in this incident has been misused.

steps taken related to the incident

itc provided substitute notice in usa today on april 29, 2021. itc began mailing notifications to the potentially affected iowa residents on may 10, 2021, via u.s. mail on behalf of its insurance broker customers who opted in for itc to do so. a sample copy of the notice that was sent to those individuals is attached hereto at exhibit b. in order to be fully transparent, we attached a sample copy of the notice that includes the most comprehensive description of personal information involved in this incident. with that said, not all of these data elements apply to the entire population of individuals affected. thus, we sent the same version of this notice with different variations of data elements affected with respect to each iowa resident.

out of an abundance of caution, itc provided the potentially affected iowa residents whose social security numbers and/or drivers license numbers may have been involved in this incident with credit monitoring and identity protection services through transunion interactive, a subsidiary of transunion, at no charge for a period of twelve (12) months, and has also set up a dedicated support line that will be staffed to answer any questions individuals may have about this incident or the services available to them. shortly after discovering this issue, itc reset all valid passwords to the agencymatrix application.

in response to this incident, and as part of itc's continuous commitment to enhance the security of its infrastructure, itc has implemented additional security measures to help protect the privacy of the information stored on its systems. itc continues to evaluate and modify its security measures, not only in response to this specific incident, but also in response to the ever-changing security landscape.

if you have any further inquiries concerning this notification, please do not hesitate to contact me.

sincerely,

steps you can take to protect personal information

monitor your accounts

we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. under u.s. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, equifax, experian, and transunion. to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. you may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

as an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. the credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);

2. social security number;

3. date of birth;

4. addresses for the prior two to five years;

5. proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;

6. a legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or id card, etc.); and

7. a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

should you wish to place a credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit. how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

additional information for residents of the following states:

connecticut: you may contact and obtain information from your state attorney general at: connecticut attorney general's office, 165 capitol ave, hartford, ct 06106, 1-860-808-5318, www.ct.gov/ag

re: notice of data breach

dear john smith,

health plan of san joaquin (hpsj) is writing to let you know that one or more people outside of hpsj have accessed some of our employee email accounts without our permission. as a result, some of your information may have been seen by them, and although hpsj has no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of information, there is a risk that this information has been, or could be misused. we are offering free resources to help prevent this from happening to you. if you would like to use these services, you must sign up for them by september 30, 2021, following the directions provided in the materials that follow. this letter has more information about what happened, our response, and the free resources that can help you protect your personal information from possible misuse. the confidentiality, privacy, and security of your information is one of our highest priorities.

what happened?

on october 12, 2020, we learned of unusual activity affecting hpsj's email system. at that time, hpsj was not aware of any unauthorized access to hpsj's email system, but we launched an investigation to learn everything we could about what happened, and brought in a computer specialist that has expertise in email security incidents like this one to assist our investigation.

from our investigation, on october 23, 2020, we learned that an unknown person(s) accessed certain hpsj employee email accounts between september 26, 2020, and october 12, 2020. once we identified the affected email accounts, we immediately changed the passwords for those email accounts to stop any further access by the unknown person(s).

next, we reviewed the messages in the email accounts to determine if any personal information was in the affected hpsj email accounts so that we could contact anyone whose information may have been seen without authorization. we are sending you this letter because your information was present in the affected hpsj email accounts. we do not know if your information was actually seen by the unknown person(s) who accessed the accounts. we only know that your information may have been seen because it was present in the email accounts that were accessed.

what information was involved?

the information present in the email accounts at the time of the incident may have included your first and last name as well as your hpsj member id number, social security number, claim id number, date of birth, health insurance information, medical id number, medical record number (mrn), prescription information, and treatment information.

what we are doing.

although we do not know for sure that any of your information was seen or misused, we are notifying you about what happened so that you may take further steps to help protect yourself from identity theft or fraud if you wish to do so.

we are offering you free identity monitoring services for 12 months through equifax (a private company with a lot of experience helping people with matters like this) as an added precaution. if you would like to use these resources, you must sign up for them by september 30, 2021. hpsj will pay for the cost of these services. more information about these services is included with this letter on a separate page with the heading, steps you may take to help protect your information.

what you can do.

we also recommend that you watch out for identity theft and any signs of fraud using your personal information. you should review your bank and credit card account statements, credit reports, and any insurance benefits or other similar forms for suspicious activity or errors. please also read the enclosed steps you may take to help protect your information.

for more information.

we understand you may have questions that are not answered in this letter. if you have questions, please contact our free help line at 1-800-691-6229 (tty: 1-855-535-1808), monday through friday, between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. pacific time. an interpreter will be provided free of charge if you need it.

protecting your information and protecting you from identity theft or fraud is very important to us, and we are committed to working with you to make sure that happens.

sincerely,

health plan of san joaquin

dear zocdoc user,

notice of data breach

at zocdoc, we understand how important your personal information is, and we work hard to protect it. out of an abundance of caution and in compliance with regulatory requirements, we are writing to inform you that some past or current staff members at medical or dental practices where you previously booked an appointment may have had access to zocdoc's system, which contains your personal information (as detailed in the what information was involved section of this letter), after their authorization was changed or revoked. importantly, we have no reason to believe, at this time, that your personal information has been misused in any way.

what happened

as you know, zocdoc allows you to book appointments with doctors who list available appointment times at their medical or dental practices on our platform. each practice registered with zocdoc receives usernames that allow staff members to access zocdoc's system (the provider portal), and view appointments and other information you provide when booking an appointment.

beginning in august 2020, we learned of programming errors that allowed some past or current practice staff members to access the provider portal after their usernames and passwords were intended to be removed, deleted, or otherwise limited. notably, these practices and their current and former staff members have direct obligations to maintain the security and confidentiality of the personal information of their patients, and we have no reason at this time to believe that your information was disclosed outside of these practices and staff members.

we have notified each practice affected by these errors so that they may conduct an internal assessment as an additional precaution. it is possible that you may receive a separate notification from these practices (or the health system with whom they are affiliated).

what information was involved

to the extent that any personal information was accessed, it would include your: name, email address, phone number, and appointment history (i.e. the times and dates of your past appointments) with that practice, and additional information such as insurance member id, social security number, and any relevant medical history that you may have provided to the practice via zocdoc in connection with an appointment booked through our service. if you used your zocdoc account to book an appointment for another individual, or referenced a primary or secondary insurance holder other than yourself on your check-in forms, any personal information you provided about these individuals may also have been accessible.

it is important to note that the following types of information could not have been accessed, because zocdoc does not collect or store such information: credit card numbers, debit card or pin numbers, bank account information, radiological or diagnostic reports, or any medical records from a healthcare provider regarding your treatment.

what we are doing

as soon as we learned of these programming errors, we launched a thorough investigation of our software and code. we repaired these errors, and the affected usernames can no longer access our system. we have also strengthened our security practices and are taking	based on the information provided, it appears that the breach was caused by the actions of past or current staff members at medical or dental practices where the user had booked an appointment. zocdoc's system, which contains the user's personal information, was accessed after these employees' authorization was changed or revoked.

1. full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);
2. social security number;
3. date of birth;
4. addresses for the prior two to five years;

dear sir or madam:

on behalf of our client accucom corporation (accucom), we provide this letter to your office as notice of a recent data security incident.

on december 16, 2020, accucom became aware of the existence of unauthorized code running on its website's databases. accucom immediately removed the code, notified the fbi, reconfigured access controls, changed passwords, and retained national data security experts. accucom confirmed that from may 25, 2020, through december 16, 2020, the unauthorized code may have copied accucom customers' names and credit card details. no social security numbers or other financial account information were at risk. a total of 301,065 individuals, including 2,340 iowa residents, may have been affected by this data security incident.

accucom does not collect its customers' addresses but did not want to rely entirely on substitute notice so it engaged in lengthy requests for assistance from all the credit card issuers involved. all but one credit card brand refused to assist in mailing notices to potentially affected individuals, resulting in notice being mailed to 46 iowa residents. individual notice to these 46 iowa residents was provided on may 27, 2021. with regard to the remaining affected individuals who accucom was unable to identify mailing addresses for, accucom provided these individuals notice via email, mass media notice, and a posting on the accucom website. a copy of the mailed letter and emails provided to potentially affected iowa residents is attached hereto.

please feel free to contact me with any questions at 716-898-2102 or dgreene@beckage.com.

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	the victor valley union high school district computer systems were infected with malware and data on these systems was subsequently accessed by an unauthorized party.

under u.s. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, equifax, experian, and transunion. to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. you may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

as an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. the credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);
2. social security number;
3. date of birth;
4. addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. a legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or id card, military identification, etc.); and
7. a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

should you wish to place a fraud alert or credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

re: notice of data breach

dear <<name 1>>,

we are writing to advise you of an incident (incident) that may involve unauthorized access to some of your personal information on behalf of progrexion asg, inc. (progrexion), located at 257 east 200 south, salt lake city, ut 84111. set forth below is important information concerning the incident along with some resources that may help you protect against the possibility of misuse of your information.

what happened?

on april 8, 2021, progrexion discovered search patterns that indicated a malicious third-party was using progrexion's public-facing platforms to request certain information to help individuals decide if progrexion's assistance is required. while the information the malicious third-party obtained did not include your social security number or any passwords or access codes to accounts that you maintain, it appears that the malicious third-party may have already possessed this or similar information about you from some source other than progrexion. the malicious third-party used this information to access progrexion's public-facing platforms to possibly view your fico score, account number or institution identity (e.g., name of a bank), and limited details about that account (e.g., if any payments were late).

what information was involved?

the information that was potentially involved in the incident may have included your fico score, account numbers or institution identity (e.g., name of a bank), and limited details about that account (e.g., if any payments were late, balances, and the like). it is important to note that the third-party did not access from progrexion your social security number, or any passwords or access codes to accounts that you maintain.

contents of data breach notification letter: subject: mcccd data security incident investigation complete

dear <<name>>,

we are writing to inform you that the maricopa county community colleges districts (mcccd) has completed its forensic investigation into the data security incident that occurred on march 16, 2021. please read this email in its entirety for more information on the incident, mcccd's response and findings, and steps you can take to further protect yourself.

what happened?

on march 16, 2021, mcccd's third-party monitoring vendor detected suspicious activity on a system within the network. to protect our systems and data, we immediately implemented our incident response protocols and took all systems offline. we hired a team of experts to investigate the suspicious activity and guide us through the containment and restoration process.

the forensic investigation determined that mcccd likely identified and prevented a potential ransomware attack. the investigation also identified an attempt to download a maricopa directory file containing the names, dates of birth, email addresses, and hashed passwords for maricopa user accounts. the passwords within the file are hashed, which means the passwords were unreadable without a key to decrypt or break the hash value. however, if you used a commonly known password, it may be possible for an attacker to crack the hash and identify your password. the forensic investigation found no evidence the maricopa directory file left our system, but out of an abundance of caution, we did not permit mcccd users to access applications unless they changed their password.

what information was impacted?

it's important to note that the student information and human resources management systems were not hosted within the mcccd network and were completely unaffected by this incident. we are confident that no student or employee information from these systems, such as social security numbers, educational information, or financial data, was compromised as a result of this incident.

what we are doing and what you can do:

to increase protections against future incidents, we have accelerated the implementation of new security measures to layer on to the security protocols we had in place prior to march 16th. they include:

- supplemental 24x7 endpoint detection and threat hunting software
- additional deployments of multi-factor authentication for all mcccd employees
- forced password reset to all mcccd users, including staff and students.

if you have already logged on and completed a password reset, then you do not need to do it again.

going forward, we ask that you follow these guidelines relating to usernames/passwords:

- while on the network, do not ask websites or accounts that you visit to remember your password(s).
- you should avoid using your school email address/password combination for any accounts that are not school-related, and do not use your school password for other accounts.
- if you did, we recommend changing the passwords to those accounts.
- do not re-use the same password for more than one website or account.

included in this email are tips for creating strong and complex passwords, and details on steps that can be taken to further protect your information.

if you have any questions or concerns, please contact the mcccd customer care center through live chat with extended availability or you may call 1-877-310-1915 and choose option #5 monday through friday from 12 p.m. - 7 p.m. (pacific standard time).

you will receive alerts when there are changes to your credit data at any of the three national credit bureaus, for instance, when a new line of credit is applied for in your name. if you do not recognize the activity, you will have the option to call a kroll fraud specialist, who will be able to help you determine if it is an indicator of identity theft.

fraud consultation

you have unlimited access to consultation with a kroll fraud specialist. support includes showing you the most effective ways to protect your identity, explaining your rights and protections under the law, assistance with fraud alerts, and interpreting how personal information is accessed and used, including investigating suspicious activity that could be tied to an identity theft event.

identity theft restoration

if you become a victim of identity theft, an experienced kroll licensed investigator will work on your behalf to resolve related issues. you will have access to a dedicated investigator who understands your issues and can do most of the work for you. your investigator will be able to dig deep to uncover the scope of the identity theft, and then work to resolve it.

kroll's activation website is only compatible with the current version or one version earlier of chrome, firefox, safari, and edge. to receive credit services, you must be over the age of 18 and have established credit in the u.s., have a social security number in your name, and have a u.s. residential address associated with your credit file.

additional steps you can take

we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

equifax, po box 740241, atlanta, ga 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
experian, po box 2002, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
transunion, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	the university's computer systems were accessed by an unauthorized person who took some files out of their network. the incident was investigated by a cybersecurity firm and law enforcement was contacted.

to whom it may concern,

we are writing on behalf of our client volkswagen group of america, inc., including its operating divisions, audi of america and volkswagen of america (together “vwgoa”) regarding a security incident that affects residents of your state.

on march 10, 2021, vwgoa was alerted that an unauthorized third party may have obtained certain customer information. vwgoa immediately commenced an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this event. vwgoa also contacted federal law enforcement and retained outside data analytics and cybersecurity consultants. the investigation confirmed in early may 2021 that a third party obtained limited personal information received from or about united states and canadian customers and interested buyers from a vendor used by audi, volkswagen, and some authorized dealers. this included information gathered for sales and marketing purposes from 2014 to 2019. vwgoa believes the data was obtained when the vendor left electronic data unsecured at some point between august 2019 and may 2021, when vwgoa identified the source of the incident. vwgoa discovered the information at issue included more sensitive personal information on or about may 24, 2021. vwgoa completed the analysis to identify which specific individuals were impacted on or about june 7, 2021.

this incident involves over 3.3 million individuals. for over 97% of the individuals, the exposed information consists solely of contact and vehicle information relating to audi customers and interested buyers, including some or all of the following contact information: first and last name, personal or business mailing address, email address, or phone number. in some instances, the data also includes information about a vehicle purchased, leased, or inquired about, such as the vehicle identification number (vin), make, model, year, color, and trim packages.

for approximately 90,000 audi customers or interested buyers, the data also includes more sensitive information relating to eligibility for a purchase, loan, or lease. nearly all of the more sensitive data (over 95%) consists of driver’s license numbers. a very small number of records include data such as dates of birth, social security or social insurance numbers, account or loan numbers, and tax identification numbers. vwgoa has retained idx to offer free credit protection services to these approximately 90,000 individuals, which includes the following services for individuals who choose to enroll: twenty-four (24) months of triple bureau credit monitoring services, $1 million of insurance, and assistance in the event of identity theft.

based on vwgoa’s investigation to date, the number of individuals impacted in your state is:
number of individuals with only contact and vehicle information impacted: 9,807
number of individuals with more sensitive personal information impacted: 146

please note, vwgoa is verifying addresses against the national change of address database so these numbers may change slightly.

vwgoa will begin notifying affected individuals on june 11, 2021, regardless of the sensitivity of the data, and will include reminders to remain alert for suspicious emails or other communications. individuals will receive one of the two sample letters attached from either audi of america or volkswagen of america. vwgoa will direct one letter toward individuals whose contact and vehicle information was impacted, and the other toward individuals whose more sensitive information was also impacted. vwgoa is also notifying the three major credit reporting agencies.

protecting the security of personal information is of the utmost importance to vwgoa and vwgoa sincerely regrets any inconvenience this incident has caused. vwgoa is conducting a full security review with the vendor to identify if further security enhancements are reasonable and appropriate.

if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at +1 202.457.6407 or elliot.golding@squirepb.com.

consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

as an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. the credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);
2. social security number;
3. date of birth;
4. addresses for the prior two to five years;

what happened
blackbaud is a cloud computing provider that is used by archbishop mitty high school and many other educational institutions to organize and store information related to members of our community. in particular, archbishop mitty high school utilized blackbaud's financial edge platform for student billing purposes. certain historical student data stored on the financial edge platform included students' social security numbers. at the time, blackbaud assured archbishop mitty high school that all social security numbers and dates of birth stored in financial edge were encrypted. however, in september 2020, blackbaud advised archbishop mitty high school for the first time that social security numbers, and in some instances, dates of birth, were not in fact encrypted for certain legacy versions of financial edge, and that this information was compromised as a result of a cyber-attack on blackbaud. in response to the september 2020 notice from blackbaud, archbishop mitty high school opened a thorough internal review of the records maintained by our institution via blackbaud and worked extensively with blackbaud to determine the scope of this incident and its impact on archbishop mitty high school's student and alumni records.

what information was involved
in late september 2020, blackbaud advised archbishop mitty high school that backup files containing personal information of certain former students were exposed to an unauthorized individual(s) following a cyber-attack on blackbaud. specifically, these files contained personal information, including your social security number. these files may have also included other personal information such as your date of birth, mailing address, and telephone number.

according to blackbaud, and as far as we know, there is no indication that any of the exposed information has been subject to misuse or to further dissemination. blackbaud has also assured us that they have implemented several changes to protect your data from any subsequent incidents. again, while we have no evidence that any information related to members of archbishop mitty high school's community has been or will be misused, we still encourage you to remain vigilant and immediately report any suspicious activity or suspected misuse of your personal information.

what we are doing
archbishop mitty high school takes the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. ensuring the safety of your data is of the utmost importance to us, and we sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern that this may cause. in light of this incident, we are providing you with access to single bureau credit monitoring services at no charge for twenty-four months (please find instructions below). further, we continue to monitor the situation and be in close contact with blackbaud, and we will be sure to keep you apprised of any additional information as it becomes available.

irs strongly advises obtaining an identity protections pin

the identity protections (ip) pin is a 6-digit number assigned to eligible taxpayers. it helps prevent identity thieves from filing fraudulent tax returns with stolen social security numbers (ssns). an ip pin also helps the irs verify taxpayers' identities and accept their electronic or paper tax returns for processing. the irs issues ip pins to confirmed identity theft victims once their cases are resolved. this process is unchanged. what is new is that any taxpayers who want an ip pin, even if they are not victims of identity theft, may now obtain one as well.

here's what you need to know before applying for your ip pin:

this is a voluntary program.
you must pass a rigorous identity verification process to obtain an ip pin. spouses and dependents are also eligible for an ip pin if they can verify their identities.
an ip pin is valid for a calendar year.
you must obtain a new ip pin each filing season, using the online ip pin tool.
the online ip pin tool is unavailable generally mid-november through mid-january each year.
correct ip pins must be entered on electronic and paper tax returns to avoid rejections and delays.

how to get an ip pin:

the fastest, easiest, and preferred way is by using the get an ip pin online tool. here is how it works:

go to irs.gov/ippin, select the get an ip pin tool, verify your identity, and create an account
once you have a username, password, and security code, you can enter the get an ip pin tool
once in, your ip pin will be revealed to you.

unable to pass the online identity proofing?

there are alternatives available, but there will be a delay in obtaining an ip pin. here is how it works:

*services marked with an * require an internet connection and email account and may not be available to minors under the age of 18 years of age. please note that when signing up for monitoring services, you may be asked to verify personal information for your own protection to confirm your identity.

file a form 15227 if you have a valid ssn or itin, an adjusted gross income of $72,000 or less, and access to a telephone. an irs assistor will call you, validate your identity, and ensure that you receive an ip pin the next filing season.

if you are ineligible for form 15227, call the irs to learn about in-person options.

other important information:

you can also obtain more information about identity theft and ways to protect yourself from the federal trade commission (ftc). the ftc has an identity theft hotline: 877-438-4338; tty: 1-866-653-4261. they also provide information online at www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

re: notice of data security incident

dear sir or madam:

our office represents north iowa area community college (niacc) located at 500 college drive, mason city, iowa 50401. pursuant to iowa code chapter 715c and out of an abundance of caution, we are writing to notify your office of an event that may affect the security of information relating to six hundred eighty-seven (687) iowa residents. the investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned after its submission.

nature of the data event

on tuesday, may 18, 2021, an unknown and unauthorized individual impersonated a niacc employee and sent a phishing email to another niacc employee requesting student information. the text of this email is attached as exhibit a. this phishing attack led to the compromise of two documents containing student information and account balances. within 30 minutes after the incident, the niacc employee discovered they were a victim of a phishing attack. the niacc employee immediately reported the incident to niacc administration. niacc administration contacted the school's chief information officer immediately.

within 24 hours, niacc notified all potentially affected students by email about this incident. niacc also notified all faculty and staff with a summary of the incident. niacc administration also reported the incident to the mason city police department and the federal bureau of investigation.

the first compromised document in this data security incident contained the following information for four hundred eighteen (418) iowa individuals and included the following information: name, address, student identification number, social security number, cell phone number, home phone number, and student account balance.

the second compromised document in this data security incident contained the following information for two hundred sixty-nine (269) iowa individuals and included the following information: name, address, student identification number, cell phone number, home phone number, and student account balance.

no other information was contained in both compromised documents.

notice to iowa residents

on june 15, 2021, niacc mailed written notices of this incident to all potentially affected individuals from the two compromised documents, which includes the total of six hundred eighty-seven iowa residents (687). we have enclosed two anonymized versions of the letter. persons whose social security numbers were discovered received a letter in the form of exhibit b and persons whose social security numbers were not discovered received a letter in the form of exhibit c.

other steps taken and to be taken

in addition to alerting students about the incident, niacc has provided students with guidance to help them stay vigilant about protecting their information and incidents of fraud. niacc recommended students review their account statements, monitor free credit reports, and report any suspicious activity or suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the attorney general's office and the federal trade commission (ftc). niacc provided the contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies and informed students of their right to place a security freeze on their credit reports. niacc also recommended that students contact the niacc business office to securely pay their tuition, housing fees, and student fees.

niacc is also offering all potentially affected students with identity theft protection services through id experts. the services include: 12 months of credit and cyberscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. niacc has encouraged affected individuals to enroll and take full advantage of these services.

to help prevent this type of incident in the future, additional cybersecurity training has been required to help all faculty and staff identify and report future phishing emails. niacc is also taking further remedial steps to strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure faculty and staff verify all requests for protected information and that they do not share this information absent appropriate encryption.

contact information

niacc takes the privacy and security of its students' information seriously and is committed to protecting their information. should your office have any questions regarding this notification or other aspects of the data security event, please contact us at (515) 242-2400.

sincerely,

brian mccormac

dear niacc students,

niacc has learned that criminals may contact you demanding immediate payment of tuition and fees owed to niacc. they may try to prove that they are legitimate by providing you with personal identifying information, including student account numbers.

they may impersonate niacc, lenders, or state or federal agencies. you may have already been contacted within the last 24 hours.

only pay tuition, housing fees and student fees through niacc's business office or through trojanhome. do not send money to anyone else purporting to be collecting monies owed to the college who calls, texts, or emails you.

niacc wants to protect its students and is investigating this fraud and will provide you with more information as it becomes available. if you have any questions, please call the niacc business office at 641-422-4214 or email mindy.eastman@niacc.edu.

you are receiving this letter because you are a current or former member of prominence health plan (prominence), and we are providing notice of a recent security incident that may have involved your personal information. while we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, this letter provides you with more information about what happened and what we are doing in response.

what happened?

on april 22, 2021, prominence learned that its data system had been subject to an information security incident during which a third party gained unauthorized access to certain information. prominence immediately took steps to change the credentials used to access its system, secure the impacted environment, conduct an investigation of what happened, and restore the impacted data from backups. the investigation determined that the incident occurred in november 2020. importantly, prominence's membership benefits and services have not been interrupted.

what information was involved?

the data that was accessed included (1) audio recordings of calls made to or from the prominence call center, and (2) electronic image (pdf) files containing certain healthcare provider claim forms, and letters to patients with claim approvals or denials. the audio recordings often included a patient's full name, date of birth and member id number, and the pdf files typically included a patient's name, date of birth, sex, member id number, mailing address, and claim code. the incident did not include members' social security numbers or financial information. given the nature of the accessed data files, however, the personal information is not easy to obtain in a usable format. prominence has conducted online monitoring for any indications of actual or attempted misuse of data accessed and, to date, has not become aware of any such activities.

the incident only impacted information for a portion of prominence plan members. however, in an abundance of caution and commitment to transparency, prominence is providing notice to approximately 45,000 individuals representing all members of the prominence health plan during the 2019-2020 timeframe.

what are we doing to protect your information?

prominence is implementing additional security measures to enhance the continued security of information in its care and reported the incident to the fbi as well as to federal and state regulators.

steps you can take to protect personal information

monitor your accounts

we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. under u.s. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, equifax, experian, and transunion. to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. you may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

as an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. the credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);
2. social security number;
3. date of birth;
4. addresses for the prior two to five years;
5. proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. a legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or id card, etc.); and
7. a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft if you are a victim of identity theft.

should you wish to place a credit freeze, please contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below:

measures that you can take to protect yourself with regard to consumer credit reporting bureaus:

to help protect yourself against identity theft, you may consider placing a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report.

fraud alert: when you place a fraud alert on your credit report, businesses who pull your credit report will see that you may be a victim of identity theft. the company may then choose to verify your identity before they extend credit to anyone who purports to be you. this may make it harder for an identity thief to open more accounts in your name. to place an alert, contact any one of the three main credit reporting bureaus. that company is required to tell the other two bureaus about the alert. when you first place a fraud alert on your account, it will remain for at least 90 days, after which you can renew it. when you do place an alert on your report, be sure that all three major credit reporting companies have your current contact information so they can get in touch with you.

security freeze: a security freeze or credit freeze goes further than an alert and lets you restrict access to your credit report entirely, which in turn makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. this is because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if creditors cannot see your file, they may not extend the credit. a credit freeze does not affect your credit score. a credit freeze also does not prevent you from getting your free annual credit report, keep you from opening a new account, applying for a job, renting an apartment, or buying insurance. but if you are doing any of these, you will need to lift the freeze temporarily, either for a specific time or for a specific party, say, a potential landlord or employer. the cost and lead times to lift a freeze vary, so it is best to check with the	the personal information of royal caribbean group guests was accessed through a data breach incident between february 6, 2021 and february 18, 2021, in which a third party gained unauthorized access to a limited number of employees' email accounts. the personal data that may have been accessed includes customers' names, contact information, date of birth, passport number, state driver's license or other government identification number, and/or tokenized or partial payment card information.

we represent asset marketing services, llc d/b/a govmint.com (ams) located at 14101 southcross drive west, suite #175, burnsville, mn 55337, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to five hundred four (504) iowa residents. this notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. by providing this notice, ams does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of iowa law, the applicability of the iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

nature of the data event

on or about may 3, 2021, govmint.com discovered an unusual code on a platform that was taking customer data off the order entry page when customers were placing web orders on the website. govmint.com immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the event, and to identify any possible misuse, access or theft of data. through our investigation, we determined that the unknown actor gained unauthorized access to portions of www.govmint.com between may 21, 2020 and may 3, 2021. the investigation determined that certain credit cards entered into this website may have been viewed or exfiltrated by the unknown actor.

ams then worked to perform a comprehensive review of all information potentially impacted to determine what personal information was contained in the systems and to whom the information related.

upon completion of their review, ams then conducted a manual review of their records to determine the identities and contact information for potentially impacted individuals. on may 26, 2021, ams holdings confirmed accurate and complete address information for affected individuals to provide notifications. the information that could have been subject to unauthorized access includes individuals name, address, and credit card information.

notice to iowa residents

on or about june 23, 2021, ams began providing written notice of this incident to affected individuals, which includes five hundred four (504) iowa residents. written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon discovering the event, ams moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of ams systems, and notify potentially affected individuals. ams is also working to implement additional safeguards. further, ams is providing access to credit monitoring services for 12 months, through epiq, to individuals whose personal information was potentially affected by this incident, at no cost to these individuals. additionally, ams is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud. ams is also providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, information on protecting against tax fraud, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

what happened?

on september 26, 2020, gallagher detected a ransomware event that affected our internal systems. as a precautionary measure, we took our systems offline, initiated response protocols, launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity and forensic specialists, implemented our business continuity plans to minimize disruption to our customers, and ensured the ongoing security of our systems.

we worked with the cybersecurity and forensic specialists to determine what may have happened and what information may have been affected. our investigation determined that an unknown party accessed or acquired data contained within certain segments of our network between june 3, 2020, and september 26, 2020. while the investigation was able to confirm that certain systems were accessed, it was unable to confirm what information within those systems was actually accessed. therefore, in an abundance of caution, gallagher conducted an extensive review of the entire contents of the impacted systems.

on may 24, 2021, our investigation confirmed that the impacted data included information relating to certain individuals. gallagher continued to work through june 23, 2021, to notify our business partners and to obtain address information for impacted individuals to provide accurate notice to impacted parties.

what information was involved?

although we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information, and have no indication the information is in the possession or control of an unauthorized person or party, we are providing you this notification in an abundance of caution because certain information relating to you was accessed or acquired during this event. the impacted information relating to you includes your <<b2b_text_2(dataelements)>>.

what are we doing?

the privacy and security of employee information are among our highest priorities, and gallagher has strict security measures in place to protect information in our care. upon discovering this incident, we immediately took steps to protect the privacy and security of client, partner, and employee information. we also reviewed existing security policies and implemented additional measures and enhanced security tools to further protect information in our systems. we reported this incident to law enforcement and regulatory authorities, as required by law.

in addition to providing notice of this event to you, we are also providing you access, at no cost, to identity and credit monitoring services for twenty-four (24) months through kroll. information and instructions on how to activate these complimentary services can be found in the steps you can take to help protect your information attached to this letter.

we are writing to inform you about a recent incident that may have involved some of your information. hudson envelope (hudson) takes the confidentiality and security of the information we maintain very seriously.

what happened?
hudson was recently alerted to suspicious activity involving its e-commerce website. upon learning this, hudson promptly launched an investigation. through this investigation, hudson discovered that unauthorized code designed to capture cardholder data was present on the web server that hosts its e-commerce website between june 25, 2020, and january 11, 2021, when the code was discovered and immediately removed.

what information was involved?
while present on the web server, the unauthorized code could have captured cardholder data, including cardholder names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and card security codes (cvv), entered during the checkout process by customers who placed orders on the website. we reviewed order information for customers who placed orders on the website while the unauthorized code was present to identify individuals whose information might have been involved. on may 20, 2021, we discovered that you placed an order on the website while the unauthorized code was present.

what we are doing.
we regret any concern or inconvenience this may cause you. to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, hudson has implemented enhanced logging and additional security features within its e-commerce environment.

what you can do.
we encourage you to review your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. you should immediately report any such charges to your card issuer because payment card network rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges that are timely reported. the phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card.

for more information.
if you have questions, please call 1-855-731-3335, monday-friday, from 9:00 a.m. until 6:30 p.m., eastern time, excluding major u.s. holidays.

additional steps you can take
we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:
equifax, po box 740241, atlanta, ga 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
experian, po box 2002, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
transunion, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:
federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts:
there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes:
you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports?
there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:
experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze?
a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	payment card data was captured by unauthorized code present on the web server that hosts the e-commerce website. cardholder names, billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and card security codes (cvv), entered during the checkout process by customers who placed orders on the website were compromised.

what happened?
on july 31, 2020, our investigation into suspicious email account activity identified unauthorized logins to two facilities staff email accounts between june 22 and june 26, 2020. we immediately took steps to secure the accounts and a computer forensic firm was engaged to assist with our investigation. because the investigation was unable to determine if any emails and/or attachments were actually viewed or acquired, we conducted a comprehensive review of the accounts contents to determine the type of information contained in the accounts and to whom the information related. we then worked with the facilities to confirm contact information for potentially impacted individuals, which was completed on june 2, 2021. during this process, we determined some of your information was contained within the email accounts.

what information was involved?
the information involved may include your name, address, date of birth, medical record and/or patient account number, health insurance information, financial account or payment card information, social security number and/or driver's license number; and/or clinical information, such as diagnosis, treatment information, and/or prescription information.

what we are doing.
we believe that the account access occurred as part of an attempt to divert invoice payments to the wrong place (not to access your information). still, we wanted to notify you of this incident and assure you we take this very seriously. as a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership in experian identityworkssm credit 3b. this product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. identityworkssm is completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more about identity theft prevention and identityworkssm, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership and information about identity protection, please see the additional information provided with this letter.

to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we reinforced education with facilities staff regarding how to identify and avoid suspicious emails and are making additional security enhancements to our email environment.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear impactree community members,

transparency with our community regarding the extent of the security incident impactree experienced on july 1, 2021, is a top priority. please read below for the latest updates.

impactree [july 2, 2021]

notice of data breach

what happened?

we discovered alterations to the impactree platform relating to our action content at 10:30 am pst on july 1. we responded within the hour by shutting down our servers as well as the impactree platform (my.impactree.com) in order to complete a full data and security review. our initial review concluded that the impactree platform was accessed by an unauthorized user.

what information was involved?

the scope of the unauthorized user's activity appears to be limited to alterations of public content hosted on the impactree platform, namely action titles and descriptions. as part of an ongoing, intensive security review, we will be evaluating what personal account information may have been accessed during the intrusion, if any.

at impactree, we take protecting our members' security and privacy very seriously. out of an abundance of caution, we are going to operate as if this information may have been accessed until we can ascertain that it was not.

personal account information stored on the platform consists of platform members' first and last names, email address, country, state, and zip code associated with your impactree account (depending on the information you provided). additional personal data may include the impactree groups that you joined, the actions you completed on the platform, as well as the name and email of the person or organization that referred you to the platform. in a very small number of cases, personal data may also include phone number or street address (if you submitted it).

no personal financial information is stored on the impactree platform. any donations made to nonprofits found through actions on the platform are processed with the nonprofit directly via their respective donation systems. impactree does not keep or store any financial information. impactree does not keep or store social security numbers, driver's license information, identification card numbers, tax identification numbers, passport numbers, or military identification numbers. we have no reason to believe that any of impactree's users or customers' financial or governmental information has been compromised.

what we are doing

an intensive internal security and database review is now underway to ensure that this is indeed the full scope of the unauthorized user's activity. we are working with amazon web services and hired a third-party online security company for a full review of our platform to ensure that impactree is implementing all appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.

what you can do

the impactree platform is live again and ready for you to use. however, we have deleted all existing passwords and are asking everyone to reset their passwords. visit this link to reset your password to regain access to your impactree account:

reset password link: https://my.impactree.com/account/forgot-password

we understand online security incidents can be unsettling, and we deeply apologize for this inconvenience. we look forward to continuing to empower you to take meaningful and measurable actions to make the world a better place -- today and every day. with strengthened security, we are eager to continue growing impact, together.

for more information

if you have any questions, please contact us at support@impactree.com, so we may ease your concerns, or you can call impactree support at (415) 715-9814.	the unauthorized access to the impactree platform was the result of a hacking incident, where an unauthorized user gained access to alter public content hosted on the platform.

re: notice of data incident

dear <<name 1>>:

we are writing to inform you of an incident that we believe affected certain parts of your personal information. the paradies shops, llc and its affiliates (paradies lagardere) operates retail stores and restaurants primarily in airports throughout the united states and canada. in the course of operating our business, we obtained certain personal information about you.

from october 8 to october 13, 2020, we were the victim of a ransomware attack. the attack was not an attack on any system used to process information provided by customers at our stores, but affected only an internal, administrative system. the attacker uploaded these records to third-party servers. we launched an internal investigation and engaged the help of third-party forensic experts. after extensive review of the potentially compromised files, on may 20, 2021, we determined that one or more records contained certain parts of your personal information and required us to send you this notification.

our investigation indicated that your name, as well as your <<breached elements>>, were contained in the file(s). we have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information. however, we are informing you of this incident in an abundance of caution.

we take the security of personal information very seriously. upon discovery of the cyberattack, the company took immediate action to secure our network and systems from further immediate harm. we also retained a third-party cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to confirm that no other company systems were impacted, as well as third-party forensic experts to perform extensive review of the potentially compromised data. furthermore, we promptly reported the incident to federal law enforcement. as we look towards the future, we have taken security measures to strengthen our network against similar incidents in the future.

we also are notifying you so that you may take further steps to protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so. we also are providing you with access to 12 months of credit monitoring and identity protection services through equifax at no charge to you.

please review the enclosed steps you can take to help protect your information for further details, which describes the credit monitoring and identity protection services we are offering and how to activate them. we also encourage you to remain vigilant against the potential for identity theft and fraud and to monitor your credit reports for any potential suspicious activity.

stride inc. (stride) writes to let you know about a data security incident that we discovered that affected some of your information. because the security of information is of utmost importance to us, we are notifying you of the event as well as resources available to you to help protect your information, should you feel it necessary to do so.

what happened?

on or around november 11, 2020, stride was the victim of a ransomware attack. ransomware is a form of attack in which, after gaining access to a system, the attacker encrypts a victim's files and then demands a ransom to restore access to the data. educational institutions, from primary schools through higher education, are increasingly becoming a target of ransomware attacks. as soon as we discovered that our systems had been infected with ransomware, we quickly took steps to lock down impacted systems, notified federal law enforcement authorities, and began working with an industry-leading third-party forensic team to investigate and assist with the incident.

working with third-party forensic investigators, stride determined that an unknown actor may have gained access to stride systems from november 4, 2020 to november 19, 2020. after careful consideration, we also decided to make a payment to the ransomware attacker, as a proactive and preventive step in exchange for assurance that the information obtained by the attacker from our systems would be returned to stride and would not be released on the internet or otherwise disclosed. while there is always a risk that the threat actor will not adhere to negotiated terms, based on guidance we have received about the attack and the threat actor, the company believes the payment was a reasonable measure to take in order to prevent misuse of any information the attacker obtained.

once the incident was contained, stride initiated a comprehensive review, with the assistance of industry-leading forensic specialists, to identify any information of individuals contained in the files affected by the incident. stride also then undertook a comprehensive internal effort to reconcile the results of the third-party review and find contact information for the affected individuals.

[extra4] as soon as stride was aware that information was impacted, including yours, we worked as quickly as possible to notify you.

as you may already be aware, going forward, as part of our ongoing commitment to the security of information we are reviewing and enhancing existing policies and procedures to reduce the likelihood of a similar future event.

what information is involved?

our review determined that the affected data contained your [extra2] and name.

what are we doing?

as mentioned previously, we take this incident and the security of information in our care seriously. importantly, we have no indication that any of the data affected in the incident has been or will be misused. following the payment we made to the attacker, the attacker returned the data they claimed to have obtained from stride's systems. stride subsequently engaged an industry-leading third-party specialist to conduct a search for the data on the internet (including the dark web) and found no evidence of data related to this incident being published, posted for sale, or otherwise disclosed.

what you can do.

as a matter of general practice, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing your account statements and monitoring your free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors. you may also review the information contained in the attached steps you can take to help protect your information. in addition, we are offering you access to complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services for [extra3] months through experian. these services include fraud consultation and identity theft restoration services. if you wish to activate the credit monitoring and identity protection services, you may follow the instructions included in the steps you can take to help protect your information.

re: security breach notification

dear director brauch,

we are writing on behalf of our client, north iowa community action organization (nicao) (located at 218 5th street sw, mason city, iowa 50401), to notify you of a security breach incident involving five-hundred and twelve (512) iowa residents.

nature

on march 31, 2021, we became aware of suspicious activity related to an employee's email account. after discovering the incident, we promptly secured the impacted email account and began taking steps to determine the nature, scope, and extent of the incident. on approximately may 10, 2021, nicao concluded its forensic investigation and determined that an unauthorized individual gained access to five employee email accounts via a phishing email. further, the forensic investigative findings are inconclusive as to whether the personal information was actually obtained.

after concluding the forensic investigation, nicao initially identified 58 iowa residents whose personal information was potentially accessed. on may 26, 2021, nicao provided written notification to these potentially impacted individuals in a substantially similar form as the enclosed letter (attached as exhibit a).

nicao continued performing a comprehensive and detailed review of the potentially impacted email accounts. as a result, on july 1, 2021, nicao concluded its search for potentially affected individuals and located all their recent contact information. finally, as stated above, the forensic investigative findings are inconclusive as to whether the personal information was actually obtained, but as of now, nicao has no evidence indicating misuse of its data or information. however, out of an abundance of caution and due to the impacted email account containing personal information, nicao proactively is providing notice to your office and will provide notice to the potentially affected individuals.

notice and nicao's response to the event

on july 8, 2021, nicao will mail written notifications to the potentially affected iowa residents, in accordance with iowa code 715c.1-2, in a substantially similar form as the enclosed letter (attached as exhibit a). additionally, nicao intends to provide the potentially impacted individuals the following:

- free access to credit monitoring services for at least twelve months (12)
- guidance on ways to protect against identity theft and fraud, including steps to report any suspected activities or events of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank.
- the appropriate contact information for the consumer reporting agencies along with information on how to obtain a free credit report and place a fraud alert and security freeze on their credit file.
- a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports.
- encouragement to contact the federal trade commission and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

finally, nicao is working to improve its cybersecurity policies, procedures, and protocols, implementing any necessary additional safeguards to strengthen its cybersecurity infrastructure and further train its employees on best practices to minimize the likelihood of this type of incident occurring again.

contact information

if you have any questions or wish to discuss this event further, please do not hesitate to call me on my direct dial (410) 832-2002 or email me at spollock@wtplaw.com.

sincerely yours,

contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

- experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
- transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
- equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or	the unauthorized access to guess inc.'s systems and attempt to encrypt their systems, along with the subsequent discovery of unauthorized access to the company's systems for a period of several weeks, indicates that the breach was caused by an outside party, likely a hacker or group of hackers.

notice of data breach

we value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to let you know about a cybersecurity incident involving the ejuice direct e-commerce website that may have allowed an unauthorized third party to acquire a copy of personal information you entered into the website.

what happened?

a malicious script was injected into the website by an unauthorized third party that may have allowed access to personal information you entered into the website between august 15, 2020, and august 25, 2020, and between october 28, 2020, and july 7, 2021. while we cannot definitively confirm that your personal information was affected, it is possible that it might have been as your transaction(s) occurred during the above-referenced period. if it was, this might have exposed you to a risk of fraudulent transactions being carried out using your personal information.

what information was involved?

the data accessed included payment card details (card number, cvc/cvv, and expiration date). other information was not compromised.

what we are doing.

upon discovering the incident, we immediately contracted with a leading cybersecurity firm to conduct a thorough forensic investigation and will notify you if there are further significant developments. we have implemented additional security measures to prevent the reoccurrence of such a breach and to protect the privacy of our customers. the additional security measures include the following:

- the malicious script has been removed from the website;
- multi-factor authentication (mfa) has been enabled for all administrative accounts on the website;
- a web application firewall (waf) has been enabled and configured to provide additional security.

what you can do.

we are notifying you so that you can take action which will assist to minimize or eliminate potential harm. we strongly advise you to take preventive measures to help prevent and detect any misuse of your information.

for more information.

we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this incident has caused you. please be advised that we will keep you informed of any developments in the investigation which may be of importance to you. if you have any questions about the incident, please contact us at 224-220-3222, monday through friday from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. central time or notice@ejuicedirect.com.

ejuice direct recommended steps to help protect your information

1. monitor financial accounts.

as a first step, we recommend that you closely monitor your financial accounts and if you see any unauthorized activity, you should promptly contact your financial institution. we also suggest that you submit a complaint with the federal trade commission by calling 1.877.438.8228 (i.877.idtheft) or online at www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov.

2. review your credit reports.

as a second step, you may want to contact the three u.s. credit reporting agencies (equifax, experian, and transunion) to obtain a free credit report from each by calling 1.877.322.8228 or by logging onto www.annualcreditreport.com. even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the federal trade commission (ftc) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot a problem and address it quickly.

3. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus.

you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

credit bureaus
equifax fraud reporting
1-866-349-5191
p.o. box 105069
atlanta, ga 30348-5069
www.equifax.com

experian fraud reporting
1-888-397-3742
p.o. box 9554
allen, tx 75013

transunion fraud reporting
1-800-680-7289
p.o. box 2000
chester, pa 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year. if you are a victim of identity theft, you have the right to an extended fraud alert which is good for 7-years.

4. place a security freeze.

you have the right to place a security freeze on your credit file free of charge. this will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. in order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name; social security number; date of birth; current and previous addresses; a copy of your state-issued identification card; and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or telephone bill.

5. obtain additional information.

you can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies.

california residents: this notification was not delayed by law enforcement. visit the california office of privacy protection (www.oag.ca.gov/privacy) for additional information on protection against identity theft.

district of columbia residents: you may contact the office of the attorney general for the district	the breach involved the injection of malicious script into the e-commerce website by an unauthorized third party thereby compromising the payment card information of customers who entered personal information into the website between august 15, 2020, and august 25, 2020, and between october 28, 2020, and july 7, 2021.

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam:

we represent arthur j. gallagher & co. (gallagher), located at 2850 golf road, rolling meadows, illinois 60008, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to one thousand one hundred twenty-seven (1,127) iowa residents. the investigation into this matter and notification to the affected gallagher clients and individuals is ongoing. this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission and as the investigation identifies additional iowa residents affected. by providing this notice, gallagher does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of iowa law, the applicability of the iowa data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

nature of the data event

gallagher is a consulting, risk management, claim administration, and insurance brokerage firm that provides related advisory services to its clients. in order to provide these services, gallagher receives information from its clients. on or about september 26, 2020, gallagher detected a ransomware event impacting internal systems. gallagher promptly took systems offline as a precautionary measure, initiated response protocols, launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity and forensic investigators, and implemented business continuity plans to minimize disruption to gallagher clients, and ensure the ongoing security of gallagher systems.

gallagher worked with the cybersecurity and forensic investigators to determine what may have happened and what information may have been affected. gallagher's investigation determined that an unknown individual accessed data contained within certain segments of the gallagher network between june 3, 2020, and september 26, 2020. while the investigation was able to confirm that certain systems were accessed, it was unable to confirm what information within those systems was actually accessed. therefore, in an abundance of caution, gallagher worked with third-party forensic specialists to conduct a programmatic and manual review of the entire contents of the impacted systems to determine the presence of certain information present at the time of this activity and to whom the information relates. on may 24, 2021, gallagher's investigation confirmed that the impacted data included information relating to certain individuals.

gallagher continued to work through june 23, 2021, to confirm the accuracy of the information so it could begin notifications to its business partners and to obtain address information for impacted individuals to provide accurate notice to impacted parties. while the information is not the same for each affected individual, the potentially impacted information includes name, social security number, and/or financial account information.

notice to iowa residents

on or about june 30, 2021, gallagher began providing written notice of this incident to data owners and certain affected individuals in which it has a direct relationship and the threshold requirement to notify your office was not yet met. on or about july 16, 2021, gallagher continued providing written notice to additional affected individuals. while notification to impacted clients and individuals is ongoing, to date gallagher has provided written notice of this incident to approximately one thousand one hundred twenty-seven (1,127) iowa residents. written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as exhibit a. gallagher also posted notice of this incident on its website and issued a press release. a copy of gallagher's website notice is attached here as exhibit b and a copy of the media notice is attached here as exhibit c. this notice may be supplemented if it is determined a significant number of additional iowa residents will receive notice and at the request of clients.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon discovering the event, gallagher worked diligently to investigate and respond to the incident, secure the impacted systems and protect the privacy and security of client, partner, and employee information, determine what personal information was impacted, and to which gallagher clients the information belonged. gallagher is also working to implement additional safeguards and enhanced security tools to the gallagher network, reviewed existing security policies and are providing additional training to employees regarding cybersecurity. while gallagher is not aware of any attempted or actual misuse of the impacted information, gallagher is providing access to credit monitoring services for twenty-four months through kroll to individuals whose personal information was affected by this incident, at no cost to these individuals. additionally, gallagher is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud and encouragement to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports. gallagher is also providing information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud. gallagher also notified law enforcement and is cooperating with their investigation.

1. website and enrollment. go to https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your enrollment code provided at the top of the letter.

2. activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your idx identity protection membership. the monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. note: you must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. if you need assistance, idx will be able to assist you.

3. telephone. contact idx at 1-800-939-4170 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. if you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in idx identity protection, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the idx website and filing a request for help.

if you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our id care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. in the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an id care specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

credit bureaus

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year.

subject: notice of data security incident
date:

dear streetfire user,

we are writing to inform you that we recently discovered that some archived data from the prior streetfire.net website was acquired by an unauthorized party, including some of your information. please review the information below.

what happened?
on june 19, 2021, an unknown actor used what is believed to be a previously unknown technique to gain access to servers storing backup information regarding the prior streetfire.net website. quickly after detecting the attack we took steps to remediate it, but the attacker was able to download certain files before being expelled.

what information was involved?
we promptly retained leading cyber forensics firms to investigate the incident and conduct a thorough analysis of the files taken by the attacker. we learned on july 16, 2021, that the information involved included information about your account and participation on the streetfire site including your [information not specified].

what are we doing?
after remediating the attack, we took steps to understand the nature and scope of the potential unauthorized access and engaged outside cybersecurity experts to investigate. we are working with these experts to assess the need for additional security measures, and we will continue to closely monitor our systems for unauthorized activity.

as an additional measure, we are offering you the option to enroll in one year of identity monitoring services from identity theft guard solutions (idx). these services include cyberscan monitoring. if you would like to activate this coverage, please visit and use the enrollment code below.

idx representatives are available monday through friday from 6 am to 6 pm pacific time. please note the deadline to enroll is october 30, 2021.

enrollment code: [code not specified]

what can happen next and what can you do?
because your information was exposed as a result of the attack, it is possible that unauthorized third parties try to use your information. we therefore recommend that you take extra precautions to protect yourself:

although the streetfire website is no longer active, we recommend that you change your password on any other service on which you use the same password you most recently used on streetfire.net.

you may also receive phishing emails to the email account you used to register your account at streetfire (the email to which we are sending this notice), so you should exercise care when receiving unexpected emails.

this incident did not affect your credit or involve information used to obtain credit. however, we are required by law to provide additional information to you in this letter regarding those issues. this information is provided below.

notice of data breach

dear [name],

we are writing to inform you of a data breach incident involving the open-source tools for instructional support (otis) digital drivers license database, which is a platform used by your school.

what happened?

during a scheduled penetration test in early june 2021, we identified a vulnerability associated with our website https://otis.coe.uky.edu. we fixed the vulnerability and began an investigation with the assistance of a forensic firm. on june 25, 2021, the investigation determined that an unknown party exploited the vulnerability and likely acquired a copy of the otis digital drivers license database between january 8, 2021, and february 6, 2021.

what information was involved?

re: important security notice about your bath & body works account

dear bath & body works customer,

at bath & body works, we care about your privacy and the security of your personal information. that's why we are contacting you today.

what happened?

we recently learned that an unauthorized party gained access to certain personal information in your bath & body works online loyalty account between approximately june 20, 2021, and june 25, 2021. we believe that the unauthorized party capitalized on a breach of another company's system where you may have used the same login information.

what information was involved?

the personal information that could have been accessed by the unauthorized party was the viewable information in your bath & body works online loyalty account including, for example, name, email address, mailing address (if entered), birth day and month (not year), telephone number, loyalty account number and any gift card number and gift card pin linked to your account via the bath & body works loyalty application on your mobile device. if you have elected to save payment-card information through your account, only the last four digits of the payment card saved would have been visible. purchases made in our stores are not impacted.

what we are doing

steps we're taking:

- promptly after learning of the issue, we took steps to secure the accounts and determine the nature of the issue.
- we are coordinating with law enforcement.
- for your protection, we've disabled your current password, and you'll need to make a new one.
- visit the sign-in page on bathandbodyworks.com.
- click on "forgot password."
- enter the email address associated with your account.
- a forgot-password link will be sent to your email address. if you do not immediately receive the link, please check your spam folder.
- follow the instructions to reset your password.

although it does not appear that the unauthorized individual was targeting reward redemptions, to prevent the unauthorized use of rewards, we are only accepting bath & body works reward redemptions when the loyalty account number for an order matches the loyalty account that we have on file.

what you can do

steps you should take:

- please monitor your bath & body works account for suspicious activity.
- promptly change the username and password on all other online accounts for which you use the same or similar username and password.
- validate the availability of any rewards and gift-card amounts that may have been linked to your account.
- call us if you have questions or concerns, including with any gift card linked to your account. if possible, please have proof of purchase information available.

out of an abundance of caution, we have arranged to provide potentially affected shoppers with free identity protection service for one year. you may contact us at 1-(866) 207-6311, 6 a.m. - 2 a.m. eastern, 7 days/week, if you are interested in this option.

for more information

in this mailing, we have included additional steps that you can take to further protect your information.

please know we take the responsibility of protecting the confidentiality of your personal information seriously. we are very sorry that this occurred and are working diligently to maintain your trust.

sincerely,

customer care services reference guide

we encourage affected individuals to take the following steps:

- register for identity protection services. we have arranged to provide potentially affected shoppers with free identity protection service for one year. you may contact us at (866) 207-6311, 6 a.m. - 2 p.m. eastern, 7 days/week, if you are interested in this option.

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	the computer system was infected with ransomware that was identified and contained by the it consultant, and then wiped and restored from backups. since the incident involved an outside party and the use of malware to encrypt the data, it is classified as a hack type of breach.

we regret to inform you that the dixie group, inc. experienced a ransomware incident on april 19, 2021, which caused certain devices in our network to become unavailable. we immediately engaged a cybersecurity firm to investigate and took measures to address the incident and restore operations. we also notified law enforcement and supported their investigation.

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report,	the dixie group, inc. experienced a ransomware incident causing certain devices in their network to become unavailable due to unauthorized access on their network between april 9, 2021, and april 19, 2021, resulting in unauthorized access to folders on their file servers. as a result, sensitive information such as name, social security number, and financial account numbers were obtained.

the missing storage media contained your name and social security number. it is always advisable to remain vigilant for signs of unauthorized activity by reviewing your financial account statements. if you see charges or activity you did not authorize, we suggest that you contact the provider immediately. out of an abundance of caution, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership to experian's identityworks credit 3b. this product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on identification and resolution of identity theft. identityworks credit 3b is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more information on identity theft prevention and identityworks credit 3b, including instructions on how to activate the complimentary membership, please see the additional information provided with this letter.

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.	since the missing storage media contained personal information such as names and social security numbers, it was a physical data breach.

what is being done?

this matter has been reported to federal law enforcement. in addition, cybersecurity professionals have been engaged to investigate what happened and at the same time to further strengthen the security of all systems within the computer network.

what information was available?

an investigation is ongoing to determine which information may have been involved. since it is possible that hm_entity_2's corporate file server containing personal identifying information (including names, birth dates, and social security numbers) may have been accessed, you are being notified through this letter.

identity protection reference guide

1. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by monitoring your credit reports for any activity you do not recognize. under federal law, you are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to order your free annual credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at (877) 322-8228, or complete the annual credit report request form on the u.s. federal trade commission's (ftc) website at www.ftc.gov and mail it to annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga 30348-5281. the three credit bureaus provide free annual credit reports only through the website, toll-free number, or request form. if you see anything in your credit report that you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone number on the report. you should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. if there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in writing.

2. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. you can learn more about fraud alerts by contacting the credit bureaus or by visiting their websites:

equifax fraud reporting
1-800-525-6285
p.o. box 740241

p.o. box 2000
chester, pa 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

it is only necessary to contact one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you should receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review.

3. place security freezes. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personally identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. federal and state laws prohibit charges for placing, temporarily lifting, or removing a security freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. to place a security freeze, you must contact each of the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above and provide the following information: (1) your full name; (2) your social security number; (3) date of birth; (4) the addresses where you have lived over the past two years; (5) proof of current address, such as a utility bill or telephone bill; (6) a copy of a government-issued identification card; and (7) if you are the victim of identity theft, include the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency. if the request to place a security freeze is made by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, the credit bureaus have one business day after receiving your request to place the security freeze on your credit report. if the	the language used in the data breach notification letter suggests that encrypted files were discovered on several systems within the computer network, indicating that the breach involved hacking or malware. the letter also notes that the matter has been reported to federal law enforcement and that cybersecurity professionals have been engaged to investigate the incident and further strengthen security.
insufficient information	there is not enough information available to accurately determine the type of breach.

on july 5, 2021, we discovered that we were the victim of a sophisticated ransomware attack that impacted our networks and servers. ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity's network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity's files, making them inaccessible. the unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity's files.

after discovering the incident, we quickly took steps to secure and safely restore our systems and operations. further, we immediately engaged outside counsel and third-party forensic experts to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident's nature and scope, assist in the remediation efforts, and contacted and filed a report with the fbi. we concluded our initial investigation on august 2, 2021, and determined that an unauthorized individual encrypted some of our systems that contained your information. further, the unauthorized individual acquired some of the information contained on our servers, but we cannot confirm if the information obtained by the unauthorized individual included your information.

however, as of now, we have no evidence indicating misuse of any of your information, but we wanted to notify you of this incident out of an abundance of caution.

what information was involved

the types of information potentially involved are your first and last name, address, date of birth, telephone numbers, social security number, email address, health plan beneficiary number, health insurance information, full-face photos, and/or comparable images, uci (unique identifying number or code generated by us for you), medical information, diagnosis, disability codes, and other certificate/license numbers.

what we are doing

as explained above, we took immediate steps to secure our systems, filed a report with the fbi, and engaged third-party forensic experts to assist in the investigation. further, in response to this incident, we are implementing cybersecurity safeguards, enhancing our employee cybersecurity training, and improving our cybersecurity policies, procedures, and protocols to help minimize the likelihood of this type of incident occurring again.

what you can do

the security and privacy of the information contained within our systems are a top priority for us. therefore, while we have no evidence indicating your information was misused, we strongly recommend you remain vigilant, monitor and review all of your financial and account statements, and report any unusual activity to the institution that issued the record and law enforcement. please see other important information on the following pages for guidance on how to best protect your identity.

we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

equifax, po box 740241, atlanta, ga 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
experian, po box 2002, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

if your health information was involved, we also recommend that you review any statements that you receive relating to your health insurance. if you identify any services that you did not receive, please notify your healthcare provider immediately.

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it	the breach involved unauthorized access to the email accounts of a small number of employees due to hacking by an unauthorized person.

what information was involved?

we cannot confirm if the unauthorized actor(s) viewed or took any specific information relating to you. however, we determined that the potentially at-risk files contained your name, [data elements].

what we are doing.

we took steps to contain the incident, including resetting user passwords promptly upon discovery. as part of our ongoing commitment to the privacy and security of information in our care, we are evaluating opportunities to improve security and to better prevent future events of this kind. we have secured the services of idx to provide you with credit monitoring and identity restoration services for 12 months, at no cost to you.

contents of data breach notification letter: dear [recipient],

we are writing to inform you of a recent security incident that may have involved some of your personal information. safetycall takes the privacy and security of the personal information we maintain very seriously. we provide adverse event reporting services related to consumer products for various companies, including extra2.

the incident occurred at a third-party vendor, netgain, which provides data hosting services to safetycall. netgain informed us that it experienced a network intrusion resulting in unauthorized access to certain portions of its network. netgain first became aware of a potential security incident on november 24, 2020, which ultimately culminated in the launch of ransomware on december 3, 2020. the last day of unauthorized access on its network was december 3, 2020. netgain reported that its environment is secure.

on january 14, 2021, netgain informed us that certain of safetycall's customers' data may have been taken from its network as part of the attack. upon learning of the issue, we immediately obtained the records that may have been compromised and began a comprehensive review with outside data privacy professionals to determine whether any sensitive data was located within them. our investigation concluded on extra3 that the records did contain a limited amount of personal information.

the impacted data sets contained some of your personal information, including your name and any information you provided in relation to the product incident you reported when you called to report an issue with an extra2 product, which may describe a physical injury or adverse reaction.

we have no information to date indicating that your information involved in this incident was or will be used for any unintended purposes. to the extent it is helpful, this letter provides precautionary measures you can take to protect your personal information.

please accept our apologies that this incident occurred. we are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information and have taken many precautions to safeguard it. we continually evaluate and modify our practices and internal controls to enhance the security and privacy of your personal information.

we have no information to date indicating that your information involved in this incident was or will be used for any unintended purposes. as a general matter, however, the following practices can help to protect you from medical identity theft:

- only share your health insurance cards with your health care providers and other family members who are covered under your insurance plan or who help you with your medical care.
- review your explanation of benefits (eob) which is a statement you receive from your health insurance company after you have a medical visit. follow up with your insurance company or care provider's billing office for any items you do not recognize. if necessary, contact the care provider on the eob statement and ask for copies of medical records from the date of the potential access (noted above) to current date at no expense to you.
- ask your insurance company for a current year-to-date report of all services paid for you as a beneficiary. follow up with your insurance company or the care provider for any items you do not recognize.

notice of data breach

dear <<first_name>> <<last_name>>,

we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that affected sac wireless. as a result of this incident, the security of some of your personal information may have been compromised.

what happened

on june 16, 2021, sac wireless became aware that certain aspects of our internal technology infrastructure may have been accessed by an unauthorized third-party as part of a ransomware attack. upon learning of the incident, we promptly deployed multiple security tools and infrastructure enhancements to contain the incident. we then contacted the fbi and engaged external counsel and cyber security experts to better understand the scope of the incident and determine what, if any, personal information was compromised. the forensic investigation was materially completed on august 13, 2021. based on the forensic analysis, we believe that our infrastructure may have been accessed as early as april 13, 2021. the threat actor, conti, gained access to the sac systems, uploaded files to its cloud storage, and then, on june 16, deployed ransomware to encrypt the files on sac systems.

what information was involved

our internal review of potentially impacted personal information is ongoing, but we believe that the files affected by this incident could have possibly contained some or all of the following categories of personal information relating to current and former sac wireless employees: name, date of birth, contact information (such as home address, email, and phone), government id numbers (such as drivers license, passport, or military id), social security number, citizenship status, work information (such as title, salary, and evaluations), medical history, health insurance policy information, license plate numbers, digital signatures, certificates of marriage or birth, tax return information, and dependent/beneficiary names. to the extent that one of your dependents or beneficiaries was included on an sac wireless health plan, their personal information may also have been compromised. while this list of personal information has been identified as part of the data set potentially compromised in this incident, it does not mean that each category of personal information listed was compromised for every individual.

what we are doing

we have been working and will continue to work with our cyber and forensic experts to remedy this incident and to identify potential enhancements to our information security systems. in response to this ransomware attack, we have already changed firewall rules, disconnected vpn connections, activated conditional access geo-location policies to limit non-u.s. access, provided additional employee training, deployed additional network and endpoint monitoring tools, expanded multi-factor authentication, and deployed additional threat-hunting and endpoint detection and response tools. we will deploy additional new measures in the coming months, and we continue to assess and monitor new threats and security vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis.

mater dei high school (mater dei) is writing to inform you of a recent cybersecurity incident that may have resulted in an unauthorized access of some of your sensitive personal information. while we are unaware of any misuse of your personal information at this time, we are providing you with details about the event, steps we are taking in response, and free resources available to help you protect your information.

what happened?

in late january 2021, mater dei became aware of suspicious logins into some of its employees' email accounts likely due to a response to a phishing email message with a malicious link. upon discovery of this incident, mater dei engaged cyber counsel and a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. the forensic investigation confirmed that two of mater dei employees' accounts had unauthorized access from january 1, 2021, to march 4, 2021, where information could have been viewed or exfiltrated. once the unauthorized access was confirmed, mater dei promptly engaged a third-party vendor to review all the files and emails within the compromised email accounts to identify the potentially impacted individuals whose information may have been exposed during the period of unauthorized access. this investigation concluded early june 2021, and it determined that your personal information was within one of the compromised accounts. since then, mater dei has been working internally to identify the addresses for these individuals to send you this notice. at this time, mater dei has no reason to believe your personal information has been misused by any third parties. however, out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to inform you of this incident.

what we are doing

mater dei is committed to ensuring the security of all personal information in our control. as mentioned above, upon discovery of this incident, we engaged cyber counsel and a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. we also changed all email passwords, improved our computer security settings, and new policies were implemented to reduce the storage of sensitive personal information within our email systems. additionally, we are providing you with guidance on how to help protect against the possibility of information misuse. our objective is to always help protect your personal information, and to assist to that end, we are providing you with 12 months of complimentary identity monitoring services through kroll. while we are covering the cost of these services, you will need to complete the activation process by following the instructions included in the enclosed steps you can take to help protect your information.

as a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained.

order your free credit report

to order your free annual credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at (877) 322-8228, or complete the annual credit report request form on the u.s. federal trade commissions (ftc) website at www.ftc.gov and mail it to annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga 30348-5281. the three credit bureaus provide free annual credit reports only through the website, toll-free number or request form. upon receiving your credit report, review it carefully. look for accounts you did not open. look in the inquiries section for names of creditors from whom you have not requested credit. some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names; the credit bureau will be able to tell if this is the case. look in the personal information section for any inaccuracies in information (such as home address and social security number). if you see anything you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the telephone number on the report. errors may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. you should notify the credit bureaus of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. if there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate credit bureau by telephone and in writing. information that cannot be explained should also be reported to your local police or sheriffs office because it may signal criminal activity.

security freezes

you have the right to request a credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit bureau. to place a security freeze on your credit report you must contact the credit reporting agency by phone, mail, or secure electronic means and provide proper identification of your identity. the following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) social security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the registry of motor vehicles. the request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. it is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. below, please find relevant contact information	the breach was caused by an unauthorized party who was able to access and remove data from a file server. a forensic investigation was launched, and a third-party forensics firm assisted with remediation efforts.

what happened?

sequoia financial services provides account receivable services for several agencies. on july 2, 2021, we discovered that we were the target of a ransomware attack. ransomware is a computer virus that encrypts computer systems until and unless money (i.e., the ransom) demanded by the attackers is paid. the attacker gained access on june 28th and launched the attack on july 1st. the attack was blocked by anti-malware software within minutes, and we were able to restore our computers without paying the attackers. these rampant attacks continue to challenge everyone in the business and medical communities.

what information was involved?

we believe it is likely the attacker only wanted money and not the information on our computers, but the encrypted system may have contained some of your personal information. the following personal information may have been compromised: your name, address, date of birth, insurance policy number, and limited health (such as diagnosis codes) and insurance information related to your treatment. if you would like more information about specific information that was identified, you can request that information by calling the number below.

what we are doing.

we take the security of your information seriously and have taken measures to reduce the likelihood of future cyber-attacks, including increasing our hardware and software defenses against these rampant attacks. we are also working with law enforcement and experian, a major credit reporting agency, to address this data security incident.

dear mr.,

notice of data breach

what happened?
we are writing to inform you about a recent privacy incident that was discovered on or around august 12, 2021, at the department of state hospitals coalinga (dsh-c). an employee of dsh-c had been providing patient rosters to the united states district court, eastern district of california (the district court) at the request of the district court. the purpose of this was to determine whether patients were eligible for a waiver of their filing fees when filing a lawsuit. although the roster contained more information than was needed, including information regarding patients who never filed any lawsuits, there is no evidence that the information on the roster was used for any purpose apart from the district court clerk making an eligibility determination for a public benefit provided by the court.

what information was involved?
the dsh-c roster provided to the district court contained your name, case number, birth date, legal commitment, admission date, unit number, and gender. the information did not contain other information, such as your social security number, drivers license number, or financial account numbers which could expose you to identity theft.

what we are doing:
we regret that this incident occurred. after discovering the error, dsh-c took immediate action to limit the exposure of your information by contacting the district court clerk to destroy any and all dsh-c patient rosters that have been provided to the district court by dsh. additionally, any procedures the staff follow regarding patient records will be reviewed and revised to provide dsh staff with further clarity, education, and awareness regarding data protection.

dsh has identified, and is notifying, you, as an individual whose protected health information (phi) was provided to the district court, which is why you are receiving this letter. in addition, dsh-c has reported this breach to the california office of information security, the california highway patrol, the u.s. health and human services/office of civil rights, the california department of public health, the california department of justice, and the california office of health information integrity.

what you can do:
keep a copy of this notice for your records in case of future problems with your medical records. you may also want to request a copy of your medical records from dsh-c, to serve as a baseline by submitting the dsh 6406 form to your treatment team. if you are no longer a patient at dsh-c, you may mail the form to the health information management department, department of state hospitals coalinga, po box 5000, coalinga, ca 93210.

other important information:
enclosed is a copy of breach help consumer tips from the california attorney general for your review.

for more information:
if you have additional questions about this breach, please call (833) 573-2641, or visit [breach notice website]. dsh's website (https://www.dsh.ca.gov/breach_notice_coalinga.html) will have this notice along with a copy of frequently asked questions, which is also enclosed with this notice. you may also e-mail us with questions at dshcshprivacyofficer@dsh.ca.gov. please do not include your social security number or medical information in an e-mail to dsh.

you may also contact your patients rights advocate, jodie keasler, at (559) 934-3861, or the patients rights assistant, garrett stipe, at (559) 476-2027.

for information about your medical privacy rights, you may visit the website of the california department of justice, privacy enforcement and protection at https://oag.ca.gov/privacy.

agency contact:
should you need any further information about this incident, please contact me at (833) 573-2641 or in writing to the attention of the health information management department.

- frequently asked questions	the breach was caused by an employee of dsh-c who provided patient rosters to district court, which contained more information than was needed. however, there is no evidence that the information on the roster was used for any purpose apart from the district court clerk making eligibility determination for a public benefit provided by the court. the information disclosed did not contain other information, such as social security number or drivers license number, but compromising patient rosters should still be considered a data breach.

1. website and enrollment. go to https://app.idx.us/account-creation/protect and follow the instructions for enrollment using your enrollment code provided at the top of the letter.

2. activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your idx identity protection membership. the monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. note: you must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. if you need assistance, idx will be able to assist you.

3. telephone. contact idx at 1-833-992-4006 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. if you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in idx identity protection, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the idx website and filing a request for help. if you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our id care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. in the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an id care specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop, and reverse the damage quickly. you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year.

please note: no one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. security freeze. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. there is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

1. full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., iii, etc.);
2. social security number;
3. date of birth;
4. address for the prior two to five years;
5. proof of current address, such as a current utility or telephone bill;
6. a legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (e.g., state driver's license or identification card); and

re: notice of data breach

metabolic maintenance products, inc. (metabolic) values and respects the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to advise you of a recent incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

what happened?

we were recently notified that an unknown third party may have gained unauthorized access to names and payment card numbers processed through our website. upon discovering the potential incident, we engaged a forensic security firm to conduct an in-depth investigation of the incident to confirm the security of our website and systems. the investigation ultimately determined that an unknown, unauthorized third party installed code on our website that transmitted transaction data to the third party. the sophisticated code was designed to evade detection and required specialized analysis to identify and remove it. the code captured and transmitted transaction information for transactions processed through the metabolic maintenance products and the methylpro websites from approximately may 2020 until july 9, 2021.

what information was involved?

after discovering and removing the code, we compiled a list of all transactions that took place during the relevant timeframe. on august 20, 2021, we determined that your name, address, transaction details, and payment card information for your payment card(s) ending in <<b2b_text_1(lastfourdigits)>> may have been acquired by the third party as a result of the incident.

what we are doing.

upon learning of the incident, we promptly commenced an investigation and hired a leading forensic security firm to confirm the security of our systems and website. upon identifying the unauthorized code, we removed the code from our website and we began identifying potentially affected customers. we are nearing completion of a new, state-of-the-art website to ensure that our customers' data is secure. we have also taken significant steps to secure our existing website, including an updated firewall configuration, increased logging, and traffic detection. we have notified the credit card brands and law enforcement regarding the incident.

what you can do.

if you detect any suspicious activity on your credit card, you should promptly notify your financial institution or credit card company. you can find more information on steps to protect yourself against identity theft or fraud in the enclosed additional important information sheet.

for more information.

for further information and assistance, please call 1-855-551-1490 from 6:00 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. pst, monday through friday, excluding major u.s. holidays.

we value the trust you place in us to protect your privacy and take our responsibility to safeguard your personal information seriously. we apologize for any inconvenience or concern this incident might cause.

4. request a free credit report from each credit bureau after placing a fraud alert on your file. review these credit reports for any accounts and inquiries you do not recognize, as they may be signs of identity theft. if your personal information has been misused, visit the ftc's site at identitytheft.gov to report the identity theft and obtain recovery steps. even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the ftc recommends that you check your credit reports periodically so you can spot problems and address them quickly.

5. you may also want to consider placing a free credit freeze on your file. a credit freeze prevents potential creditors from obtaining your credit report, making it less likely for an identity thief to open new accounts in your name. to place a freeze, contact each of the major credit bureaus using the links or phone numbers above. a freeze will remain in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift or remove it.

6. visit identitytheft.gov/databreach, for additional resources and help to protect yourself from identity theft or call 1-877-438-4338.

on december 15, 2020, we discovered suspicious activity occurring within certain company computer systems. we immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. our investigation revealed that certain forward air systems were accessible in november and early december 2020, and that certain data, which may have included your personal information, was potentially viewed or taken by an unknown actor.

on or about july 30, 2021, we determined that your name, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, or bank account number were potentially viewed and/or taken by an unknown actor. while there is no indication that anyone's information has been subject to actual or attempted misuse, we are notifying you because your information was stored on our systems.

the confidentiality, privacy, and security of information entrusted to us are among our highest priorities, and we take this incident very seriously. as part of our ongoing commitment to information security, we are reviewing our existing policies and procedures regarding data privacy and are evaluating additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of incident in the future. in addition to notifying you, we will also be notifying state regulators, as required.

as a safeguard, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (mytrueidentity) for 12 months provided by transunion interactive, a subsidiary of transunion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.

in late january, golden discovered that certain portions of its network were infected with malware. we promptly took steps to secure the network and, with the assistance of computer forensic specialists, conducted an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the event, including any risk to data. the investigation confirmed that an unauthorized actor gained access to a portion of the network and encrypted network files around january 24, 2021. the investigation also determined the unauthorized actor acquired certain documents before the encryption occurred. given that network locations were accessed without authorization, we undertook a lengthy and time-intensive thorough review of the potentially impacted information in order to identify the information that was potentially impacted and to whom it related. we completed this review on or around august 25, 2021, at which time we confirmed the individuals whose information was present. we then worked to reconcile the results of the review with our internal records in furtherance of identifying the individuals to whom the data related and the appropriate contact information for those individuals in order to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible.

our investigation determined that the information related to you that may have been affected include your <<b2b_text_1(name, data elements)>>. please note, we do not have any evidence of misuse of any information impacted as a result of this incident.

what we are doing.

we take this incident and the security of personal information in our care very seriously. upon discovering the activity, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the event to confirm its nature and scope. further, we have security measures in place to protect the data on our systems and we continue to assess and update security measures and training to our employees to safeguard the privacy and security of information in our care. we also notified law enforcement of this event and will be notifying regulatory authorities, as required by law. we are offering you access to 12 months of identity monitoring services through kroll at no cost to you as an added precaution. if you wish to activate these services, you may follow the instructions included in the attached steps you can take to help protect personal information. we encourage you to activate these services as we are unable to act on your behalf to do so.

re: notice of data security incident

dear [individual],

mtg greatly values the relationship we have with you and understands the importance of protecting your personal information. we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that occurred on our website www.refausa.com. while we have no evidence that any of your personal information was accessed, acquired, or misused, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing you notice as a potentially impacted party and outlining proactive steps to protect important personal information. this letter also describes credit protection services we are providing to you free of charge.

what happened?

after mtg became aware of suspicious activity, we launched a comprehensive investigation, suspended credit card transactions, moved the server offline, and engaged a third-party forensic specialist to determine the nature and scope of the incident. on september 9, 2021, the investigation concluded that the incident occurred between june 25, 2020, and june 15, 2021, potentially exposing certain transactions. mtg reported this security incident to law enforcement.

what information was involved?

according to the forensic firm, the information in this cyber incident concerns payment card information for certain orders placed on our website. the information involved includes the name, address, and credit card information. we want to clarify that we do not store full credit card information beyond the completion of the sales transaction. there was no other personal information involved in this incident.

what we are doing

mtg takes the protection of your personal information very seriously. first, it was important to us to let you know about this matter. second, while we have no evidence indicating that your personal information has been accessed, acquired, or used, to help protect your identity, we are offering a complimentary two-year membership for experian's identityworkssm. this product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. the attachment to this letter provides detailed instructions on how you can activate your membership and start monitoring your personal information.

further, we decided to take a number of other steps to promote security. for example, we implemented enhanced security protocols and suspended all sales activity on our platform to ensure the threat was contained. we have decided to use a new shopping platform to handle credit card processing of orders meeting specific security requirements. the new site will be launched at: www.refausa.com

what you can do

in addition to enrolling in the complimentary two-year membership of experian's identityworkssm, we encourage you to consider these measures to monitor and protect your personal information and to remain vigilant for potential incidents of fraud and identity theft:

vigilance: regularly monitor your financial accounts and, if you see any unfamiliar activity, promptly contact your financial institution. monitor your credit reports, which are available free of charge, as noted below.

free annual credit report: you may obtain a free annual credit report from each of the three national consumer credit reporting companies (experian, equifax, and transunion) by calling (877) 322-8228 or by logging onto www.annualcreditreport.com. for more information about obtaining your free credit report, visit the federal trade commission (ftc) site at: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/free-credit-reports.

fraud alert: you may place a fraud alert on your credit file to ask creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. a request for an initial alert or an extended alert can be made from any of the three national consumer credit reporting companies and can help detect any possible misuse of your personal information. note that a fraud alert may protect you but also may cause delay when you seek to obtain credit. the initial fraud alert is active for 90 days and can be extended. for more information about fraud alerts and security or credit freezes, visit the ftc site at: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-credit-freezes-and-fraud-alerts.

security or credit freeze: you may place a security freeze, also known as a credit freeze, on your credit report free of charge. a freeze prevents an unauthorized person from using your personal identifying information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national consumer credit reporting companies at the toll-free telephone numbers or websites listed below. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze.

contents of data breach notification letter: subject: unauthorized access to your coinbase account

dear [insert customer name],

we are writing to inform you about an unauthorized third party gaining access to your coinbase account and what we are doing to help you manage this.

unfortunately, between march and may 20, 2021, you were a victim of a third-party campaign to gain unauthorized access to the accounts of coinbase customers and move customer funds off the coinbase platform. at least 6,000 coinbase customers had funds removed from their accounts, including you.

in order to access your coinbase account, these third parties first needed prior knowledge of the email address, password, and phone number associated with your coinbase account, as well as access to your personal email inbox. while we are not able to determine conclusively how these third parties gained access to this information, this type of campaign typically involves phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques to trick a victim into unknowingly disclosing login credentials to a bad actor. we have not found any evidence that these third parties obtained this information from coinbase itself.

even with the information described above, additional authentication is required in order to access your coinbase account. however, in this incident, for customers who use sms texts for two-factor authentication, the third party took advantage of a flaw in coinbase's sms account recovery process in order to receive an sms two-factor authentication token and gain access to your account.

as soon as coinbase learned of this issue, we updated our sms account recovery protocols to prevent any further bypassing of that authentication process.

we will be depositing funds into your account equal to the value of the currency improperly removed from your account at the time of the incident. some customers have already been reimbursed -- we will ensure all customers affected receive the full value of what you lost. you should see this reflected in your account no later than today.

we are setting up a dedicated phone support line for our customers who have been impacted by this at 1 (844) 613-1499. these representatives are aware of this incident and can answer additional questions you may have. this phone support line is available for questions and support related to this incident only -- other general inquiries should be directed to https://help.coinbase.com/en/contact-us.

we will be providing free credit monitoring to affected customers who are interested and if available in your country of residence. we will be sharing information about how to obtain that service in a separate communication shortly.

coinbase has also been working closely with law enforcement to support its investigation into the individuals behind this incident. coinbase's internal investigation into this incident is ongoing.

the third party who accessed your coinbase account would have been able to view the following information, depending on what information you have in your account: your full name, email address, home address, date of birth, ip addresses for account activity, transaction history, account holdings, and balance.

we strongly encourage our customers who currently use sms-based two-factor authentication to use an even stronger method of securing their coinbase accounts, such as time-based one-time password (totp) or a hardware security key.

we also strongly encourage you to change the password on your coinbase account to a new, strong and unique password that you do not use on any other site. because the third parties needed access to your personal email account as part of this incident, we strongly encourage you to change your password in the same way for your email account and for any other online accounts where you use a similar password.

we encourage you to monitor your personal accounts and free credit reports for any suspicious activity, consistent with best practices for the next 12-24 months. incidents of suspected identity theft can and should be reported to law enforcement and government agencies, including the federal trade commission (ftc).

we recognize that the trust you place in coinbase is precious and we will continuously work to uphold the highest standards to maintain that trust. please be assured that we will continue to aggressively pursue bad actors and monitor our products to ensure the highest standards of security are met. if you need additional assistance with your account, please don't hesitate to reply to this support case.

sincerely,
the coinbase team	the unauthorized third party gained access to customers' coinbase accounts using phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques and moved customer funds off the platform, taking advantage of a flaw in coinbase's sms account recovery process to bypass two-factor authentication. at least 6,000 customers had funds removed from their accounts, and the intruder was able to view sensitive information such as names, email addresses, home addresses, transaction history, account holdings, and balance. coinbase reimbursed all affected customers and provided free credit monitoring and support through a phone line. the case is still under investigation.
insufficient information	there is no information available about the type of breach that occurred at humana incorporated, and the given description of "nan" does not provide any further insights. therefore, it is impossible to accurately determine the type of breach.
insufficient information	insufficient information provided to properly classify the breach.

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two kinds of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report – an initial alert and an extended alert. you may want to consider placing either or both fraud alerts on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft and provide the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert is also free and will stay on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three credit reporting agencies identified above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com. military members may also place an active duty military fraud alert on their credit reports while deployed. an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment.

credit or security freezes: under u.s. law, you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, for up to one year at no cost. the freeze will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. for information and instructions on how to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies identified above. in order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement or insurance statement. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place as you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze from my credit reports? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or via phone, a credit bureau must lift the credit freeze within an hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after receiving your request.

you can obtain an identity protection pin (ip pin) from the irs that prevents someone else from filing a tax return using your social security number. the ip pin is known only to you and the irs and helps the irs verify your identity when you file your electronic or paper tax return. you can learn more and obtain your ip pin here: https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin.

re: possible disclosure of personal information
[month day, year]

dear [individual name]:

we value your business and respect the privacy of your information which is why we are writing to advise you of a recent incident that may involve the compromise of your personal data. protecting account data and the personal information of our customers is a responsibility that we take seriously. during august 2021 customer envelopes were mailed to individuals for purposes of verifying the information that had been provided to us in connection with an existing account or application for credit. we have determined that an envelope containing your personal information, including your name, social security number, address, and date of birth, may have been erroneously sent to a different individual. please know that as soon as we learned of the incident, we immediately began working to investigate the matter. enhanced quality control has been put in place to ensure this will no longer occur.

while we currently have no indication that your information has been used in an inappropriate or unauthorized manner, synchrony bank would nonetheless like to offer you a one-year subscription to a credit report monitoring service paid for by the bank. if you would like to receive the credit report monitoring service or have any questions, contact us at 855-945-3565, monday through friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. est within 90 days of the date of this letter.

further, we recommend taking the following action immediately:

1. place a fraud alert on your credit files: we strongly recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit files. the fraud alert is free and will require potential creditors to verify your identity before issuing credit in your name, thereby reducing or hopefully eliminating the likelihood of the creation of an unauthorized account. a call to any one of the three credit reporting agencies listed below will place a fraud alert on your credit file with all three agencies. you don't need to call all three agencies. you will receive letters from the agencies confirming the fraud alert and informing you about how to get a free copy of your credit report. the fraud alert is renewable every 90 days.

2. carefully review your credit report: once you obtain your free credit report examine it carefully, looking for accounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate, or personal information that is not accurate. if you notice any of these things or have any questions, promptly call the credit reporting agency that provided the report. if you do find suspicious activity on your credit reports, also call your local police or sheriff's office to file a report of identity theft. make sure to ask for a copy of the police report as you may need to provide copies to creditors to clear up your records. even if you do not find any signs of fraud on your reports, we recommend that you check your credit reports periodically.

3. you may add a security freeze on your credit file: a security freeze will prevent new credit accounts from being opened in your name without the use of a personal identification number (pin) that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency identified above. there may be a fee to place, lift, or remove a security freeze.

for more information on identity theft, we suggest that you visit the federal trade commission's website at www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

again, we sincerely regret this incident and want to assure you we do treat the security of the information entrusted to us with the utmost importance.

re: notice of data breach affecting reprosource

dear attorney general miller,

i write on behalf of reprosource fertility diagnostics, inc. (reprosource or company) regarding a security incident. on august 8, 2021, an unauthorized party accessed the reprosource network. the company discovered ransomware on the morning of august 10, and in less than an hour severed all network connection activity and contained the incident. reprosource immediately launched a comprehensive investigation to determine the cause and scope of the incident, retained leading cybersecurity experts to assist with its investigation, confirmed containment of the ransomware, and quickly and securely recovered operations. additionally, the company promptly notified law enforcement.

while the company's investigation did not confirm that the unauthorized party acquired data in the incident, out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying individuals whose personal information may have been accessed. reprosource undertook an extensive analysis of its files to determine which individuals and data may have been affected, and on september 24, 2021, the company began identifying individuals potentially affected. although our data analysis is ongoing, in the interest of initiating notifications, we are in the process of informing individuals whose personal information may have been affected and offering them a one-year free subscription to kroll's identity monitoring services.

based on its investigation to date, reprosource has determined that personal information in files that may have been accessed or acquired without authorization included: names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, billing and health information, such as cpt codes, diagnosis codes, test requisitions and results, test reports and/or medical history information, health insurance or group plan identification names and numbers, and other information provided by individuals or by treating physicians. for a small group of individuals, personal information may have included drivers license numbers, passport numbers, social security numbers, financial account numbers, and credit card numbers.

we began mailing notifications on october 8, 2021. because our data analysis remains ongoing, we have not yet been able to determine the final number of iowa residents impacted. to date, we have identified approximately 74 iowa residents who may have been impacted by the incident. as our analysis progresses, we will keep your office informed if we identify additional iowa residents.

reprosource has enhanced its cybersecurity by adding additional monitoring and detection tools as safeguards against ransomware and other cyber threats. unaddressed copies of the letters are attached. reprosource has also established a call center to answer patients' questions ((855) 732-0717).

reprosource remains committed to protecting its patients' personal information and assisting those who may have been affected by this incident. reprosource is providing notices to individuals pursuant to 45 cfr 164.400-414 and applicable state laws. by virtue of this notice, the company does not waive any rights and reserves all rights under such laws.

please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this letter.

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security	the unauthorized access to certain devices in timios' network and the encryption of some systems indicate that this is a hacking incident.

petroquest energy llc is writing to inform you of a recent cybersecurity incident that may have involved some of your personal information. on april 9, 2021, petroquest discovered unauthorized access to its systems that may have resulted in access to your personally identifiable information (pii). after learning about the potential unauthorized access, petroquest engaged a forensic team to review the impacted system in order to learn more about the scope and extent of the incident, and whether pii may have been exposed. the forensic investigation confirmed that an unauthorized individual had access to our systems between march 13, 2021 and april 9, 2021.

the forensic investigation determined that some files on our systems may have been accessed by the unauthorized individual. the investigation was not able to definitively conclude what information stored on our systems, if any, was in fact accessed by the bad actor. however, the investigation did reveal that the bad actor may have had access to petroquest's quorum database which contains landowner and lease agreements. notably, much of the information contained in the lease agreements are public record. however, certain older files containing lease agreements and lease packets may have included individuals w-9s with their taxpayer id or social security number. while there is no evidence that the bad actor actually accessed, copied, archived, exfiltrated, or misused imaged files contained in this database, petroquest is nonetheless notifying individuals of this incident out of an abundance of caution. given the size and age of the database, petroquest had to manually review its records dating back many years to identify potentially affected individuals. this exercise was completed by petroquest on september 23, 2021.

petroquest takes the security of your personal information very seriously, and has taken steps to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. in order to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we are offering you access to credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 12 months at no cost to you, through equifax. you may find information on how to enroll in these services in the enclosed steps you can take to help protect personal information.

what we are doing.
to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, newbridge has increased several of its security measures, including but not limited to removing legacy authentication methods, increasing audit logging on all systems, applying hardening policies for greater encryption on system communication, increasing the sensitivity of endpoint protection, strengthening password policies to require greater complexity, implementing multifactor authentication for both internal and remote network access, and strengthening email security efforts for identifying phishing or malicious content as well as internal training for our users to identify these types of cyberattacks.

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

- experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
- transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
- equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348	the breach was due to an unauthorized actor exploiting a configuration error in the microsoft power apps portal.

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

we are reaching out to you again in regards to the security incident that may have compromised the payment card you used in march 2021 for a transaction or attempted transaction at www.scufgaming.com. we have completed our investigation and wanted to inform you of the situation. please note that this communication does not mean that fraud did or will occur on your payment card account. however, we advise you to monitor your account and notify your card provider of any unusual or suspicious activity. as a precaution, you may wish to request a new payment card number from your provider.

what happened?
on february 3, 2021, login credentials for a third-party vendor were used to insert an unauthorized script onto the backend system of scuf gaming's webstore. the unauthorized script was detected on march 16, 2021, and removed immediately on that same day. we conducted a rigorous investigation in partnership with third-party forensic specialists to identify what the script could do and determined on april 21, 2021, that the script was capable of capturing credit card information. we then worked to determine the window of time where credit card information could have potentially been exposed which concluded on july 21, 2021. the investigation confirmed there was a chance the unauthorized script present on our site may have exposed some of your personal information at the point of sale. we are unable to confirm if any credit card transactions during this time period were affected.

what information was involved?
our investigation has determined that orders processed via paypal were not compromised, and that the incident was limited to payments or attempted payments via credit card between february 3rd and march 16th. the potentially exposed data was limited to cardholder name, email address, billing address, credit card number, expiration date, and cvv.

what we are doing
as part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity on our website and continuously improve our security protocols. we will continue to enhance our security features to defend against security threats. in addition, we are also increasing the scrutiny of our third-party vendors and continuing to work with third-party forensics experts to prevent future incidents.

under u.s. law, a consumer is entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus, equifax, experian, and transunion. to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. you may also directly contact the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below to request a free copy of your credit report.

consumers have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on a credit file at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the three major credit reporting bureaus listed below.

as an alternative to a fraud alert, consumers have the right to place a credit freeze on a credit report, which will prohibit a credit bureau from releasing information in the credit report without the consumer's express authorization. the credit freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a credit freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a credit freeze on your credit report. to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.);
2. social security number;
3. date of birth;
4. addresses for the prior two to five years;

credit (security) freeze

a credit or security freeze is when you ask a credit reporting company to block others from looking at your credit report. this can makes it harder for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name.

dear [insert name],

re: notice of a data security incident (please read this letter in its entirety)

i am writing to inform you that an unauthorized third-party accessed my office computer that contained your personal information. with the assistance of professional security experts, we are taking all necessary steps to limit the potential adverse consequences of this security incident.

as a precautionary measure, i would like to offer you one year of complimentary credit and fraud monitoring services, as well as identity theft insurance at no cost. enrollment instructions are provided with this letter.

what happened
on or around july 8, 2021, an email purporting to come from a potential client was sent to my office. the email contained malware, which gave access to unknown individual(s) to my office computer. this computer contained your personal information. this breach was discovered in late july of 2021 and was immediately remediated by removing all malware and changing account passwords. a thorough investigation was then conducted. based on the review of the situation and an examination of the affected data, it is possible that some personal data belonging to you was potentially exposed to the unauthorized intruder. i am therefore taking appropriate precautionary measures to ensure your financial security and help alleviate concerns you may have.

what information was involved
the affected data included personal information, including but not limited to names, associated contact information, and social security numbers.

what we are doing
i have made immediate enhancements to my systems, security, and practices. additionally, i have engaged appropriate experts to assist in conducting a full review of my security practices and systems to ensure that appropriate security protocols are in place going forward. i am committed to helping those people who may have been impacted by this unfortunate situation.

in addition, we are providing you with access to the following services:

- triple bureau credit monitoring/triple bureau credit report/triple bureau credit score/cyber monitoring* services at no charge. these services provide you with alerts for twelve months from the date of enrollment when changes occur to any of one of your experian, equifax, or transunion credit files. this notification is sent to you the same day that the change or update takes place with the bureau. the cyber monitoring will review the dark web and alert you if your personally identifiable information is found online. to enroll in credit monitoring* services at no charge, please log on to https://www.myidmanager.com and follow the instructions provided. when prompted please provide the following unique code to receive services: [insert code here]. in order for you to receive the monitoring services described above, you must enroll within 90 days from the date of this letter.

- proactive fraud assistance to help with any questions that you might have.

representatives are available for 90 days from the date of this letter, to assist you with questions regarding this incident, between the hours of 8:00 am to 5:00 pm eastern time, monday through friday. please call the help line 1-800-405-6108 and supply the fraud specialist with your unique code listed below. to extend these services, enrollment in the monitoring services described below is required.

what you can do
you are encouraged to remain vigilant against fraud and identity theft, including over the next twelve to twenty-four months, by regularly reviewing your financial account statements and monitoring credit reports for suspicious activity, and to immediately report any unauthorized charges to the card issuer. the phone number to call is usually on the back of the credit or debit card. any incidents of suspected identity theft may be reported to financial institutions and law enforcement, including the federal trade commission.

under u.s. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call, toll-free, 1-877-322-8228. you may also contact the three major credit bureaus directly to request a free copy of your credit report at the numbers and websites identified below. you also have the right to place a "security freeze" on your credit report at no cost or charge, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. the security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who may access the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or to lift a security freeze on your credit report.

should you wish to place a fraud alert on your file, you have the right to do so at no cost. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting seven years. should you wish to place a fraud alert, please contact any one of the agencies.

a fraud alert is a temporary (90 day) alert that can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name. this alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you, but may delay you from getting credit. you may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three national credit reporting companies. when that bureau processes your fraud alert, it will tell the other two bureaus to place a fraud alert in your file.

credit (security) freeze

a credit or security freeze is when you ask a credit reporting company to block others from looking at your credit report. this can make it harder for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name.

to place a security freeze with one or more of the three national credit reporting companies, please contact the company and give the information as noted below:

you have been provided with access to the following services from kroll:

triple bureau credit monitoring

you will receive alerts when there are changes to your credit data at any of the three national credit bureaus—for instance, when a new line of credit is applied for in your name. if you do not recognize the activity, you will have the option to call a kroll fraud specialist, who will be able to help you determine if it is an indicator of identity theft.

fraud consultation

you have unlimited access to consultation with a kroll fraud specialist. support includes showing you the most effective ways to protect your identity, explaining your rights and protections under the law, assistance with fraud alerts, and interpreting how personal information is accessed and used, including investigating suspicious activity that could be tied to an identity theft event.

identity theft restoration

if you become a victim of identity theft, an experienced kroll licensed investigator will work on your behalf to resolve related issues. you will have access to a dedicated investigator who understands your issues and can do most of the work for you. your investigator will be able to dig deep to uncover the scope of the identity theft and then work to resolve it.

kroll's activation website is only compatible with the current version or one version earlier of chrome, firefox, safari, and edge. to receive credit services, you must be over the age of 18 and have established credit in the u.s., have a social security number in your name, and have a u.s. residential address associated with your credit file.

additional steps you can take

we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

equifax, po box 740241, atlanta, ga 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111

transunion, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts:

there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been or are about to be a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes:

you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports?

there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze?

a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	the notification explains that an unauthorized party gained access to certain gorilla circuits computer systems between august 18, 2021, and september 15, 2021. the breach was caused by outside hackers.

below, we provide more detailed information for you and respond to questions you may have regarding this matter.

what happened?

goldwater bank believes that it was the subject of what appears to be an attempted ransomware attack on may 21, 2021. on that date, goldwater bank's it vendor received alerts of unusual network activity and was able to quickly respond and stop the unauthorized access in process and prevent further infiltration. goldwater bank reported the event to the federal bureau of investigation and has worked to investigate the event to determine what happened, what data was impacted, and who was responsible. through our investigatory efforts, we identified a location where some of the impacted data was being stored and worked quickly to secure its removal. we have not received any evidence to date that any of the accessed data has been otherwise misused.

what information was involved?

the files that were accessed included customer names and contact information as well as account information. the impacted information may include names, addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, account numbers, and tax identification numbers. at this time, we do not believe the passwords or log-in credentials for financial accounts were compromised.

what we are doing

keeping your information confidential is one of our most important responsibilities. we are notifying you so that we may work together to protect your information. we have taken the following precautions:

- we conducted our own internal investigation to protect and minimize any financial impact to you.
- in addition to notifying individuals whose personal information may have been involved, we have thoroughly evaluated our existing cybersecurity infrastructure and processes.
- while we have a number of safeguards in place to protect information from unauthorized access, we are also always working to strengthen them so we can stay ahead of this type of threat activity.

- please promptly review your credit reports and account statements over the next 12 to 24 months and notify us of any unauthorized transactions or incidents of suspected identity theft related to your accounts with goldwater bank.
- if you ever suspect that you are the victim of identity theft or fraud, you can contact your local police.
- the federal trade commission (ftc) recommends that you place a free fraud alert on your credit file. a fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. contact any one of the three major credit bureaus. as soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. the initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you can renew it after one year.

- ask each credit bureau to send you a free credit report after it places a fraud alert on your file. review your credit reports for accounts and inquiries you don't recognize. these can be signs of identity theft.
- if your personal information has been misused, visit the ftc's site at identitytheft.gov to report the identity theft and get recovery steps. even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the ftc recommends that you check your credit reports periodically so you can spot problems and address them quickly.
- you may also want to consider placing a free credit freeze. a credit freeze means potential creditors cannot get your credit report. that makes it less likely that an identity thief can open new accounts in your name. to place a freeze, contact each of the major credit bureaus at the links or phone numbers above. a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it.
- try to file your taxes early before a scammer can. tax identity theft happens when someone uses your social security number to get a tax refund or a job. respond right away to letters from the irs.
- if you wish to close your existing account and replace it with a new account number, please contact the bank to do so.

dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

maxim healthcare group, including maxim healthcare services and maxim healthcare staffing (collectively maxim healthcare) is writing to inform you of an incident that may affect the security of some of your personal information. this notice provides information about the incident, our response, and resources available to you to help protect your information from possible misuse, should you feel it necessary to do so.

what happened?

on or about december 4, 2020, maxim healthcare became aware of unusual activity related to several employees' email accounts. we immediately began to investigate to better understand the nature and scope of this activity. the preliminary investigation revealed that a limited number of employees' email accounts were accessed without authorization between october 1, 2020, and december 4, 2020. we worked with outside forensic specialists to determine the full scope and impact of this event. unfortunately, the investigation was not able to determine exactly which email messages or attachments may have been accessed or viewed without authorization. in an abundance of caution, a detailed and thorough programmatic and manual review of the contents of the email accounts was performed to determine whether sensitive information was contained in the email messages or attachments at the time of the incident. upon receiving the initial results of the review on august 24, 2021, maxim healthcare worked diligently to locate address information for the affected individuals and completed that effort on september 21, 2021.

what information was involved?

the investigation in this matter was unable to confirm whether information related to you was actually accessed or viewed by an unauthorized actor during this event. however, maxim healthcare is notifying you out of an abundance of caution. the information related to you that was potentially accessible within the impacted email accounts includes your name, address, and other data elements.

re: notice of data privacy matter

dear valued patient,

we are writing to inform you of a recent matter involving your personal information. we take the privacy of personal information seriously, which is why we want to make you aware of this matter and the steps we are taking in response. there is no evidence that anyone has taken or misused your information as a result of this matter, and neither your financial information nor social security number were involved.

what happened?

on october 5, 2021, alcon sent an email to healthcare providers that, due to a technical error, included limited information about patients who recently received an alcon intraocular lens implant. the email, which we sent to facilitate billing, should have only contained information about each healthcare provider's own patients. instead, the communication inadvertently contained limited information about a broader set of patients who received an alcon intraocular lens implant.

we are informing you of this matter because you recently received an alcon intraocular lens implant, and your information was included in the communication sent to healthcare providers.

what information was involved?

the information disclosed to healthcare providers was your first and last name, device serial number, date of implant, and treating physician. the communication did not include any other health or medical information or your financial information or social security number.

what we are doing.

once we discovered that this email disclosure had occurred, we took immediate steps to correct the issue. we notified all of the healthcare providers who received the communication that they should delete the information that was inadvertently sent to them. we also immediately began reviewing our internal processes and procedures to determine the sources of the technical error and correct it.

what you can do.

we do not have reason to believe your personal information will be used inappropriately because of this matter. however, should you have any questions about this matter, please contact us using the information below.

for more information.

alcon is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. we deeply regret any inconvenience or concern this matter may have caused. if you have questions, please contact us at unbilled.implants@alcon.com.

sincerely,

notice of data breach

dear [individual name]:

we value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to let you know about a data security incident that may involve your personal information.

what happened?

on or about september 26, 2020, bad actors injected a piece of malicious code into diode dynamics databases, exploiting a vulnerability in the e-commerce platform used by diode dynamics to process credit card transactions. our investigation indicates that the malicious code was capable of reading information that customers entered in data fields in the payment processing area of our website and transmitting that information to the bad actors. the sophisticated nature of the malicious code allowed it to operate undetected, even though diode dynamics regularly runs security scans of its software using two separate, sophisticated scanning tools. once diode dynamics became aware of this exploit, it moved quickly to have it removed from its website software, and the malicious code was completely removed on october 27, 2021.

this vulnerability did not affect purchases made by our customers using paypal.

what information was involved?

the data accessed may have included personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and credit card numbers, expiration dates and security (cvv) codes.

what we are doing

diode dynamics values your privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. diode dynamics is conducting a thorough review of the potentially affected systems and will notify you if there are any further significant developments. diode dynamics has implemented additional security measures designed to prevent a recurrence of such an attack and to protect the privacy of diode dynamics's valued customers.

diode dynamics also is working closely with major credit card suppliers and law enforcement to ensure the incident is properly addressed.

what you can do

please also review the attachment to this letter (steps you can take to further protect your information) for further information on steps you can take to protect your information, and how to receive free [credit monitoring/identity theft protection] services for one year.

for more information

for further information and assistance, please contact diode dynamics at (314) 205-3033 between 10:00 a.m.- 5:00 p.m. cst daily or visit http://www.diodedynamics.com.

what happened?
the following description is based on astoria's investigation to date: in late january 2021, an alleged security researcher, along with an associate, gained unauthorized access to an astoria system which had a database of individuals' personal information. the two individuals were able to obtain a portion of personal information maintained by the system, although the system prevented attempts to obtain further data. astoria became aware of the intrusion on feb 8, 2021, and took immediate steps to secure its systems and conduct an internal forensic investigation to determine what information was accessed during the intrusion. after many months of work, astoria was able to obtain a copy of the data obtained by the security researcher and compare it with astoria's records. in an abundance of caution, astoria is now notifying all individuals who were identified as potentially having sensitive data obtained during the incident. additional technical details about the cyber attack are currently posted at https://astoriacompany.com/cyberupdate/.

contents of data breach notification letter: subject: notice of security incident affecting your godaddy managed wordpress service

dear [name],

we regret to inform you that a security incident has occurred that affects your godaddy managed wordpress hosting service. on november 17, we detected suspicious activity in our wordpress hosting environment and immediately launched an investigation with the assistance of a third-party it forensics firm. we have also contacted law enforcement. our investigation is ongoing, but we have determined that an unauthorized third party gained access to certain authentication information for administrative services on or about september 6, 2021. specifically, this includes your customer number, email address associated with your account, wordpress admin login set at inception, and your sftp and database usernames and passwords.

this means that the unauthorized party could have accessed your managed wordpress service and made changes to it, including altering your website and the content stored on it. the exposure of your email address may also present a heightened risk of phishing attacks. we are taking several steps to protect you and your data. first, we have blocked the unauthorized third party from our systems. second, we have rotated your wordpress admin login credentials, sftp password, and your database password. your website is still up and running, but you won't be able to edit content until you reset your passwords.

here are the instructions on how to reset each password:

- wordpress admin login: https://www.godaddy.com/help/a-26916
- sftp or data password: https://www.godaddy.com/help/a-40804
- wordpress database password: https://www.godaddy.com/help/a-24573

if you use the same password for other accounts, we recommend that you change your password to those accounts and adopt data security best practices, such as choosing a strong unique password, regularly changing it, and enabling multi-factor authentication where available. we also recommend that you remain vigilant for potentially fraudulent communications sent to your email address purporting to be from godaddy or other third parties.

finally, because the private key of your existing managed wordpress ssl certificate was exposed, the certificate will need to be revoked. we are in the process of installing a free dv ssl certificate on your website for one year to minimize potential site downtime. if you would like to continue using your existing ssl certificate product, please follow the directions below to rekey a new certificate: https://www.godaddy.com/help/rekey-my-certificate-4976.

if you have any other questions or need further assistance, please call 480-505-8870. for residents living in california, colorado, delaware, illinois, new york, new jersey, oregon, vermont, washington, and wyoming, please visit https://www.godaddy.com/help/a-41004 for additional resources that describe additional steps you can take to help protect your information, including recommendations by the federal trade commission regarding identity theft protection and details on how to place a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.

thank you,

re: notice of security incident

dear first name middle name last name,

lincare holdings inc. and its subsidiary companies (collectively, lincare) value and respect the privacy and security of patient personal information, which is why it is notifying you of a recent security incident that may have involved the disclosure of certain personal information. this letter contains information regarding the incident, the measures lincare has taken since the incident, and steps you can take to further protect your information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

what happened?

on september 26, 2021, lincare identified unusual activity on certain systems within its network. lincare took immediate action after learning of the incident to secure its network and launched an investigation, including working with outside cybersecurity experts to determine the source of the activity and potential impact on lincare's network. the investigation confirmed that certain systems may have first been accessed on september 10, 2021. the unauthorized access was blocked by september 29, 2021. a comprehensive review of all potentially impacted data has commenced and remains ongoing. this review includes a manual review of the data to identify any potential personal information.

what information was involved?

the investigation determined that the incident may have resulted in unauthorized access to your personal information including <<data elements>>. we are also not aware of any misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

what we are doing.

we are committed to protecting your information. although we are not aware of any misuse of your information as a result of this incident, out of an abundance of caution, we are offering you complimentary credit monitoring through kroll. these services will be available to you for one year at no cost to you in order to give you peace of mind. this letter contains additional information regarding these services and instructions on how you may enroll. you must complete the enrollment steps listed in this letter.

we take the protection and proper use of personal information very seriously. we took steps to launch an investigation immediately after identifying the incident, enlisted outside cybersecurity experts to assist in the investigation, and notified law enforcement of the incident. we also promptly reset all user passwords to block any unauthorized access and are implementing additional technological safeguards on our systems that contain personal information to minimize the possibility of an incident like this from occurring in the future. this letter also includes additional information and resources to assist you in protecting your personal information, should you feel it appropriate to do so.

what you can do.

we are aware of how important personal information is to patients and their loved ones. we recommend that you activate your complimentary credit monitoring services with kroll. as a best practice, we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review all claims information from your health insurance provider, and to monitor your credit reports and financial statements for suspicious activity. you can also report any suspicious activity to the credit bureaus at the numbers listed below in this letter. we also recommend that you review the information we are enclosing in this letter about steps you can take to help protect your personal information as you deem appropriate.

we will keep this page updated with actions we are taking, including free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for those whose personal information was potentially accessed.

what happened?

on august 6, 2021, dna diagnostics center, inc. (ddc) detected potential unauthorized access to its network, during which there was unauthorized access and acquisition of an archived database that contained personal information collected between 2004 and 2012. the impacted database was associated with a national genetic testing organization system that ddc acquired in 2012. this system has never been used in ddc's operations and has not been active since 2012.

therefore, impacts from this incident are not associated with ddc. however, impacted individuals may have had their information, such as social security number or payment information, impacted as a result.

upon learning of this issue, ddc proactively contained and secured the threat and executed a prompt and thorough investigation in consultation with third-party cybersecurity professionals. ddc has also coordinated closely with law enforcement following the discovery of this incident.

our investigation determined that the unauthorized individual(s) potentially removed certain files and folders from portions of our database between may 24, 2021 and july 28, 2021. ddc has been and remains fully operational, and the systems and databases that are actively used by ddc were not infiltrated.

the in-depth investigation concluded on october 29, 2021, and ddc has begun notifying individuals potentially affected by this incident.

how will you know if you were impacted?

if you know you have received a relationship test from ddc directly, this incident did not affect that test, as the information was acquired from an archived system that was never used by ddc.

individuals whose personal information was potentially accessed are being notified in accordance with state regulations, and out of an abundance of caution to protect against identity fraud, ddc is providing a complimentary membership of experian credit monitoring to eligible individuals.

if you received a relationship test as a part of court proceedings or independent, individual testing between 2004 and 2012 but have not received a mailed letter from ddc regarding this incident, please contact 1-855-604-1656 as you may be eligible for complimentary credit monitoring services through experian.

what is ddc doing?

ddc has taken steps, in coordination with its third-party cybersecurity experts, to regain possession of this personal information and ensure its safekeeping. ddc is not aware of any reports of identity fraud or improper use of the information.

additionally, out of an abundance of caution, we are offering free credit monitoring for impacted individuals to protect against identity fraud. ensuring the safety and security of the personal information entrusted to us remains our primary responsibility, and we will continue to work with third-party experts to harden our cybersecurity defenses.

if you have any further questions regarding this incident, please call our dedicated and confidential toll-free response line that we have set up to respond to questions at 1-855-604-1656. the response line is available monday through friday 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, eastern standard time, excluding u.s. holidays.

steps individuals can take to protect personal information:

1. placing a fraud alert	the unauthorized individual(s) potentially removed certain files and folders from portions of the database between may 24, 2021 and july 28, 2021, demonstrating that this incident was a hack involving an outside party.

re: cybersecurity incident involving sound generations

dear attorney general miller:

wilson elser moskowitz edelman and dicker llp (wilson elser) represents sound generations (sg), a 501c3 non-profit organization that serves older adults and adults with disabilities in king county, washington. sg is washington state's largest provider of comprehensive services for aging adults in king county. sg strives to expand the provision of food security, transportation, health & wellness, and assistance services to underserved and marginalized populations. sg's programs and affiliated service sites provide accessible resources and services across king county.

this letter will serve to inform you of the nature of recent cybersecurity incidents involving sg, what information may have been compromised, the number of iowa residents being notified, and the steps that sg has taken in response to the incident. we have also enclosed hereto a sample of the notification made to the potentially impacted individuals.

please note that the information contained herein is deemed to be confidential, non-public, and privileged. by sharing this information with your office, sg does not intend to waive any such confidentiality or privilege that may attach. sg respectfully requests that your office designate and treat this information as confidential and refrain from sharing this information with any third parties. sg trusts the confidential information contained in this response demonstrates that sg has taken prompt and effective action to address this incident.

1. nature of the incident

on july 18, 2021, sg became aware of a ransomware incident that impacted all of its systems and created a substantial disruption of sg's operations. with the assistance of a specialized cybersecurity firm, sg began working to resume business activities and conducted a forensic investigation to attempt to determine the full nature and scope of this incident. while in the process of investigating, sg experienced another ransomware incident on september 18, 2021, carried out by a different threat actor. in both instances, sg terminated the unauthorized access and promptly commenced an investigation to determine the scope of the incidents. in order to resume business and to mitigate any further issues, sg wiped its systems. the result of doing so was that many digital artifacts were lost and unavailable for analysis. a forensics investigation was conducted.

due to lack of artifacts to analyze, the investigation was inconclusive as to whether the threat groups accessed or exfiltrated any data stored on sg's systems. sg worked to determine what type of data was stored on its systems and who this data belonged to. sg reviewed the records for all of its programs to determine anyone whose sensitive information could have been stored on any of its systems. it was determined that data was stored for sg's clients, employees, vendors, donors, and volunteers. given the significant notice population, sg has worked to obtain names and addresses in order to provide direct written notice for as many potentially impacted individuals as possible. the investigation concluded on november 9, 2021. out of an abundance of caution, sg notified all individuals potentially impacted by the incident.

the type of information potentially impacted varies by the individual's relationship with sg. for each subset of the population, they have received individualized letters to explain what information may have been in scope. for sg clients, the information potentially impacted includes name, address, phone number, email, date of birth, whether or not its clients have health insurance, health insurance number, and for clients who provided the information to sg, health history or condition. for sg employees, the information potentially impacted includes name, phone number, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's license and/or state-issued identification card number, passport number, military identification number, medical information, health insurance information, health insurance policy numbers, digitized or electronic signature, financial aid information, and financial account numbers. for sg volunteers, the information potentially impacted includes name, address, phone number, email, date of birth, and driver's license number. for sg donors, the information potentially impacted includes name, address, phone number, email, date of birth, and donation history. for sg vendors, the information potentially impacted includes name, phone number, address, social security number, or tax identification number. as of this writing, sg has not received any reports of related identity theft since following the above-referenced events.

2. number of iowa residents affected.

sg identified and notified 600,605 individuals potentially affected by this incident. of those, 669 were residents of iowa. notification letters to these individuals were mailed between	insufficient information has been presented about the breach to classify it as any of the breach types listed. the information provided only mentions that sound generations, a non-profit organization that provides services to older adults and adults with disabilities in king county, washington, experienced two ransomware incidents in july and september 2021. an investigation was conducted to determine the scope of the incidents and the type of data stored on its systems, but it was inconclusive due to the lack of artifacts. the investigation concluded on november 9, 2021, and sg notified potentially impacted individuals, including 669 residents of iowa. the type of information potentially impacted varies by the individual's relationship with sg. however, no information was provided on how the data was breached or lost, so a breach type cannot be determined with the available information.

what happened?

we recently completed an investigation that involved unauthorized access to an employee's email account. upon discovery of the incident, we immediately took steps to secure the account and launched an investigation. a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist with the investigation and determined that an unauthorized party was able to access the employee's email account between april 28, 2021, and may 11, 2021. the investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized party. therefore, we conducted a comprehensive review of the contents of the email account to determine the specific individuals whose information was contained within the email and attachments. we analyzed the results and determined that an email or attachment in the account included some of your information.

what information was involved?

the information that may have been accessed includes your name, social security number, driver's license number, financial account information, and/or health information.

what we are doing:

to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we have implemented additional measures to enhance our existing security protocols. as a precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership in experian's identityworkssm credit 3b. this product provides you with identity detection and resolution of identity theft. identityworks credit 3b is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more information on identityworks credit 3b, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided with this letter.

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com

transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com

equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	the unauthorized access to an employee's email account by an outside party constitutes a hacking data breach.
insufficient information	there is no information available on the type of breach, only the name of the organization and a missing description.
insufficient information	there is not enough information provided to determine the type of breach.
insufficient information	insufficient information provided to make a determination about the type of breach.

uphealth, inc.	the breach involved an unauthorized third party accessing personal information and protected health information (phi) by hacking into innovations group, inc.'s (igis) servers. there was a forensic investigation that confirmed the breach started on october 27, 2021, and that igis servers were only secured on october 30, 2021.
contents of data breach notification letter: notice of cyber incident

anderson mcpharlin & conners llp (amc) experienced a cybersecurity incident on june 24, 2021, that may have resulted in the disclosure of certain individuals' personal information. this notice is intended to alert those individuals of the incident and steps they can take to protect themselves.

what happened?

on june 24, 2021, amc experienced a network intrusion that resulted in the encryption of information stored on its computer systems. upon discovery of the incident, amc immediately terminated access to its environment and took steps to secure its systems before bringing them back online.

amc also engaged a specialized cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensics investigation of the incident to determine the nature and scope of the attack and the potential compromise of sensitive information stored on amc's systems. the investigation concluded on august 26, 2021, and determined that an unauthorized party had access to data stored on amc's information systems.

thereafter, amc conducted an internal investigation in an attempt to identify those individuals whose personally identifiable information (pii) may have been compromised as a result of the incident. however, due to the number of affected files potentially containing pii and lack of complete contact information for all individuals, amc is providing substitute notice of the incident pursuant to applicable law.

what information was impacted?

while amc does not have any evidence of misuse of pii, amc is nonetheless notifying individuals of the incident out of an abundance of caution and for purposes of full transparency. based on the investigation, the unauthorized party may have had access to one or more of the following data elements: name, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, financial account information, and/or limited health information. please note that not every data element was present for every individual.

what steps have we taken to protect your information?

following the incident, amc has continued to strengthen its security posture by adding the following security controls: strengthening password complexity requirements; updating intrusion detection and intrusion prevention policies; and updating security awareness and training for our employees.

additionally, we have also obtained complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection for all potentially affected individuals. we encourage you to take advantage of the complimentary credit monitoring services and identity theft protection.

what steps can you take to protect your information?

if you believe that amc may have had your pii in connection with any cases handled by amc in which you were a party, please call 1-800-405-6108 to obtain a code to register for complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. please note that you may be required to provide the case information.

amc encourages individuals to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review account statements, and explanation of benefits forms, and to monitor free credit reports for suspicious activity and to detect errors.

additional steps you can take to protect yourself are outlined below.

credit reports: you may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. to order your free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com, or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228. you can also order your annual free credit report by mailing a completed annual credit report request form (available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) to: annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga, 30348-5281.

fraud alerts: you can place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus by phone and online with equifax (https://assets.equifax.com/assets/personal/fraud_alert_request_form.pdf); transunion (https://www.transunion.com/fraud-alerts); or experian (https://www.experian.com/fraud/center.html). a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. as of september 21, 2018, initial fraud alerts last for one year. victims of identity theft can also get an extended fraud alert for seven years. the phone numbers for all three credit bureaus are at the bottom of this page.

monitoring: you should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.

security freeze: you also have the right to place a security freeze on your credit report. a security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. to place a security freeze on your credit report, you need to make a request to each consumer reporting agency. you may make that request by certified mail, overnight mail, regular stamped mail, or by following the instructions found at the websites listed below.

the following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse or a minor under the age of 16, this information must be provided for him/her as well): (1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes; (2) social security number; (3) date of birth; (4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and (5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the registry of motor vehicles. the request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. it is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue. as of september 21, 2018, it is free to place, lift, or remove a security freeze. you may also place a security freeze for children under the age of 16. you may obtain a free security freeze by contacting any one or more of the following national consumer reporting agencies:

re: notice of data breach

dear <<first name>> <<last name>>,

hoya optical labs of america, inc. provides prescription lenses to eyecare providers, including [yours/name of ecp where instructed]. on behalf of [your eyecare provider/name of ecp where instructed] we are contacting you about a recent ransomware attack that is further described below. this incident compromised the security of your name and prescription information. although we do not believe this information could be misused to commit identity theft or fraud, we are notifying you of this incident and providing you with guidance and services to help you protect yourself against these risks.

what happened

on april 5, 2021, we discovered that files on some of our servers and workstations in the u.s. had been encrypted in an apparent ransomware attack. our team worked diligently to minimize the impact on our servers and operations, and to restore functionality. we reported the incident to law enforcement. we engaged an outside law firm and forensics experts to investigate the scope and impact of the incident, including investigating whether any data was taken by the attackers, and to identify any such data and the affected individuals. our investigation into this incident included a programmatic and manual review of the data.

what information was involved

our investigation recently concluded that the attackers acquired your name and your eyecare provider. in some cases, the data may have also included your eyewear prescription information. in providing services to your employer, we do not collect other personal information such as your social security numbers, drivers license numbers, financial account information, or addresses, and therefore none of this information was compromised in this incident.

what we are doing

although we do not believe that your name, identity of your eyecare provider and/or your eyewear prescription information could be misused for identity theft or fraud, hoya has notified your eyecare provider, and is notifying you of this incident on behalf of your eyecare provider. we are also reviewing and enhancing our system security, governance practices and ongoing monitoring to help prevent a recurrence of an incident like this in the future.

what you can do

we recommend that you remain vigilant and review your account statements and credit reports regularly, and report any concerning transactions to your financial services provider. we also provide the enclosed guidance, which you may use to protect yourself, even though we do not believe this incident exposes you to a risk of identity theft or fraud.

additional steps you can take

we remind you it is always advisable to be vigilant for incidents of fraud or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll free at 1-877-322-8228.

contact information for the three nationwide credit reporting companies is as follows:

equifax, po box 740241, atlanta, ga 30374, www.equifax.com, 1-800-685-1111
experian, po box 2002, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com, 1-888-397-3742
transunion, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com, 1-800-916-8800

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney generals office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report. for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that’s because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can’t see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.

additional information for residents of the following states:

north carolina: you may contact and obtain information from your state attorney general at:

north carolina attorney general’s office, 9001 mail service centre, raleigh, nc 27699, 1-919-716-6000 / 1-877-566-7226, www.ncdoj.gov	the information provided indicates that an unauthorized party gained access to the organization's it systems and removed files containing information pertaining to the hospital's patients. the breach was caused by an outside party and involved hacking.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information.

after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

how do i lift a freeze? a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your	the breach involved suspicious activity involving employee email accounts, and an unauthorized individual accessed the employees' accounts between may 18, 2021 and august 11, 2021. an investigation by a cybersecurity firm was conducted to assist and it was determined on december 8, 2021, that some personal information was contained in the accounts.

january 14, 2022

what happened?

on or about november 16, 2021, one of our employees received an email that appeared to be from a voicemail service. that email was from a criminal, however, and when the employee clicked on the link, he was redirected to a website that purported to store his voicemail. the employee entered their email and password, which the criminals used to access some information, generally related to our internal financial processes. we discovered the intrusion on november 16, 2021. we immediately began an investigation and containment measures, including password resets. during the course of our investigation, we determined that limited client information was in some emails accessed by the criminals. while we have no evidence that the criminals have misused this information, or even were seeking the names of our clients, we have decided to notify you so that you can take the steps to protect yourself, if you so desire.

what information was involved?

the vast majority of records were limited to first name and last name. while in most cases this is not sufficient information to trigger notification, given the sensitive nature of our work, we decided to notify you out of an abundance of caution. some records did include covid vaccination status. no payment card information, social security numbers, or treatment records were implicated.

what we are doing.

when we discovered the intrusion, we took immediate steps to halt the criminals' access. we have no evidence of continued access at this time. in addition, we have retained outside experts to help us understand the full scope of any criminal activity and to validate our containment measures. we have enhanced our security to help prevent this type of incident in the future, although no security is perfect. we are currently developing plans to enhance our security further.

what you can do.

at this time, we have no evidence that any client information implicated by this incident has been used for fraudulent purposes. however, it is always a good idea to review statements that you receive from financial institutions to ensure the accuracy of all charges. in addition, clients may contact their treatment centers to sign up for credit monitoring services or additional information.

security freeze.

security freezes, also known as credit freezes, restrict access to your credit file, making it harder for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. you can freeze and unfreeze your credit file for free. you also can get a free freeze for your children who are under 16. and if you are someone's guardian, conservator, or have a valid power of attorney, you can get a free freeze for that person, too.

how will these freezes work? contact all three of the nationwide credit reporting agencies equifax, experian, and transunion. if you request a freeze online or by phone, the agency must place the freeze within one business day. if you request a lift of the freeze, the agency must lift it within one hour. if you make your request by mail, the agency must place or lift the freeze within three business days after it gets your request. you also can lift the freeze temporarily without a fee.

don't confuse freezes with locks. they work in a similar way, but locks may have monthly fees. if you want a free freeze guaranteed by federal law, then opt for a freeze, not a lock. the following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well):

(1) full name, with middle initial and any suffixes;
(2) social security number;
(3) date of birth;
(4) current address and any previous addresses for the past five years; and
(5) any applicable incident report or complaint with a law enforcement agency or the registry of motor vehicles.

the request must also include a copy of a government-issued identification card and a copy of a recent utility bill or bank or insurance statement. it is essential that each copy be legible, display your name and current mailing address, and the date of issue.

you may further educate yourself regarding identity theft, fraud alerts, credit freezes, and the steps you can take to protect your personal information by contacting the consumer reporting bureaus, the federal trade commission, or your state attorney general. the federal trade commission may be reached at: 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580; www.identitytheft.gov; 1-877-id-theft (1-877-438-4338); and tty: 1-866-653-4261. the federal trade commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. you can obtain further information on how to file such a complaint by way of the contact information listed above. you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity theft or fraud. please note that in order to file a report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some proof that you have been a victim. instances of known or suspected identity theft should also be reported to law enforcement and your state attorney general.	an employee was phished through an email and clicked on a link that redirected them to a fake voicemail service, which then allowed the criminals to access some financial information. limited client information was also accessed, including first and last names, and covid vaccination status.

we discovered that an email or attachment contained your <<data elements>> on december 21, 2021. we take this incident seriously and have implemented additional safeguards and technical security measures to enhance the security of our computer systems. we are also providing additional security awareness training for our staff.

we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity. if you notice any unauthorized charges or activity, please contact the relevant financial institution or credit bureau immediately. as an added precaution, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership with equifax complete premier, including credit monitoring and fraud alerts.

if you have any questions, please call 855-604-1753, monday through friday from 6:00 a.m. through 6:00 p.m. pacific time.

sincerely,
lendus, llc

additional steps you can take:

we recommend that you review your account statements and free credit reports for any unauthorized activity over the next twelve to twenty-four months. you may obtain a copy of your credit report, free of charge, once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to order your annual free credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228.

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report.

if your health insurance or medical information was involved, it is advisable to review the billing statements you receive from your health insurer or healthcare provider. if you see charges for services you did not receive, please contact the insurer or provider immediately.

if your username and password to an online account was involved, it is advisable to change your password to the account as well as any other accounts that use the same or a similar password.

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. to place a freeze on your credit reports, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit bureau to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. if the request is made online or by phone, a credit bureau must lift a freeze within one hour. if the request is made by mail, then the bureau must lift the freeze no later than three business days after getting your request.

if you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit bureau the business will contact for your file, you can save some time by lifting the freeze only at that particular credit bureau. otherwise, you need to make the request with all three credit bureaus.	the breach involving unauthorized access to employee email accounts suggests that this was a hacking incident.

pulsetv is writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that involved some of the information we use to process orders, including information potentially related to you. we take this matter very seriously and are providing this notice to you as a precautionary measure to explain steps that you can take to protect your information.

on march 8, 2021, visa informed us that our website (www.pulsetv.com) was a common point of purchase for some unauthorized credit card transactions and that the website may have a possible compromise. we conducted malware scans, checked our security settings, and cooperated with visa's requests for information. we did not find any ongoing compromise involving customer credit cards, nor were we aware of any customer complaints regarding credit card use on our website prior to hearing from visa.

the next time we heard from visa was in july 2021. we provided additional information at that time and did not have any follow-up from visa or any other card brand. a few months later, law enforcement contacted us regarding additional payment card compromises that appeared to have originated from our website. we then started working with legal counsel with expertise in cybersecurity. legal counsel also hired nationally-recognized cybersecurity experts to assist with the investigation.

on november 18, 2021, our investigator learned that the website had been identified as a common point of purchase for a number of unauthorized credit card transactions for mastercard. based upon communications with the card brands, it is believed that only customers who purchased products on the website with a credit card between november 1, 2019, and august 31, 2021, may have been affected. the investigation was unable to verify that the website was the cause of the unauthorized transactions. however, in an abundance of caution, pulsetv is notifying customers, including you, who purchased products on our website during that time period so that they can take steps to protect and secure their credit card information.

the affected information may have included your name, address, email address, payment card number, expiration date, and card security code (cvv) provided during checkout.

we are continuously working to identify and mitigate threats and evaluate our it security protocols to make sure that sensitive data is protected. in addition, to further improve our website security and help prevent similar occurrences in the future, we have taken, or will be taking, the following steps:

1. adding two-factor authentication requirements for all internal devices;
2. utilizing end-point detection and response tools to provide greater network visibility and threat mitigation; and
3. migrating to a different payment system.

we are also working with the payment card networks to keep them informed and cooperating with the ongoing investigation of the incident by law enforcement. finally, we are providing notice of this incident to appropriate state regulators, consistent with our compliance obligations and responsibilities.

we recommend that you remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. if you believe your payment card information may have been compromised, we strongly encourage you to contact your payment card company and/or financial institution and request that the card be canceled.

if you have any further questions, please contact us at 1-855-618-3212, monday through friday, 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., eastern time (excluding some u.s. holidays).

sincerely,

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the federal trade commission and/or the attorney general's office in your state. you can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. you should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. contact information for the federal trade commission is as follows:

federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft

fraud alerts and credit or security freezes:

fraud alerts: there are two types of general fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years.

to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the nationwide credit bureaus. a fraud alert is free. the credit bureau you contact must tell the other two, and all three will place an alert on their versions of your report.

for those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, an active duty military fraud alert lasts for one year and can be renewed for the length of your deployment. the credit bureaus will also take you off their marketing lists for pre-screened credit card offers for two years, unless you ask them not to.

credit or security freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, which makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. that's because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. if they can't see your report, they may not extend the credit.

how do i place a freeze on my credit reports? there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com

pellissippi state community college (pscc) is informing individuals of a recent data security incident that may have resulted in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, some personal information of our former and current students, faculty, and staff and participants in tennessee consortium for international studies (tncis) programs.

what happened?

pscc was the victim of a ransomware cyberattack overnight on december 5-6, 2021. we have confirmed unauthorized access to one system, but it is possible that others may have been accessed. while pscc was also a victim, we apologize for any stress and concern this has caused.

what information was involved?

our investigation confirmed that the attacker had access to our active directory database, which includes first and last name; pscc username; pscc email address; office location and phone number; job title and department (if an employee); p number (a unique number assigned to each student and employee used only at pscc and not used to sign documents); general user id number (a long random string of numbers used only by pscc in its banner system); and pscc account password (hashed). this was the only database to which access was confirmed. it is possible, however, that other personal data in our system could have been accessed.

what we are doing

contents of data breach notification letter: notice of data breach

at faneuil, we value the trust that individuals place in us with their information, and we understand the importance of protecting information that we maintain. for these reasons, we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that involved your personal information. this notice explains the incident, measures that we have taken in response, and steps that you may consider taking as well.

what happened?

we learned on august 18, 2021, that we were the target of a ransomware attack. in response, we immediately isolated all impacted systems to disrupt the attack and prevent further access by the attackers, and, working with independent cybersecurity experts, we launched a forensic investigation into the causes and impacts of the incident, as we also sought to rebuild systems and recover from the attack. in the course of our investigation, we learned that, prior to launching the attack, the attackers accessed and copied certain company records, including records of past and present faneuil employees. because we value protecting individuals' information, we engaged with the ransomware group and ultimately paid them, and we received confirmation from the attackers that they destroyed all copied information. in addition, during our investigation and response to the incident, we engaged a digital risk protection firm to perform internet and dark web monitoring for indications of faneuil data. at this time, we have no reason to believe that any of the data went beyond the attackers, or was misused or made publicly available.

to help protect your information, we are offering a 24-month membership in experian identityworks. directions for how to enroll in this service are provided below.

what information was involved?

the employment records accessed by the ransomware attackers included names, addresses at the time of employment, social security numbers, phone numbers, and email addresses.

what we are doing

when we learned of this incident, we immediately isolated all systems to disrupt the attack and prevent further access by the attackers, and we engaged independent cybersecurity experts to investigate the causes and impacts of the incident. we also engaged an independent data risk protection firm to facilitate communications with the attackers. to protect individuals' personal information, we ultimately paid the attackers and received confirmation that they destroyed all copied information. in addition, we reported the incident to and cooperated with law enforcement. as part of our response to the incident, we implemented additional information security measures and rebuilt systems, to prevent any persistence of these attackers, to prevent similar future incidents, and to enhance the protection of information that we hold. we are confident that our efforts to contain the attack and additional security measures will prevent similar attacks in the future.

for several hundred charities. the company immediately quarantined the malware. in the days
following the malware's quarantine, the company's initial review of the system suggested the
server had been used by an unknown intruder as part of a botnet, and produced no evidence that
personal identifiable information had been accessed or stolen. however, on june i, 20 i 5, during
a subsequent third party review of the server, the company discovered evidence suggesting that
the intruder may have removed data from the server to an external system on three occasions
during the first quarter of 2015. despite an extensive analysis conducted by a third party
forensics investigator, the company could not determine what company data (if any) was
removed from the server. & the donor records stored on the company's server primarily consisted of names, addresses,
phone numbers, and email addresses used to process the vehicle donations. a smaller subset
included social security numbers and driver's license numbers. analysis to date suggests that the	malware was detected on a server used for processing donations, and evidence suggests that an unknown intruder removed data from the server to an external system on three occasions during the first quarter of 2015. despite extensive analysis, the company could not determine what company data (if any) was removed from the server.

the investor protection unit of the delaware department of justice (the "ipu") recently
became aware of an inadvertent disclosure of personal information housed in the central
registration depository and investment adviser registration depository ( collectively, the
"registration systems") maintained by the financial industry regulatory authority ("finra"). & the reports included one (or more) docket/case number(s) (the "case numbers") the
affected individuals supplied on a judgment, lien, or bankruptcy disclosure reporting page
("drp"). we became aware that, for certain individuals, one or more of these case numbers
reflected personal information such as a social security number, bank account number, or other
personal identification number.	the personal information housed in the registration systems was inadvertently disclosed through an unintended disclosure, rather than through hacking or physical theft.
the purpose of this notice is to infonn you that personal infonnation relating to your
registration as a broker-dealer agent and/or investment adviser representative may have been
inadvertently released by the investor protection unit of the delaware department of justice (the
"ipu") as part of bulk data requests, even though the ipu had taken steps to exclude such
infonnation.
as an applicant for securities industry registration in delaware you have filed and
submitted infonnation and disclosures that are housed in the central registration depository and
investment adviser registration depository (collectively, the "registration systems")
maintained by the financial industry regulatory authority ("finra"). between august 2012
and february 2015, pursuant to one or more freedom of information act ("foia") request(s),
the investor protection unit of the delaware department of justice (the "ipu") provided reports
(the "reports") from the registration systems to journalists, academics, financial industry
database/marketing contact finns, and other requesters. the reports, which were generated by
finra at delaware's request for use in responding to foia requests, provided infonnation
gathered from fonns u4 and us for all broker-dealer agents and investment adviser
representatives registered in delaware at the time the reports were generated & the reports included one (or more) docket/case number(s) (the "case numbers") you
supplied on a judgment, lien, or bankruptcy disclosure reporting page ("drp"). it has come to
our attention that one or more of these case numbers Â«pi_ textÂ». although you may have
indicated on the pertinent drp(s) that the case number(s) contained personal infonnation, until
recently the registration systems' software did not suppress case numbers that may have
included this indication. the ipu requested for the reports to exclude social security numbers
and other personal infonnation, and the reports did exclude or mask social security numbers and
other personal infonnation entered in fields specifically soliciting that infonnation. the ipu was
unaware that personal infonnation remained embedded in the case/docket field.	personal information for registration as a broker-dealer agent and/or investment adviser representative may have been inadvertently released as part of a bulk data request made to financial industry firms, academics, journalists and other requesters through freedom of information act (foia) requests.

apologize to anyone who has been inconvenienced as a result of these highly sophisticated, criminal
cyberattacks. we have conducted a rigorous investigation to understand what has happened and we are

sale systems, and had worked with our investigator to disable it. on june 91h, we reported that we had
discovered additional malicious cyber activity involving other restaurants. that malware has also been
disabled in all franchisee restaurants where it has been discovered. we believe that both criminal
cyberattacks resulted from service providers' remote access credentials being compromised, allowing
access - and the ability to deploy malware - to some franchisees' point-of-sale systems. & we believe that both criminal

wendy's recently reported additional malicious cyber activity involving some franchisee-operated
restaurants. the company believes this criminal cyberattack resulted from a service provider's remote
access credentials being compromised, allowing access - and the ability to deploy malware - to some
franchisees' pos systems. soon after detecting the malware, wendy's identified a method of disabling
it and thereafter has disabled the malware in all franchisee restaurants where it has been discovered. the
investigation has confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on
some wendy's franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015. & based on the facts known to wendy's at this time, the additional malware targeted the following
payment card data: cardholder name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, cardholder
verification value, and service code. please note that the cardholder verification value that may have
been put at risk is not the three or four digit value that is printed on the back or front of cards, which is
sometimes used in online transactions.	the breach was a result of a service provider's remote access credentials being compromised, allowing access to franchisee-operated restaurants' pos systems and ability to deploy malware. wendy's identified and disabled the malware in all franchisee restaurants where it was discovered. investigation confirmed malware was deployed on some wendy's franchisee systems in late fall 2015. payment card data including cardholder name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, cardholder verification value, and service code was targeted.
on behalf of my client, schwan's horne service, inc. ("schwan' s" ), please allow this
correspondence to serve as written notification that cardsource, a third-party vendor which
produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the schwan 'spayÂ® accounts of my
client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the federal
bureau of investigation that the records of 323 ia schwan 's customers, as of august i, 2016 may
have been exposed to a hacker of fore ign origin as far back as october 9, 2015. while there is no
record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the cardsource
systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively
considered by schwan's to be compromised.
these records were held by cardsource in a contracted data center, and contained the following
information for those 323 c ustomers: name, address, phone number, ema il address and
schwan 'spayÂ® card number. the schwan 'spayÂ® card number ties directly to each customer's
schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on
file with schwan's. all 323 affected schwan'spayÂ® cards on file with cardsource have been
disabled by schwan's out of an abundance of caution, and upon thorough review, no fraudulent
or even questionable activity has been detected in those customers' accounts. the like lihood of
actual harm, financ ial or otherwise, is by my client's reasonable calculation to be extremely low
or non-existent due to the fact that the card can only be used for purchases with schwan's and
alignment of a ll three accounts is necessary for a debit transaction; however, the possibility of
phishing or social engineering scams cannot be entirely ruled out. & name, address, phone number, ema il address and
schwan 'spayÂ® card number.	the breach involves unauthorized access to the payment card information of schwan's horne service, inc's customers that was held by a third-party vendor, cardsource. the compromised information of the affected 323 customers included their names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses as well as schwan'spay® card numbers which ties directly to each customer's schwan's account thereby enabling debiting of their bank accounts. all the affected schwan'spay® cards have been disabled to prevent any potential fraudulent activity.

on behalf of my client, schwan's horne service, inc. ("schwan's"), please allow this
correspondence to serve as written notification that cardsource, a third-party vendor which
produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the schwan 'spayâ€‚ accounts of my
client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the federal
bureau of investigation that the records of 323 ia schwan 's customers, as of august i, 2016 may
have been exposed to a hacker of foreign origin as far back as october 9, 2015. while there is no
record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the cardsource
systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively
considered by schwan's to be compromised.
these records were held by cardsource in a contracted data center, and contained the following
information for those 323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and
schwan 'spayâ€‚ card number. the schwan 'spayâ€‚ card number ties directly to each customer's
schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on
file with schwan's.&323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and
schwan 'spayâ€‚ card number. the schwan 'spayâ€‚ card number ties directly to each customer's
schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on
file with schwan's.	the breach involved the exposure of schwan's home service corporation's customers' debit card information through a third-party vendor, cardsource, which produces numbered plastic payment cards uniquely for schwan's.

behalf. your corrected tax form(s) were included in that mailing. your information inadvertently went to
your older address rather than to the current mailing address we have on file. as with all 1099 forms, that
document contained your name, address, eight-digit scottrade account number and the last four digits of
your social security number. & contained your name, address, eight-digit scottrade account number and the last four digits of
your social security number.	the breach was caused by unintended disclosure due to the mailing vendor sending corrected tax forms to the wrong address, which contained customer's personal information including name, address, account number, and ssn.
as part of a normal reconciliation process, in july 2015, scottrade provided revised 1099 forms for the tax years 2012 and 2013 to approximately 18,000 clients. these forms were mailed by a vendor, wall street concepts (wsc). wsc inadvertently mailed 1258 of these forms using addresses that scottrade clients had provided for the 2012 and/or 2013 tax years, and which had not been updated to reflect changes of address. as a result these mailings were sent to old and outdated addresses. 428 of those have now been returned to our offices as undeliverable, leaving 812 with unknown outcomes. those 1099 forms contained the client's name, address, eight-digit scottrade account number and the last four digits of their social security number. scottrade became aware of the situation when contacted by clients who had become aware of mail being sent to their old addresses. our investigation has determined that the address problem was limited to the 1240 client accounts which have been identified. the cause of the discrepancy has been located and scottrade is taking corrective action.	the breach was an unintended disclosure, as personal information was sent to the wrong addresses due to outdated information provided by clients.

this incident first came to gyft's attention on december 3, 2015, when it learned that a file available on the internet appeared to contain gyft user records. it was not immediately apparent how the file had been created, and gyft did not discover that its cloud providers had been accessed without authorization until approximately december 28, 2015. the unknown individual(s) that accessed the cloud providers used valid gyft credentials. as of the date of this letter, gyft has not determined how the credentials were obtained or who obtained them. 
when gyft became aware of this incident, it appeared that log files, including usernames and passwords, dating as far back as march 19, 2015 had been compromised. accordingly, gyft immediately reset user passwords for all users who had logged in during that time period. upon identifying unauthorized logins to its cloud providers, gyft reviewed all files stored with the cloud providers that were potentially accessed without authorization, and is notifying all gyft users whose sensitive personal information was available in the potentially accessed files. gyft has also forced password resets and/or logouts for additional affected users as those users were identified.& names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and gift card numbers	access to cloud providers was gained without authorization, using valid gyft credentials. it is unknown how the credentials were obtained, making this a case of hacking.

olympia hotel management, manager of the brunswick hotel & tavern located at 4 noble street,
brunswick, maine, recently discovered malware on the hotel's computer systems that may have
resulted in unauthorized access to name and payment card information. as a recent guest of the hotel,
we are writing to provide you with information about this incident, to share the steps that we are taking
in response, and to provide you with important information about the steps you can take to reduce the
risk of unauthorized use of your personal information. we regret any inconvenience this incident may
have caused.
what happened:
based on our investigation to date, it appears that one of the front desk computers at the hotel was
infected with sophisticated malware designed to capture and permit remote access to name and
payment card information while avoiding detection by anti-virus software. on august 12, 2015, our
security consultants determined that the malware may have been active on that front desk system
between november 29, 2014 and july 21, 2015. as a result, your information may have been exposed.
although we do not have conclusive evidence that your information was actually accessed remotely, we
have not been able to rule that out and encourage you to take advantage of the credit monitoring and
other resources we provide below. & name and payment card information	the presence of malware on the hotel's computer systems indicates that the breach was caused by an outside party or malware infection.
findings from the investigation show that an unauthorized person installed malware on certain servers that processed payment cards used at some of our hotels. the malware searched for track data read from the magnetic stripe of payment cards as it was being routed through the affected servers. the malware primarily found track data that contained the card number, expiration date, and internal verification code, but in some instances it found the track that also contains the cardholder name. & the malware primarily found track data that contained the card number, expiration date, and internal verification code, but in some instances it found the track that also contains the cardholder name.	the unauthorized person installed malware on certain servers that processed payment cards at some hotels, allowing them to access track data from the magnetic stripe of payment cards.
on behalf of my client, schwan's horne service, inc. ("schwan's"), please allow this correspondence to serve as written notification that cardsource, a third-party vendor which produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the schwan 'spayÂ® accounts of my client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the federal bureau of investigation that the records of 323 ia schwan 's customers, as of august i, 2016 may have been exposed to a hacker of foreign origin as far back as october 9, 2015. while there is no record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the cardsource systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively considered by schwan's to be compromised. 
these records were held by cardsource in a contracted data center, and contained the following information for those 323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and schwan 'spayÂ® card number. the schwan 'spayÂ® card number ties directly to each customer's schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on file with schwan's. all 323 affected schwan'spayÂ® cards on file with cardsource have been disabled by schwan's out of an abundance of caution, and upon thorough review, no fraudulent or even questionable activity has been detected in those customers' accounts. the likelihood of actual harm, financial or otherwise, is by my client's reasonable calculation to be extremely low or non-existent due to the fact that the card can only be used for purchases with schwan's and alignment of all three accounts is necessary for a debit transaction; however, the possibility of phishing or social engineering scams cannot be entirely ruled out.& name, address, phone number, email address and schwan 'spayÂ® card number	the breach involved the compromise of the schwan’spay® card number of 323 ia schwan's customers, tied solely to schwan’s accounts, which can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on file with schwan's. all 323 affected schwan'spay® cards have been disabled as a precaution, but no fraudulent activity has been detected.

choice recently learned of a technical issue that only occurred in a specific circumstance. the cause of
the issue has been addressed. the issue involved information entered by a visitor to choiceâ€™s website
being inadvertently accessible to third parties, with whom choice has a business relationship, when the
visitorâ€™s web browser crashed while on the site. choice uses technology to track activities that occur on
its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to choice.
for visitors to choiceâ€™s website who used the safari web browser, if safari crashed and restarted, safari
would put information that had been typed by the visitor on the page into the website address for that
page. tracking technology reads the website address of pages on choiceâ€™s website and sends the data
to third parties. except in a safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information
entered by visitors. we believe this occurred because of how the code for safari was written. this
specific issue occurred approximately 88,000 times from june 2015 through november 12, 2019. & f a visitor to choiceâ€™s website was using safari and on the reservation page, the information that had
been typed in fields on that page that could have been put in the website address when the browser
restarted after a crash may include the name of the person making the reservation, email address, state,
zip code, country code, and the number and expiration date of the payment card used to make the
reservation. we are notifying you because this scenario occurred when you were making a reservation.
if you were making a reservation using a mixture of points and payment, the external verification value
on the card may have also been in the website address. the last four digits of the card you used were
[wxyz].	the technical issue that occurred in this specific circumstance involved inadvertent access to information entered by a visitor to choice's website when the visitor's web browser crashed. the cause of the issue has been addressed.

on friday, february 15, 2019, while trying to resolve an email failure with our email host, 
suddenlink, i was directed to a website that gave a phone number to call for immediate assistance.
when i called this number, the technician stated he could certainly help.he requested access to 
my computer to understand the issue with the email.after i installed the software necessary to 
give him remote access to my computer, he pulled up some ip addresses on my computer screen and 
stated that this was the reason for the email failure.he then insisted that in order to fix the 
problem and prevent viruses from attacking, i would need to allow him to install a program on our 
officeâ€™s network server. i told him no and that our local computer technician would be contacted 
to deal with this. at that point, he stated that only a microsoft tech such as himself would be 
able to do this. this was a red flag as i thought i was dealing with a suddenlink technician. 
at that point, i quickly disconnected my computer from the internet and from our office network.i 
then uninstalled the remote access software i had just allowed him to install, and turned the 
computer off. this entire interaction lasted less than eight minutes.

our local computer technician was contacted immediately.they indicated that this was a known scam 
and that they try to copy information that exists on the computer they are given access to and, to 
their knowledge, are not
able to move beyond that initial local hard drive quickly, if at all.
& the information that was most at risk of being breached were those documents in the â€œmy documentsâ€ 
folder on my computer as well as those saved on my computer.on my desktop, i kept a folder of 
items that had been emailed.if i have emailed a copy of your tax returns or other document, which 
contains your personal data, in the recent past, your data was most at risk of being compromised.
we also discovered that older years of our tax program saved on my computer were not encrypted. at 
this time, it is unknown what, if anything, was taken from
my computer in the short amount of time that the breach occured.
	the breach occurred when a technician, posing to be a suddenlink technician, accessed the organization's computer remotely and asked to install a program on the office's network server claiming that it was necessary to fix the email failure issue and prevent viruses from attacking. the technician's request was denied, and the computer was quickly disconnected from the internet and the office network. it is unknown what data was taken, making this a likely hacking incident.

jobscience was informed by agents from the federal bureau oflnvestigation (fbi) in august 2018 that
the agents had observed certain data being exfiltrated from a jobscience server. after the fbi provided
jobscience a copy of the data on august 21, 2018, jobscience confirmed that the data did, in fact, come
from a jobscience server. subsequent investigation determined that a legacy jobscience talentpath
server that housed information related to individuals who had applied for positions with jobscience
customers was accessed by an unauthorized third party, who then exfiltrated the data housed on the
server (the "attack"). while certain information in the server was encrypted at rest, the results of the
investigation suggest that the unauthorized party may have had sufficient access as to be able to exfiltrate
the decryption mechanism. no other elements of the jobscience environment are believed to be involved
in the attack.
jobscience took prompt action upon confirming that the data came from its server. specifically:
â€¢ jobscience initiated an investigation to identify (i) the root cause of the attack and (ii) the nature
and scope of the compromised data. to aid in its investigation, jobscience retained outside

page 2 of 3
forensic auditors to conduct an independent review of the details surrounding the incident and
the data involved.
â€¢ jobscience notified all customers that had information in the implicated server about the attack
on august 28, 2018, via letter and telephone, and thereafter provided each customer with details
about their implicated data.
â€¢ after an initial investigation identified the potential vulnerability used in the attack, jobscience
took steps to resolve the vulnerability by (i) deploying a patched version of the server and
migrating all of its customers to the patched server, and (ii) updating user credentials by forcing
all administrators and users to update their passwords.
â€¢ jobscience retained a database consultant to analyze the data exfiltrated in the attack to identify
affected records and the customers to which those records belonged. in september 2018,
jobscience provided to those customers detailed information regarding the affected records that
jobscience had identified as belonging to the customer, to assist the customers with any
applicable notification obligations. 1 further analysis of the database identified additional records
belonging to these customers that was implicated in the attack, and jobscience intends to
supplement our previous reports to those customers with this new information.
in addition, this further analysis of the database identified two new categories of implicated records:
(i) records that relate to jobscience's historic use of the platform for its own hiring and applicant
management processes; and (ii) records that are not readily attributable to any particular jobscience
customer. jobscience is providing notice to individuals whose information falls into these two
categories, as well as to individuals whose records belong to a customer but who have not been
previously notified (unless the customer affirmatively tells jobscience that it wants to perform the
notification). jobscience is providing this notice to you because our records indicate that 501 individuals
that jobscience intends to notify are residents of new hampshire. & (i) records that relate to jobscience's historic use of the platform for its own hiring and applicant
management processes; and (ii) records that are not readily attributable to any particular jobscience
customer	data was exfiltrated from a jobscience server which housed information related to individuals who had applied for positions with jobscience customers. the server was accessed by an unauthorized third party who exfiltrated the data. investigation suggested that the unauthorized party may have had sufficient access to exfiltrate the decryption mechanism.

we recently discovered that the email account of one of our employees was compromised. although we
do not know the duration of the compromise, or with certainty what information may have been accessed,
we have reason to believe that an unauthorized individual gained access to an employeeâ€™s email account
and may have received copies of emails sent from the account from approximately 2/13/2009 through
4/18/2019. as soon as we became aware of this, we immediately secured the email account and engaged
a forensic it firm to investigate the incident, and notified law enforcement. at this time, aquionix and its
investigators believe that the relevant security vulnerability has been remediated. & what information was involved?
the information potentially affected by this security incident varied depending on context, for example,
the content of the email and information provided by the individual, whether the individual sent or
received emails during the applicable time period, or underwent a background check or
employment/contractor onboarding during the applicable period. information may include the content of
background check applications or reports, tax forms, health insurance, forms, or other documentation you
provided in connection with your application for employment, or in connection with the creation of your
employment or contractor relationship with aquionix. though additional information may have been
compromised, we have reason to believe that the following information may have been accessed or
acquired: your first and last name; email address; mailing address; phone number; social security number.
we do not have any way to determine whether the recipient of the emails actually opened or viewed the
information within any of the emails.	the breach was the result of an unauthorized individual accessing an employee's email account.

as part of a multi-step initiative to fully encrypt the servers at all of our locations, a
scheduled server replacement was performed on june 2, 2014 in our visionworks
store at jennifer square, 169 jennifer road, annapolis, maryland. following the
replacement, the partially encrypted decommissioned server was placed in a box and
stored temporarily in the in-store lab until it was recalled and shipped back to the
san antonio home office. on october 27, 2014, the server was recalled, and it was
discovered that it was missing from the store.
an investigation immediately ensued which revealed that a remodel of the store
began on june 15, 2014, shortly after the server replacement. the investigation
further revealed that significant amounts of construction material and debris was
removed from the store and disposed of in construction dumpsters during that time.
although we are unable to conclusively confirm, all of the facts of the investigation
suggest, and we strongly suspect, that the server was placed into the dumpster used
for construction waste by either an employee or contractor. we have every reason
to conclude that the server is now buried in a local landfill.
our investigation further revealed that the server's hard drive contained fewer than
100 records of encrypted credit card holder data ("cho") which was stored for three
(3) days from the time of the transaction (i.e., the encrypted, unreadable cho
impacted includes data from may 31, 2014, through june 2, 2014, when the server
was decommissioned). the server's hard drive also contained unencrypted pl and
phi from the store's opening in 1997 through june 2, 2014. there was no customer
data on this server after june 2, 2014. & as part of the investigation, we have attempted to identify the types of unencrypted
data on the server. the missing data included the following data elements: name;
address; home and work telephone numbers; health insurance information, including
group name, group number, vision care expiration date and a member id with up to
13 digits; date of birth; gender; occupation; referral source; service type and purpose
of the visit; date of last visit; current balance; patient status; work order information,
including examination information, comments and several eye glass frame, optical
prescription and production related fields; and encrypted cho.

there were also two social security number ("ssn") fields available in the database;
however, those fields were not populated. in some very limited cases, the member
id field may contain a ssn embedded within the full member id; however, the field
was not labeled as a ssn, and there is no reason to believe that anyone would
identify this number as containing a ssn.	the breach involved the loss of a partially encrypted server that was stored in a box in-store and later went missing after store remodeling. the server contained unencrypted personal health information (phi) and protected credit card holder data (cho). although we are unable to conclusively confirm, all of the facts of the investigation suggest, and we strongly suspect, that the server was placed into the dumpster used for construction waste by either an employee or contractor.
at this time, it appears that an unauthorized third person or
persons obtained access to that system between november 2013 and march 2014, although that is still being confirmed.
we do want to make you aware of what personal data of yours was in the payroll data system and may have been accessed by the unauthorized person:
full name

on behalf of my client, schwan's horne service, inc. ("schwan's"), please allow this correspondence to serve as written notification that cardsource, a third-party vendor which produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the schwan 'spayÂ® accounts of my client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the federal bureau of investigation that the records of 323 ia schwan 's customers, as of august i, 2016 may have been exposed to a hacker of foreign origin as far back as october 9, 2015. while there is no record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the cardsource systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively considered by schwan's to be compromised. 
these records were held by cardsource in a contracted data center, and contained the following information for those 323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and schwan 'spayÂ® card number. the schwan 'spayÂ® card number ties directly to each customer's schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on file with schwan's. all 323 affected schwan'spayÂ® cards on file with cardsource have been disabled by schwan's out of an abundance of caution, and upon thorough review, no fraudulent or even questionable activity has been detected in those customers' accounts. the likelihood of actual harm, financial or otherwise, is by my client's reasonable calculation to be extremely low or non-existent due to the fact that the card can only be used for purchases with schwan's and alignment of all three accounts is necessary for a debit transaction; however, the possibility of phishing or social engineering scams cannot be entirely ruled out.& name, address, phone number, email address and schwan 'spayÂ® card number	the breach involved the compromise of 323 schwan'spay® card numbers and other personal information, held by a third-party vendor, cardsource, that produces payment cards tied solely to the schwan's account of the company's customers.

as part of a multi-step initiative to fully encrypt the servers at all of our locations, a
scheduled server replacement was performed on june 2, 2014 in our visionworks
store at jennifer square, 169 jennifer road, annapolis, maryland. following the
replacement, the partially encrypted decommissioned server was placed in a box and
stored temporarily in the in-store lab until it was recalled and shipped back to the
san antonio home office. on october 27, 2014, the server was recalled, and it was
discovered that it was missing from the store.
an investigation immediately ensued which revealed that a remodel of the store
began on june 15, 2014, shortly after the server replacement. the investigation
further revealed that significant amounts of construction material and debris was
removed from the store and disposed of in construction dumpsters during that time.
although we are unable to conclusively confirm, all of the facts of the investigation
suggest, and we strongly suspect, that the server was placed into the dumpster used
for construction waste by either an employee or contractor. we have every reason
to conclude that the server is now buried in a local landfill.
our investigation further revealed that the server's hard drive contained fewer than
100 records of encrypted credit card holder data ("cho") which was stored for three
(3) days from the time of the transaction (i.e., the encrypted, unreadable cho
impacted includes data from may 31, 2014, through june 2, 2014, when the server
was decommissioned). the server's hard drive also contained unencrypted pl and
phi from the store's opening in 1997 through june 2, 2014. there was no customer
data on this server after june 2, 2014. & as part of the investigation, we have attempted to identify the types of unencrypted
data on the server. the missing data included the following data elements: name;
address; home and work telephone numbers; health insurance information, including
group name, group number, vision care expiration date and a member id with up to
13 digits; date of birth; gender; occupation; referral source; service type and purpose
of the visit; date of last visit; current balance; patient status; work order information,
including examination information, comments and several eye glass frame, optical
prescription and production related fields; and encrypted cho.

there were also two social security number ("ssn") fields available in the database;
however, those fields were not populated. in some very limited cases, the member
id field may contain a ssn embedded within the full member id; however, the field
was not labeled as a ssn, and there is no reason to believe that anyone would
identify this number as containing a ssn.	the breach involved the physical loss of a partially encrypted decommissioned server that was temporarily stored in a box within the store and was later discovered missing.
at this time, it appears that an unauthorized third person or
persons obtained access to that system between november 2013 and march 2014, although that is still being confirmed.
we do want to make you aware of what personal data of yours was in the payroll data system and may have been accessed by the unauthorized person:
full name
address
date of birth - excluding foster parents

parents, bank routing number and account number if direct deposit was ever used.	based on the information provided, it appears that an unauthorized person or persons accessed the organization's payroll data system between november 2013 and march 2014. this suggests that the breach was a result of an outside party hacking into their system.

on behalf of my client, schwan's horne service, inc. ("schwan's"), please allow this correspondence to serve as written notification that cardsource, a third-party vendor which produces numbered plastic payment cards tied solely to the schwan 'spayÂ® accounts of my client's customers, has determined after exhaustive investigation and assistance of the federal bureau of investigation that the records of 323 ia schwan 's customers, as of august i, 2016 may have been exposed to a hacker of foreign origin as far back as october 9, 2015. while there is no record that any or all of these customer records may have been accessed in the cardsource systems by the hacker, they were vulnerable to viewing and therefore are conservatively considered by schwan's to be compromised. 
these records were held by cardsource in a contracted data center, and contained the following information for those 323 customers: name, address, phone number, email address and schwan 'spayÂ® card number. the schwan 'spayÂ® card number ties directly to each customer's schwan's account, which in turn can allow for the debiting of that customer's bank account on file with schwan's. all 323 affected schwan'spayÂ® cards on file with cardsource have been disabled by schwan's out of an abundance of caution, and upon thorough review, no fraudulent or even questionable activity has been detected in those customers' accounts. the likelihood of actual harm, financial or otherwise, is by my client's reasonable calculation to be extremely low or non-existent due to the fact that the card can only be used for purchases with schwan's and alignment of all three accounts is necessary for a debit transaction; however, the possibility of phishing or social engineering scams cannot be entirely ruled out.& name, address, phone number, email address and schwan 'spayÂ® card number	the breach involved the compromise of payment card related information for customers of schwan's home service corporation due to a hack affecting a third-party vendor.

on july 26, 2019, stockx was alerted to suspicious activity potentially involving customer data. we immediately
launched a forensic investigation and engaged experienced third-party experts to assist. during this first week, while
our forensic investigation into the suspicious activity was underway, we took proactive and precautionary measures
to protect our customers. as described in greater detail in the â€œwhat are we doingâ€ section below, we deployed a
system-wide update, implemented a full password reset of all customer passwords for all stockx accounts, and on
the morning of august 1, 2019 sent customers an email alerting them to the systems update and password reset.
as our investigation continued, forensic evidence revealed that an unknown third party had been able to gain
unauthorized access to certain customer data from our cloud environment on or around may 14, 2019. we worked
swiftly to issue an email update of the matter to our customers and are now making this notification to further
apprise you of additional facts from our investigation.

as part of our efforts to catch the perpetrator, we have contacted law enforcement and have been working with them
in their investigation of the incident. our investigation into the nature, extent, and scope of the incident remains
ongoing, and we will update you with additional information as necessary. & what information was involved?
from our investigation to date, the information affected may include your name, email address, address, username,
hashed password, and purchase history.
as indicated in our prior communications, there is no evidence to date to suggest that any of your financial or
payment information has been affected. that is because stockx does not store full payment card or financial data
of its customers on its network servers or platform. instead, any stockx payment card data is processed, stored, and
hosted by a third-party payment processor, and not stockx. based on our investigation to date, we have no evidence
to suggest that our third-party payment processing partners or our third-party platform has been affected by this
incident, nor do we have any evidence to suggest that any of the customer financial or payment information stored
by that third-party has been affected.	an unknown third party was able to gain unauthorized access to certain customer data from the cloud environment on or around may 14, 2019. the breach was discovered by the organization on july 26, 2019.
