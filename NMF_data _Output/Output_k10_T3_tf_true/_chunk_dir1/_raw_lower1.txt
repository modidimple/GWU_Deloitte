and what information contained within the email accounts may be affected. the investigation determined that the
accounts at issue experienced unauthorized access between january 8, 2018 and august 7, 2018. the contents of
the accounts were reviewed through an in-depth manual and programmatic process to determine what sensitive data
may have been accessible. on december 26, 2018, we confirmed the identities of the individuals who may have had
information accessible as a result of the incident and promptly launched a review of our files to ascertain address
information for the impacted individuals.& while we currently have no evidence that your information was subject to actual or attempted misuse, we have confirmed

beginning on or about march 29, 2019 through and including may 6, 2019, symmetry received ten email
communications that appeared to be from carl smith or cjs financial containing fraudulent transaction
requests, regarding six of his customers. no other customers of symmetry were involved in any way; only
customers of cjs financial were involved. at the time, the requests appeared genuine because they came
from a cjs financial email account and had correct account information as well as the correct e*trade
custody information; along with an accurate copy of your signature; and so the requests were honored.
subsequently, symmetry was informed that these requests were fraudulent.
to help understand the situation, symmetry hired a leading thirdâ€party computer forensic expert, stroz
friedberg, an aon company, to review its systems. on june 4, 2019, stroz friedberg issued a report
concluding that the fraudulent emails were likely sent from cjs financialâ€™s system, and that symmetry did
not suffer a breach of its email system. based on this report, our understanding is that symmetryâ€™s computer
system data have not been improperly accessed or compromised.
unfortunately, we do not have insight into the computer environment at cjs financial, and they have not
agreed to give us access to the relevant logs. accordingly, your best source of further information about this
incident is by contacting cjs financial by mail at 1 tara boulevard, ste. 200, nashua nh 03062 or by phone
at (954) 825â€0309. & what information was involved?

personal account data held at cjs financial, including full account information, social security numbers,
name, and address. because any potential compromise of your information did not occur at symmetry and
we do not have access to the files of cjs financial, we are unable to provide particular information about
what information was actually involved.	the fraudulent transaction requests were made by someone using information from a cjs financial email account, suggesting that debit or credit card information may have been obtained fraudulently.

we recently began an investigation of our e-commerce website after a guest called to report that an unauthorized charge occurred on their payment card after they used it to make a purchase from our website, https://www .graeters.com. a leading cybersecurity firm was then engaged to determine what had happened and what information may have been involved. by june 28, 2019, findings from the investigation indicated that the code may have been present from december 30, 2018 to june 13, 2019 and may have been capable of copying information entered by guests during the checkout process. we are notifying you because you placed an order on our website during that time. & the information entered during the checkout process that could have been copied includes first and last name, address, telephone number, payment card number, expiration date, and card verification code.	the unauthorized charge occurred on a payment card used for purchases from the e-commerce website, which suggests that the breach involved a card rather than other types of data. the information that was potentially copied during the checkout process also includes payment card information, further supporting this classification.

earlier this year, adams 12 became aware of unusual activity from an outside source accessing an adams 12
employeeâ€™s email account. we immediately began an investigation to determine what happened and what information
may have been affected. with the assistance of third-party forensic investigators, we determined that certain
employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized access from outside sources between february 15, and
february 19, 2019. because the initial assessment was unable to identify what, if any, emails were viewed without
authorization, we began an extensive investigation to understand all information within the email accounts that

information was actually viewed by an unauthorized user. our investigation was only able to determine your information was
present in emails and/or attachments in the email accounts subject to unauthorized access. & what information was involved?
the email accounts subject to unauthorized access contained the following types of information relating to you: your
<<clientdef1>><<clientdef2>>. to date, we have not received any reports of actual or attempted misuse of personal

housing or other services.
to place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written requestto each of the three

you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number
(pin) or password, or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the
security freeze.
to lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report,
you must call or send a written request to the credit reporting agencies by mail and include proper
identification (name, address, and social security number) and the pin number or password
provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identities of those entities or
individuals youwould like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the

what happened? calibre recently became aware of suspicious activity related to certain employee email accounts, as
well as one of our computer servers. we immediately launched an investigation to determine the full nature and scope
of the email activity and what information may have been affected. with the assistance of computer forensics experts,
we learned that one of our computer servers as well as certain calibre employee email accounts were accessed without
authorization between march 11, 2019 and may 7, 2019.
working with these third-party experts, we undertook a comprehensive review of the impacted email accounts and
impacted server to determine if they contained personal information and received confirmation on the number of
potentially impacted individuals on june 26, 2019. however, based on the information contained within the affected
data, we still lacked complete information related to the potentially affected individuals and were unable to adequately
identify the various organizations and/or businesses from whom the information originated. we subsequently undertook
a lengthy internal review of our systems and determined that information related to you was accessible during the period
of potential compromise. unfortunately, however, we are unable to determine if your personal information was actually
accessed during the incident.
we are therefore notifying you in an abundance of caution because your information was present and potentially
accessible at the time of the incident.

unauthorized individual. we learned that the impacted email accounts contained images of some of calibre's employer
payroll compliance audit reports and or schedules for employers that contribute to the fund. however, calibre's
investigation confirmed the information present at the time of the incident may include your <<b2b_text_1>>. this
information was in calibre's possession for the purpose of conducting payroll compliance reviews of the employers who
make contributions to the fund on your behalf. these reviews are used to confirm that your employers reported the
correct number of hours, and paid the correct amount of contributions, to the fund for your work. & your <<b2b_text_1>>	the unauthorized access of calibre's computer server and employee email accounts suggests that this is a result of an outside party or malware infection. the statement "one of our computer servers as well as certain calibre employee email accounts were accessed without authorization" confirms that this is a hack.

edonor donor portal. a prompt investigation with our software vendor, haemonetics
software solutions, revealed that between july 28th and 31st, 2019, and also
between august 14th and 22nd, a small number of blood donor profiles were
subject to unauthorized access on our donor portal website: bloodhero.com. it
appears that an unauthorized person gained access to the donor profiles and,
despite password protection, was able to log in and attempt to use donor reward
points. in some cases, donor loyalty program points were fraudulently redeemed to
order gift cards from vitalant's hero rewards store.

one that is more secure. for donors that did not respond to the email request, we
deactivated the current password in order to safeguard the donor's account and
information until a new password is created by the donor. in addition, we restored all
fraudulently redeemed loyalty program points to the affected donor accounts. & the information stored in your donor profile includes your name, date of birth, blood
type, donor id number, gender, address, phone numbers (home, work and/or

example, whole blood, platelets or plasma);
â€¢ wellness information (blood pressure, pulse, cholesterol results, hemoglobin
level, temperature, height, weight and body mass index); and
â€¢ loyalty program points you may have earned and/or redeemed.	the information suggests that a person gained access to the donor profiles through unauthorized access and attempted to use donor reward points. this label is chosen because the website was hacked and the information was accessed through unauthorized means.

a desktop computer and an external hard drive had been st len from an on-campus
office. at that time, based on available information, uvm was unable to verify whether the
devices contained any personal information. monitoring triggers were put into place, which did
not indicate further activity on the devices; however, the investigation was closed.
between november 12, 2018 and november 19, 2018, the desktop was located; however,
the external hard drive remains missing. at that time, uvm contracted with external forensics
experts to assist. on june 12, 2019, the forensics team confirmed that (i) the desktop had not
been powered on since it went missing; and (ii) the desktop contained some files that may
contain personally identifiable information and it is likely that these same files are on the
external hard drive. most of the files that contained personally identifiable information were
emails or attachments to emails. on august 23, 2019, my office confirmed that a file on the
desktop contained your personally identifiable information. while the desktop had not been
accessed since it was stolen and while access to these emails requires a password, password
protection alone is not foolproof and someone with the right experience could likely gain access
to these :files. we are, therefore, providing you with this notice. & the file(s) that we identified as containing your personal information is/are:

choice recently learned of a technical issue that only occurred in a specific circumstance. the cause of
the issue has been addressed. the issue involved information entered by a visitor to choice's website
being inadvertently accessible to third parties, with whom choice has a business relationship, when the
visitor's web browser crashed while on the site. choice uses technology to track activities that occur on
its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to choice.
for visitors to choice's website who used the safari web browser, if safari crashed and restarted, safari
would put information that had been typed by the visitor on the page into the website address for that
page. tracking technology reads the website address of pages on choice's website and sends the data
to third parties. except in a safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information
entered by visitors. we believe this occurred because of how the code for safari was written.
this specific issue occurred approximately 88,000 times from june 201s through november 12, 2019.
choice identified the guest reservations involved that occurred since april 2016 and has sent emails to
those guests. we believe that this scenario occurred very infrequently from june 2015 - march 2016
(likely less than 25 times), but we do not have information available to identify the specific guests so we
are issuing a press release and posting this notice to notify those guests. & if a visitor to choice's website was using safari and on the reservation page, the information that had
been typed in fields on that page that could have been put in the website address when the browser
restarted after a crash may include the name of the person making the reservation, email address, state,
zip code, country code, and the number and expiration date of the payment card used to make the
reservation. we are notifying you because this scenario occurred when you were making a reservation.
if you were making a reservation using a mixture of points and payment, the external verification value
on the card may have also been in the website address.	the breach was due to a technical issue that made it possible for information typed by visitors of choice's website to be accessible to third parties in the event of a safari browser crash, with the information possibly including names, email addresses, state, zip codes, country codes, and credit card information with cvv numbers. the cause of the issue has already been addressed and choice has already sent emails to guests affected by the breach. however, due to lack of information, choice issued a press release and posted a notice for guests that they could not identify.

we recently concluded an investigation into an error that caused your wsecu account number
to appear on the deed for your home equity loan or home equity line of credit. after these
loans are opened, the deeds are recorded with the county in which the property resides and
then become public records. this means that your account number may be visible to individuals
who access the recorded deed on the county system. you may have more than one impacted
loan, depending on your borrowing history. & your wsecu account number ending in <<last four>> was printed on the deed. this number
does not include the full 12-digit account number associated with any check-writing privileges.
as a result, we believe the risk of fraud from this incident is very low; however, your account
number, in combination with other identifying information, could be used to initiate certain
account access.	the breach was caused by unintended disclosure of sensitive information not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss, as the account number was included on a public record by error.

we recently concluded an investigation into an error that caused your wsecu account number
to appear on the deed for your home equity loan or home equity line of credit. after these
loans are opened, the deeds are recorded with the county in which the property resides and
then become public records. this means that your account number may be visible to individuals
who access the recorded deed on the county system. you may have more than one impacted
loan, depending on your borrowing history. & your wsecu account number ending in <<last four>> was printed on the deed. this number
does not include the full 12-digit account number associated with any check-writing privileges.
as a result, we believe the risk of fraud from this incident is very low; however, your account
number, in combination with other identifying information, could be used to initiate certain
account access.	the breach was an unintended disclosure that did not involve hacking, intentional breach, or physical loss. the error caused the wsecu account number to appear on the publicly accessible recorded deed for the home equity loan or line of credit, and therefore the number may be visible to the individuals who access the recorded deed on the county system.

the issue has been addressed. the issue involved information entered by a visitor to choiceâ€™s website
being inadvertently accessible to third parties, with whom choice has a business relationship, when the
visitorâ€™s web browser crashed while on the site. choice uses technology to track activities that occur on
its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to choice.
for visitors to choiceâ€™s website who used the safari web browser, if safari crashed and restarted, safari

page. tracking technology reads the website address of pages on choiceâ€™s website and sends the data
to third parties. except in a safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information

payment card used to make the reservation. if the individual making the reservation was using a
mixture of points and payment, the external verification value on the card may have also been in
the website address.	based on the provided information, it seems that the information was inadvertently accessible to third parties with whom choice has a business relationship, when the visitor's web browser crashed while on the site. the cause of the issue was due to the safari web browser code, and not due to hacking, an insider threat, physical loss, or portable device loss.

email within our employee's email account.

access to an email account belonging to a tdc employee for an unknown period of time. upon first learning of the incident 
on august 9, 2019, we secured the employeeâ€™s email account, launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope 
of the incident, and engaged a computer security firm to assist. due to the nature of the unauthorized access to the account, 
we were unable to determine which specific emails or attachments, if any, may have been viewed by the unauthorized

policy number.	the breach was caused by phishing and unauthorized access of a dis employee's email account.
on or about may 8, 2019, we detected that the email account of an email administrator was accessed by
an unauthorized person. we immediately engaged leading data security firms to conduct a thorough
investigation, and we believe the unauthorized activity is attributable to phishing emails received in april
and may 2019. our investigation concluded that the incident implicated no systems beyond certain of the
company's email accounts and that the unauthorized person did not gain access to any account
management or online customer database or server or other intl fcstone systems.
as noted above, we were unable to determine whether any information about you was actually accessed ,
but we have also not been able to rule out that your information was affected by this incident. information
that might have been implicated includes your name, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's
license number, passport number, intl fcstone account number, and other information we collect or use
in the ordinary course of our business. & name, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, intl fcstone account number	the breach was caused by unauthorized access to an email account that was compromised after a phishing email in april and may of 2019.
phishing; name, address, dob, ssn, dln, passport number & on may 8, 2019, intl fcstone detected that the email account of an email administrator was accessed by an unauthorized person. we immediately engaged leading data security finns to conduct a thorough investigation, and we believe the unauthorized activity is attributable to phishing emails received in april and may 2019. working with these consultants, we successfully tenninated the unauthorized person's access to our system on may 14. the consultants concluded that the incident implicated no systems beyond certain of intl fcstone's email accounts and that the unauthorized person did not gain access to any account management or online customer database or server or other intl fcstone system. the investigation could not, however, conclusively rule out that information was accessed or removed from the affected email accounts. we thus immediately began working with a leading forensic film to analyze the scope of any implicated info1mation. this review and analysis took a substantial amount of time due to the unstructured nature and combined volume of items in the affected email accounts. given this, the forensic finn did not provide us their rep01i until late october, at which point we i1mnediately began our analysis of the forensic firm's findings, which included supplementing their analysis with residency information. we completed this analysis on december 6th, 2019. while, as noted above, we are unable to conclusively detennine whether any infonnation about the potentially implicated individuals was actually accessed or removed from the affected email accounts, we nonetheless decided, out of an abundance of caution, that it was approp1iate to notify them that their personal information may have been implicated by the incident. this personal infonnation may have included an individual's name, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, intl fcstone account number, and other infonnation we collect or use in the ordinary course of our business. at this time, all indications are that the unauthorized person has no fu1iher access to our email system. as always, we've been working with leading experts to enhance our security. we continue to monitor our systems for unauthorized access and have introduced additional security measures since the incident including, among other things, implementing multi-factor authentication for our email system. we have also coordinated with the federal bureau of investigation to investigate the incident.& an individual's name, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, intl fcstone account number, and other infonnation	the breach involved unauthorized access of an email account due to phishing emails, and potentially exposed personal information including an individual's name, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, intl fcstone account number, and other information. the investigation could not conclusively determine if information was accessed or removed from the affected email accounts.

evidence that your information was extracted from our systems or misused in any way. certain emails
within that email account contain sensitive or personal identifying information, but we cannot confirm
with certainly which emails within that email account were accessed or reviewed by the outside attacker,
if any. we are therefore providing notice to you of this attack out of an abundance of caution.& name, financial account number, date of birth, social security number, address, driverâ€™s license number,

it has come to our attention that, on rare occasions, users of shoprunner express checkout who were adding new payment card information and experienced some error (e.g., loss of internet connection) may have had their credit or debit card information appended to and transferred to the relevant retailer in url logs. when this did occur, the information in the urls was transmitted with encryption, which means it was not accessible to any third parties. however, our retail partners in some cases captured plain text urls of that information, which was then available in turn to their website vendors, such as ad technology and analytics companies.

& the information that could have been accessed as a result of that transmission consisted solely of your name, address, and credit or debit card information (number, expiration date and possibly cvv code, which is the three or four-digit number typically printed on the back of your card). we are not aware of and have no reason to believe there to have been improper use of any of this information.	the breach was an unintended disclosure of credit or debit card information that was captured in plain text urls and inadvertently transmitted to website vendors of shoprunner corporation's retail partners. the breach did not involve hacking or physical loss of data, and there is no evidence of any improper use of the information.

experienced an unauthorized connection by some unknown third party on june 6th, 2019. upon
discovery, magellanâ€™s information security team immediately took steps to protect the employeeâ€™s
email account and ensure no further unauthorized access. we undertook an extremely thorough
investigation of this incident in order to determine whether the unauthorized third party may have
actually accessed any of our employeeâ€™s emails. it is our belief that the unauthorized third party was
attempting to gain access to email accounts solely to send out large volumes of spam, and had no
intention to view or otherwise access the contents of any emails within the employeeâ€™s email account at
all. however, despite our best efforts, we are unable to definitively say that none of the emails that our
employee had in their email account were accessed. thus, while we have no evidence or reason to
believe that the hacker accessed any emails at all, out of an abundance of caution we are notifying you
of this incident because you are one of the individuals whose information was contained in at least one
email within our employeeâ€™s email account. & the employee whose email account was impacted interacted with providers to help resolve issues with
claims for their patients who were php plan members, so the emails which may have potentially been
accessed involved claims data including both member and provider information. since you use your
social security number (â€œssnâ€) as your taxpayer identification number (â€œtinâ€), unfortunately your ssn
was included in the claims data.	an unauthorized third party gained access to an employee's email account on june 6th, 2019. although it is believed that the hacker was attempting to send spam and did not access any emails, it cannot be definitively confirmed that no emails were accessed. the breach involved phi and pii, including name, ssn, tax id number, and claim information.

on december 2, 2019, rooster teeth discovered that malicious code had been added to the site 
earlier the same day. the malicious code directed users entering a checkout on the site to a 
spoofed webpage where they were asked to enter payment card details in order to complete their 
purchases. this was inserted after the stage at which users entered their shipping data. users 
who completed the payment card details page were then directed to the real webpage, where they 
were asked to complete the forms again. & if you entered information on the spoofed webpage described above, your name, email address, 
telephone number, physical address, and/or payment card information (including expiration dates 
and security codes) may have been exposed. you are receiving this notice because our records

the forensic evidence suggests that tripletree holdings was the target of this incident and the bad actor was seeking 
to defraud the firm by attempting to access emails that would facilitate financial fraud. we have no reason to believe 
that the attacker was looking for personal information and we do not know if any information was ever actually 
viewed or acquired by the attacker. 
& nevertheless, because the bad actor had temporary access to the email accounts, 
we searched for any personal information in the email accounts that could have been viewed. on december 1, 2019, 
we determined that one of the email accounts contained your social security number.	there is not enough information to definitively categorize this breach. while the attacker was attempting to access emails to facilitate financial fraud, it is unclear if any personal or sensitive information was actually acquired or viewed. additionally, there is no clear indication of how the attacker gained access, whether it was through hacking, a physical breach, or an insider.

insufficient information	there is not enough information provided to determine the type of breach.
unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, dob, dln & electel recently discovered that someone remotely accessed the email account of one of its
employees without authorization. upon learning of the incident, it promptly contained the
incident by securing the email account to prevent further access. the incident was limited to one
email account, which operates outside of and separate from electel's core bank system and
internal network, which were not affected.
at this point, electel is not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a result of
this incident, and does not know if any personal information was ever actually viewed or
acquired by the unauthorized party. nevertheless, as part of its investigation and out of an
abundance of caution, it searched for any personal information in the email account that could
have been viewed, and on november 20, 2019, it determined that the account contained the
personal information of some members. electel has been working to locate current addresses & personal information	based on the information provided, the breach resulted from unauthorized access to an email account and does not appear to involve hacking, physical loss, theft or portable devices. additionally, the breach is not confirmed to have resulted in any fraud or identity theft.
on december 3, 2019, v;e learned that an unauthorized code had been installed on evo.co1n. immediately upon
learning <if the issue, \ve launched an investigation and removed the unauthorized code. a leading cybersecurity firm 
was also engaged to assist. & during the customer checkout process, this unauthorized code could
have potentially captured information including: names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment card
number, expiration date, and card verification code.	the presence of an unauthorized code suggests that the outside party installed malware onto the website without authorization, making this a hacking incident. the potential capture of payment card information also suggests that this was likely a criminal act involving stolen credit card data, rather than unintentional or accidental disclosures.
landry's recently detected unauthorized access to the network that supports our payment processing systems for
restaurants and food and beverage outlets. we immediately launched an investigation, and a leading cybersecurity firm
was engaged to assist. although the investigation identified the operation of malware designed to access payment card
data from cards used in person on systems at our restaurants and food and beverage outlets, the end-to-end encryption
technology on point-of-sale terminals, which makes card data unreadable, was working as designed and prevented the
malware from accessing payment card data when cards were used on these encryption devices & the malware searched for track data (which sometimes has the cardholder name in addition to card number, expiration
date, and internal verification code) read from a payment card after it was swiped on the order-entry systems.	based on the information provided, there was unauthorized access to the payment processing system that supports the organization's restaurants and food outlets. the investigation revealed that malware was used to access payment card data from cards used in person on systems at their outlets.
we recently learned that an unauthorized individual may have obtained access to a limited number nbkc bank
employee email accounts bet\veen may 24, 2019 and august 11, 2019 & based on our comprehensive investigation and document review,
which concluded on december 20, 2019, we discovered that the compromised email account(s) contained your
full name and credit or debit card number.	the information indicates that an unauthorized individual accessed employee email accounts, leading to the compromise of credit or debit card numbers.
states logistics became aware of unusual activity within an employeeâ€™s email account. we
immediately began an investigation with the assistance of a third-party forensic investigator and reset relevant employee
passwords. the investigation determined that an unauthorized actor accessed one employee email account for a period
of approximately one hour on august 30, 2019. the investigation was unable to determine which, if any, emails and
attachments within the email account were accessed or viewed. therefore, we undertook a time-consuming review
of the email account to determine whether it contained any sensitive information. on december 2, 2019, our review
determined that some of your personal information was present in the email at the time of the incident. & the information related to you found within the email account includes your <<b2b_
text_1 data elements)>><<b2b_text_2 data elements)>>. to date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of
this information as a result of this incident.	the unauthorized access to the employee's email account was due to an outside actor, therefore classifying it as a hacked incident.
what happened? vivo recently learned of unusual activity related to an employee email account. upon learning of the
suspicious activity, we immediately took steps to secure the email account and began working with a computer forensic
investigation firm to determine the nature and scope of the incident. the investigation confirmed that the vivo employee
email account was accessed by an unknown actor from july 16, 2019 to august 6, 2019.
the investigation was unable to determine with forensic certainty what emails, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized
actor. in an abundance of caution, we worked with experts to perform a comprehensive review of all information stored in
the email account at the time of unauthorized access to confirm the identities of the individuals whose information may
have been accessible to the unauthorized actor. we then conducted a manual review of our records to determine the identities
and contact information for potentially impacted individuals.& what information was involved? on or about december 11, 2019, we determined the following types of information
relating to you were present in the email account, which may have been accessible to the unknown actor during this incident:
<<variable text>>. there is no evidence this information was misused by the unknown actor and vivo is providing this
notice in an abundance of caution.	the unauthorized actor accessed an employee email account from july 16, 2019 to august 6, 2019, and it was determined after a forensic investigation that it was a hacking incident. the investigation was unable to determine what information was accessed or whether it was misused.

states logistics became aware of unusual activity within an employee's email account. we immediately began an investigation with the assistance of a third-party forensic investigator and reset relevant employee passwords. the investigation determined that an unauthorized actor accessed one employee email account for a period of approximately one hour on august 30, 2019. the investigation was unable to determine which, if any, emails and attachments within the email account were accessed or viewed. therefore, we undertook a time-consuming review of the email account to determine whether it contained any sensitive information. on december 2, 2019, our review determined that some of your personal information was present in the email at the time of the incident.

baltimore, md 21202
idtheft@oag.state.md.us

re: amerisave mortgage corporation notification of security breach under md. code ann., com. law 14-3504(h).

dear attorney general frosh:

on behalf of amerisave mortgage corporation (amerisave), i write to advise of a cybersecurity incident affecting one of amerisaves accounts with a business partner.

incident summary. on november 1, 2019, one of amerisaves business partners informed amerisave of suspicious ip addresses accessing the business partners platform using amerisaves access credentials. immediately upon learning about this issue from the business partner, amerisave requested the list of suspicious ip addresses. upon review, amerisave determined that two of the ip addresses did not belong to amerisave or its employees, and the business partner promptly disabled access to the relevant account on november 4, 2019. at that time, it was unknown whether any consumer information had been compromised; as a result, amerisave immediately coordinated with the business partner to research this incident further. after conducting further research, on december 12, 2019, the business partner informed amerisave that certain amerisave consumer data may have been accessed from the suspicious ip addresses.

based on the information above, amerisave believes it is likely that an unauthorized third party may have gained access to customer loan records, stored on the business partners platform, which may have contained personal information (as that term is defined under maryland law). the records may have included names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, employment history, income information, mortgage loan information, information regarding assets and liabilities, and other consumer information; however, no passwords, security codes, access codes, or similar information were present in the potentially compromised data. based on a preliminary analysis of the business partner-provided activity logs, amerisave believes that the personal information including up to 70 maryland residents may have been improperly accessed. both the business partner and amerisave are continuing to investigate the cause of the unauthorized access and potential compromise of amerisaves account credentials.

amerisave has engaged buckley llp as external legal counsel and ankura as an incident response vendor to assist in resolving this issue and investigating the cause. amerisave is in the process of preparing notifications to affected consumers regarding this incident out of abundance of caution. though the investigation still is ongoing, amerisave is currently unaware of any misuse of the personal information of any maryland resident. however, if amerisave identifies any additional maryland residents whose personal information may have been accessed, we will so advise.

communicating with affected individuals. in compliance with maryland law, amerisave will send written notice by letter without unreasonable delay, which amerisaves estimates will be in early january 2020, to all currently identified customers whose personal information may have been accessible. a draft copy of the consumer notification is attached to this letter as exhibit a, which we may amend as we confirm the scope of the incident. the letter, among other things, advises the affected individuals to remain vigilant by reviewing their account statements. as amerisave completes its investigation, if it identifies any additional customers whose personal information may have been accessible, it will send written notification to them as well.

additional steps to protect consumers and enhance protections. on november 4, 2019, the business partner disabled amerisaves compromised account. amerisave is taking steps designed to prevent a similar incident from happening again, including resetting or changing of passwords of administrator accounts on an aggressive, periodic basis. amerisave is planning to offer 12 months of identity monitoring services to all maryland	the breach was caused by unauthorized access by a third party to amerisave's account with a business partner, potentially compromising customer loan records and personal information including names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, employment history, income information, mortgage loan information, information regarding assets and liabilities, and other consumer information of up to 70 maryland residents.
breach type: unauthorized access to email account | incident details: name ssn dob dln | | contents of data breach notification letter: unable to extract pdf text or no pdf available.	the description of the breach mentions "unauthorized access to email account", indicating that an outside party or malware was involved in gaining access to sensitive information (name, ssn, dob, and dln). the lack of a pdf or inability to extract text suggests that the breach was not a physical or unintentional disclosure, and there is no indication of involvement by an insider or portable device.
contents of data breach notification letter: dear <<first_name>> <<middle_name>> <<last_name>> <<suffix>>,

we are writing to inform you of an incident that involves portions of your information. alomere health understands the importance of protecting our patients' information.

on november 6, 2019, we learned that an unauthorized person(s) gained access to an alomere health employee's email account between october 31, 2019, and november 1, 2019. we immediately secured the account and began an investigation with a leading computer forensic firm hired to assist us. during the investigation, on november 10, 2019, we discovered unauthorized access to a second employee email account occurring on november 6, 2019. the investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized person(s) actually viewed any email or attachment in either account.

in an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails and attachments in the accounts to identify patients whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized person(s). from this review, we determined that portions of your information were contained in the email accounts. this information may have included your name, address, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, medical record number, health insurance information, treatment information, and/or diagnosis information.

while we have no confirmation that your information was actually viewed by the unauthorized person(s), or that it has been misused, we felt compelled to notify you of this incident and assure you that we take this very seriously.

as an act of goodwill, we are offering you a complimentary one-year membership of experian identityworkssm credit 3b. this product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. identityworks is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more information on identity theft prevention and identityworks, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, as well as information on additional steps you can take in response, please reference the additional information provided.

we also recommend that you review any statements that you receive from your healthcare providers or health insurer. if you see a service or services that you did not receive, please contact the provider or insurer immediately.

we regret this unauthorized action occurred and that it may cause inconvenience for you. to lessen the likelihood this occurs in the future, we have put in place additional security measures for all of alomere health employee email accounts. it is through these additional layers of security, staff training, and diligence that alomere health will continue to provide high-quality healthcare to you close to home with safety and security.

what information was involved?

on or about december 11, 2019, we determined the following types of information relating to you were present in the email account, which may have been accessible to the unknown actor during this incident: <<variable text>>. there is no evidence this information was misused by the unknown actor and vivo is providing this notice in an abundance of caution.

what we are doing.

re: notice of data security breach

dear all,

we take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. for this reason, we are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have allowed an unauthorized person to access some of your personal information.

what happened?

on [date], we were informed by three contractors about irregularities regarding their payroll processed on [date]. we immediately notified our online payroll service provider, netchex, which conducted an investigation. we use an administrative account to process payroll, and we access the account using an administrator username and password. netchex's investigation found that between november 3, 2019, and december 20, 2019, an unauthorized person accessed our administrative account by logging in with the valid username and password credentials.

what information was involved?

our administrative account has access to all demographic information stored with netchex, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, bank routing numbers, and other sensitive personal information. while we do not have evidence that the intruder actually accessed or acquired such information, it would have been possible.

what we are doing.

we immediately notified netchex, and their information security team swiftly launched an investigation into this matter. netchex helped us reset our administrative password and configure security features to help guard against this type of unauthorized access from happening again. at this time, we are not aware of any unauthorized access to our network or underlying systems or misuse of the potentially compromised information.

what you can do.

please regularly change your netchex account password, and do not share it with others. you should also remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitor your credit report for unauthorized activity. you may also consider placing a fraud alert or credit freeze with each of the three credit bureaus, which may be contacted here:

dear sir or madam:

we are writing on behalf of our client, sharma wasson & associates, inc. (swa), to notify you of a security incident involving one maryland resident. swa is a business consulting firm hired by organizations to provide tax and accounting services.

swa recently learned of a security incident when tax returns it attempted to file on behalf of a small number of clients were rejected as being previously filed. none of those clients are maryland residents.

upon first learning of the incident, swa took steps to investigate the potential incident and a computer security firm was engaged to assist. in the course of the investigation, swa	based on the information provided, it seems that there was unauthorized access to an email account of sharma wasson & associates inc., which resulted in the exposure of at least one maryland resident's personal information, including their name and social security number. the data breach does not appear to involve hacking or physical theft, but rather a disclosure resulting from unauthorized access to an email account.

fraud alerts: there are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one (1) year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. you can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies.

credit freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.

there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

the credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security freeze on your credit report. the credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (pin) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze.

to lift the security freeze to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a security freeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic means maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to the credit reporting agencies and include proper identification (name, address, and social security number) and the pin or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. the credit reporting agencies have one hour after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time.

other important information

security freeze

in some us states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. a security freeze (also known as a credit freeze) makes it harder for someone to open a new account in your name. it is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to apply for a new credit card, wireless phone, or any service that requires a credit check. you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement. there is no charge to request a security freeze or to remove a security freeze.	this appears to be an unintended disclosure of personal information to the wrong recipient via email.

we at bristol industries and its subsidiaries understand the importance of protecting the personal information in our possession. we are writing to inform you of a security incident that may have involved some of your information. this notice explains the incident, measures we have taken and some steps you can take in response.

our ongoing investigation into an email phishing incident recently determined that an unauthorized party could have accessed emails with potentially sensitive information in a limited number of bristol employee email accounts. upon learning of the potential access, we took steps to secure the email accounts and began an investigation with the assistance of a cybersecurity firm. our investigation determined that an unauthorized party accessed the accounts between march 23, 2019, and september 26, 2019. the investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized person. out of an abundance of caution, we conducted a comprehensive search for and review of the emails and attachments in the accounts and determined on december 16, 2019, that an email or attachment contained your <<b2b_text_1(impacted data)>>.

although, to date, we have no evidence that your information has been misused, we assure you that we take this incident very seriously. we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports for any unauthorized activity. for some additional steps you can take to help protect yourself, please see the additional information provided with this letter.

fraud alerts: there are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud - an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one (1) year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. you can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies.

credit freezes: you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.

there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

experian security freeze, po box 9554, allen, tx 75013, www.experian.com
transunion security freeze, po box 2000, chester, pa 19016, www.transunion.com
equifax security freeze, po box 105788, atlanta, ga 30348, www.equifax.com

to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. your full name (including middle initial as well as jr., sr., ii, iii, etc.)
2. social security number
3. date of birth
4. if you have moved in the past five years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years
5. proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill
6. a legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or id card, military identification, etc.)
7. if you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft

the credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security freeze on your credit report. the credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (pin) or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze.

to lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a security freeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic means maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to the credit reporting agencies and include proper identification (name, address, and social security number) and the pin or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze as well as the identity of those entities or individuals you would like to receive your credit report or the specific period of time you want the credit report available. the credit reporting agencies have one hour after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to lift the security freeze for those identified entities or for the specified period of time.

to remove the security freeze, you must submit a request through a toll-free telephone number, a secure electronic means maintained by a credit reporting agency, or by sending a written request via regular, certified, or overnight mail to each of the three credit bureaus and include proper identification (name, address, and social security number) and the pin number or password provided to you when you placed the security freeze. the credit bureaus have one hour after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to remove the security freeze.	the incident involved an email phishing scam that allowed an unauthorized party to access potentially sensitive information in employee email accounts, indicating that it was a hacking incident.

notice of data breach

dear [insert email address],

we are writing to inform you about a data breach that occurred on the website www.toondoo.com (toondoo).

the password used for your toondoo account has been compromised. if you have used the same password for other accounts, we strongly recommend that you change your password in those accounts as well.

what happened?

on november 11, 2019, we discovered that there was a data breach at toondoo.com. we immediately shut down the toondoo website.

what information was involved?

toondoo users' email addresses, usernames, passwords, and gender were compromised. in a few instances, the internet protocol (ip) address from which users signed up for a toondoo account and hence such users' geographic location, namely, city and u.s. state or country, as the case may be, were also compromised. toondoo did not have any credit card or other financial information, u.s. social security numbers, or other highly sensitive personal information.

what we are doing

as soon as we discovered that toondoo user information had been compromised, jambav, inc. immediately shut down the website. an independent forensics company will investigate the nature and extent of the breach.

we have filed a complaint with the u.s. federal bureau of investigation (fbi), are otherwise engaging with law enforcement authorities, and will cooperate and assist in any of their investigation activities.

what you can do

even though toondoo had no financial information, u.s. social security numbers, and other similarly highly sensitive personal information, we strongly recommend that you be proactive in protecting yourself from possible fraud, identity theft, or other illegal activity using your personal information. you can follow the recommendations in the next section to protect your personal information.

steps you can take to further protect your information

review your account statements and notify law enforcement of suspicious activity

as a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements and credit reports closely. if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. you also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your u.s. state attorney general, and/or the u.s. federal trade commission (ftc).

you may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major u.s. credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an annual credit report request form and mailing it to annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, georgia 30348. you can print this form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf. you also can contact one of the following three u.s. national credit reporting agencies:

fraud alert:

you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least 90 days. you can continue to renew your fraud alert. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three u.s. national credit reporting agencies identified above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

security freeze:

in some u.s. states, you have the right to put a security freeze on your credit file. this will prevent new credit from being opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. if you request a security freeze from a consumer reporting agency, there may be a fee up to $10 to place, lift, or remove the security freeze. in order to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the consumer reporting agency with information that identifies you, including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement.

additional free resources:

you can obtain information from the consumer reporting agencies, federal trade commission, or from your respective state attorney general about steps you can take toward preventing identity theft. you may report suspected identity theft to local law enforcement, including to the federal trade commission or to the attorney general in your state. residents of maryland, north carolina, and rhode island can obtain more information from their attorneys general using the contact information below.

review this additional information:

for oregon residents: you are advised to report any suspected identity theft to law enforcement, including the federal trade commission and the oregon attorney general.

for colorado, georgia, and new jersey residents: you may obtain one or more (depending on the state) additional copies of your credit report, free of charge. you must contact each of the credit bureaus directly to obtain such additional report(s).

annual credit report: you may also order a free annual credit report. to do so, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-887-322-8228. you can also order your free annual credit report by mailing a completed annual credit report request form (available from the u.s. federal trade commission's (ftc's) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) to: annual credit report request, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga 30348-5281.

security freeze: you have a right to place a security freeze on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. the security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. however, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. a security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.

to place a security freeze, you must send a written request to each of the three credit bureaus listed above and provide the following information: (1) your full name; (2) ssn; (3) date of birth; (4) the addresses where you have lived over the past 5 years; (5) proof of current address, such as a utility bill or telephone bill; (6) a copy of a government-issued identification card; (7) if you are the victim of identity theft, the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency; and (8) if you are not the victim of identity theft, payment by check, money order, or credit card.

fraud alert: as an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file. an initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. if you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years. a fraud alert indicates to any business requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a victim of fraud and requires the business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. a fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit, but it may cause some delay if you are applying for credit.

federal trade commission: visit the website for more information on how to protect yourself against identity theft and safeguarding your electronic devices from viruses and other malicious software by: learning how to make protecting yourself from identity thieves part of your daily routine by visiting consumer.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-idtheft (438-4338) to learn more about identity theft and protective steps you can take or file a report. you can also contact the ftc at: identity theft clearinghouse, federal trade commission, 600 pennsylvania avenue, n.w., washington,	the breach was caused by an outside party accessing information through phishing attack emails from the email accounts of two employees.

although, to date, we have no evidence that any of your information has been misused or was, in fact, viewed or accessed, out of an abundance of caution, we encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements for any unauthorized activity. as a precaution, we have arranged for you to receive a complimentary one-year membership to experian's identityworkssm credit monitoring service. this product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. identityworkssm is completely free to you, and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more information on identity theft prevention and identityworkssm, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, as well as some additional steps you can take in response, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

we immediately notified netchex, and their information security team swiftly launched an investigation into this matter. netchex helped us reset our administrative password and configure security features to help guard against this type of unauthorized access from happening again. at this time, we are not aware of any unauthorized access to our network or underlying systems or misuse of the potentially compromised information.

what you can do.

please regularly change your netchex account password and do not share it with others. you should also remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring your credit report for unauthorized activity. you may also consider placing a fraud alert or credit freeze with each of the three credit bureaus, which may be contacted here:

re: notification of a data security incident

dear mr. karberg:

we represent phoenix children's hospital (phoenix children's), in connection with an incident that involved the personal information of one (1) maryland resident, and we provide this notice on behalf of phoenix children's pursuant to md. code ann., com. law 14-3504(h). this notice will be supplemented, if necessary, with any new significant facts discovered subsequent to its submission. while phoenix children's is notifying you of this incident, phoenix children's does not waive any rights or defenses relating to the incident or this notice, or the applicability of maryland law on personal jurisdiction.

nature of the security breach or unauthorized use or access

phoenix children's recently determined that an unauthorized individual was able to remotely access the email accounts of seven (7) phoenix children's employees. upon its discovery of the incident, phoenix children's immediately took action, including securing the email account credentials and retaining a leading forensic security firm to investigate and confirm the overall security of its email and computer systems. on november 15, 2019, phoenix children's determined that the personal information that was in the impacted email accounts included the name and certain limited medical information of the maryland resident. at this point, phoenix children's is not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a result of this incident and cannot confirm if any personal information was actually obtained by an unauthorized party. nevertheless, because there was an email account compromise and phoenix children's cannot isolate exactly what, if any, information may have been obtained, phoenix children's is notifying all individuals whose personal information could have been accessed.

number of maryland residents affected

on january 14, 2020, phoenix children's determined that this incident impacted one (1) maryland resident. phoenix children's is mailing notification letters to the impacted individual on january 14-15, 2020. enclosed is a sample of the notice letter that is being sent to the impacted resident via first-class united states mail.

steps taken relating to the incident

upon learning of the incident, phoenix children's promptly secured the email accounts to prevent further access. multi-factor authentication had been enabled prior to this incident. phoenix children's also conducted a comprehensive search for any personal information in the impacted email accounts. finally, phoenix children's retained a leading forensic security firm to investigate and confirm the security of its email and computer systems.

the investigation determined that your name and extra 1 exposed element, extra 1 exposed element, extra 1 exposed element, extra 1 exposed element, extra 1 exposed element were stored within an impacted email account and are therefore potentially at risk for unauthorized access. at this time, decron is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information.

determined that an unknown actor gained access to two madison y employee email accounts for a limited time period
on october 18, 2019. during this limited timeframe, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain emails and
attachments within the account. while our investigation was able to confirm access to the accounts, the investigation

and to whom the information relates. on december 5, 2019, we completed the programmatic and manual review
and detennined that the email accounts contained some of your personal information. madison y then immediately
launched a review of its files to ascertain address information in order to provide notice to those individuals whose
infonnation was present in the accounts. &name

re: notification of security incident

to whom it may concern:

i am writing on behalf of hanna andersson, llc to inform you of a recent security incident involving hanna andersson's website. on december 5, 2019, law enforcement informed hanna andersson that credit cards used on its website were available for purchase on a dark web site. hanna andersson immediately launched an investigation. the investigation has confirmed that hanna andersson's third-party e-commerce platform, salesforce commerce cloud, was infected with malware that may have scraped information entered by customers into the platform during the purchase process. the earliest potential date of compromise identified by forensic investigators is september 16, 2019, and the malware was removed on november 11, 2019. although the investigation to date indicates that not all customers who made purchases through hanna andersson's website during that time period were affected, it has not been possible to determine which specific customers were impacted. as a result, hanna andersson determined on december 31 that it would notify all customers who made a purchase on its website during the relevant timeframe that they may have been impacted by this incident. this notification is being mailed to 1,200 residents of your state beginning january 15, 2020. as described in the notification, a copy of which is enclosed, the incident may have resulted in access to name, billing and shipping address, payment card number, cvv code, and expiration date. hanna andersson is cooperating with law enforcement and the payment card brands in their investigation of and response to the incident. it has taken steps to re-secure the online purchasing platform on its website and to further harden it against compromise, including increasing use of multi-factor authentication and enhanced system monitoring. please contact me if you have further questions.

on behalf of northerner scandinavia ab, located at mobelgatan 4, 43133 molndal, sweden and which owns northerner scandinavia inc., located at 6 state rd., mechanicsburg, pennsylvania 17050 (collectively, northerner), we are writing to inform you about a recent incident involving the potential exposure of some of your personal information on www.northerner.com (the northerner website).

what happened?

on december 9, 2019, we discovered that unauthorized script was placed on the checkout page of the northerner website. the unauthorized script potentially allowed the third party that placed the script to capture information submitted by customers on the checkout page of the northerner website if credit card data was entered and the place order button was hit. upon discovery of the incident, northerner immediately disabled the credit card payment function on the site and removed the unauthorized script. through our investigations, we discovered that the unauthorized script was likely placed on the website on or about november 30, 2019.

what information was involved?

the information potentially involved was limited to: first name; last name; street address; city; state; zip/postal code; country; phone number; email address; password (if this value was entered to create an account); payment card number; payment card security code; and payment card month/year of expiration if the values for these items were typed into the checkout page on the northerner website and the place order button was hit. the unauthorized script may have also captured web browser and operating system information.

what are we doing?

we immediately began an investigation as soon as we suspected a problem. we quickly contacted the federal bureau of investigation and brought in a leading forensics firm to assist in our investigation. in addition, we are also taking certain technical precautions in effort to prevent this type of incident from occurring again.

what you can do.

1. monitor account statements and free credit reports. you should remain vigilant for incidents of financial fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports.

2. change passwords. we recommend you change your password for any online accounts, including accounts with northerner and any other account on which you used the same or similar information used for your northerner account.

3. contact the federal trade commission, law enforcement and credit bureaus. you may contact the federal trade commission (ftc), your state's attorney general's office, or law enforcement, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. to learn more, you can go to the ftc's websites at www.identitytheft.gov and www.ftc.gov/idtheft; call the ftc at (877) idtheft (438-4338); or write to: ftc consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20580.

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam:

we represent madison area ymca (madison y), 111 kings road madison, nj 07940, and write to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of some personal information relating to three (3) maryland residents. the investigation into this event is ongoing and this notice will be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission. by providing this notice, madison y does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of maryland law, the applicability of the maryland data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

nature of the data event

on or about october 18, 2019, madison y learned of suspicious activity in a madison y employee's email account. upon learning of the activity, madison y immediately took steps to secure the employee's email account and launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the activity. with the assistance of third-party forensic experts, madison y determined that an unknown actor gained access to two madison y employee email accounts for a limited time period on october 18, 2019. during this limited timeframe, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain emails and attachments within the account. while the investigation was able to confirm access to the accounts, the investigation was unable to rule out access to any emails or attachments. as a result, with the assistance of third-party forensics, madison y began an extensive review of the email accounts to determine whether they contained any protected information and to whom the information relates. on december 5, 2019, madison y completed the programmatic and manual review and determined that the email accounts contained personal information. madison y then immediately launched a review of its files to ascertain address information in order to provide those individuals whose information was present in the accounts.

the types of personal information potentially impacted in relation to this incident include name and social security number. the impacted data elements were not the same for each affected individual.

notice to maryland residents

on january 15, 2020, madison y began mailing written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes three (3) maryland residents. written notice to the individuals is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon discovering this incident, madison y promptly began an investigation with the assistance of a third-party forensic investigator to determine the nature and scope of this incident, including identifying the individuals who may be affected, putting in place resources to assist them, and providing them with notice of this incident. while madison y is not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of the information, madison y is providing affected individuals access to twelve (12) months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services, through transunion. additionally, madison y is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements, to monitor free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

additional information about identity theft

regular monitoring of your credit report helps identify suspicious activity. under federal law, you are entitled to obtain one free copy of your credit report every twelve months from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies. you can obtain a free copy of your credit report from each agency by calling 1-877-322-8228 or visiting www.annualcreditreport.com. we recommend that you periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. if you discover fraudulent activity, you can contact your local law enforcement agency, the attorney general of your state, or the federal trade commission. you can also request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file.

you may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze. a fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. a security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts.

additional information about identity theft

regular monitoring of your credit report helps identify suspicious activity. under federal law, you are entitled to obtain one free copy of your credit report every twelve months from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies. you can obtain a free copy of your credit report from each agency by calling 1-877-322-8228 or visiting www.annualcreditreport.com. we recommend that you periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. if you discover fraudulent activity, you can contact your local law enforcement agency, the attorney general of your state, or the federal trade commission. you can also request that the credit reporting agency delete that information from your credit report file.

you may also consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze. a fraud alert will notify any merchant checking your credit history that you may be the victim of identity theft and that the merchant should take additional measures to verify the application. contacting any one of the three agencies will place an alert on your file at all three. a security freeze restricts all creditor access to your account but might also delay any requests you might make for new accounts.

client address

dear client:

we are writing to inform you about a recent incident at william blair & company, l.l.c. (william blair). in january 2020, a 2019 year-end account statement containing certain client information pertaining to your account was mailed to the wrong address. the inadvertently disclosed client information contained the full name on your account and account number. the information did not contain date of birth, social security number or address.

this incident happened because a client requested an address update for their account but your account was accidentally updated since the account number was 1 digit different than yours. it was purely an isolated human error. the same day the client received the statement he contacted us and confirmed he had destroyed the document without retaining a copy.

out of an abundance of caution, we are placing heightened scrutiny of any requested money or security movements from your accounts. if you would like us to change your account number on any affected account, please let us know. we do not believe that you would need to complete any additional paperwork in order to change the account number on your accounts.

while the information was received by a long-term partner and client of the firm (and subsequently destroyed), it is always prudent to monitor activity in your accounts. below is a checklist of suggestions to further protect your information:

1. review your bank, credit card, debit card and other financial account statements over the next twelve to twenty-four months and immediately report any suspicious activity.

2. monitor your credit reports with the major credit reporting agencies.

accounts you did not open.

inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate.

inaccurate personal information, such as home address and social security number.

3. if you do find suspicious activity on your credit reports or other account statements, call your local police or sheriff's office and file a report of identity theft. get a copy of the police report. you may need to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up your records, and also to access some services that are free to identity theft victims.

4. if you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or on your other account statements, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit files so creditors will contact you before opening new accounts. call any of the three credit reporting agencies at the number below to place fraud alerts with all three agencies.

by providing this notice, calibre does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of washington law, the applicability of the washington data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

calibre's investigation, as described in our prior notice, reviewing of the contents of the impacted source documents, the types of protected information contained in the documents, and to which individuals the information relates, continued following the initial notice. calibre continued a lengthy review of its files to ascertain address information for the impacted individuals. this included continued	based on the provided information, there is no clear indication of how the data was breached. the letter is a notice of a supplemental notice of data security incident, but there is no mention of how the data was compromised, suggesting this is an unintended and undisclosed disclosure not involving hacking, an intentional breach or physical loss.

we recently concluded an investigation and analysis of a data security incident involving unauthorized
access to three employee email accounts that contained personal information. upon learning of the
incident, we immediately took steps to secure the email accounts, launched an investigation, and engaged
a cybersecurity firm to assist. findings from our investigation indicate that an unauthorized individual
gained access to those employee email accounts at various times between june 25, 2019, and september
8, 2019. & on december 10,
2019, after extensive review of the email contents, the investigation determined that the personal
information of one maryland resident was in the account, including the individualâ€™s name and
credit or debit card number in conjunction with security information.	the breach involved unauthorized access to employee email accounts by an outside party, indicating hacking as the type of breach.

password or pin, credit card number or debit card number in combination with any required security code, 
access code or password that would permit access to your financial accounts; email address and password;

unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, dln & viking partners recently discovered that someone remotely accessed the email account of one of 
its employees without authorization. upon learning of the incident, it promptly contained the 
incident by securing the email account to prevent further access. the incident was limited to one 
email account, which operates outside of and separate from viking partnersâ€™ internal network, 
which was not affected. 
at this point, viking partners is not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a 
result of this incident, and does not know if any personal information was ever actually viewed 
or acquired by the unauthorized party. &nevertheless, as part of its investigation and out of an 
abundance of caution, it searched for any personal information in the email account that could 
have been viewed, and on november 6, 2019, it determined that the account contained the 
personal information of some individuals, including their name, social security number and/or 
driverâ€™s license number.	although the data breach was a result of unauthorized access to an email account, there is no evidence that hacking or physical loss occurred. additionally, the personal information was unintentionally disclosed without the involvement of an insider, and there is little information available to confirm if the incident was intentional or unintentional. therefore, the breach can be classified as a "disc" type of breach.
unauthorized access to email account; name, ssn, dln & we value and respect the privacy of your information and take protecting your privacy seriously. 
unfortunately, we are writing to notify you of a data security incident that may have involved 
some of your personal information. we learned that a phishing email was sent from one of 
our employeeâ€™s email accounts. upon learning of the incident, we promptly secured the email 
account and retained a leading forensic security firm to investigate and confirm the security of 
our email and computer systems. & the forensic investigation did not see evidence of any personal information having been 
acquired, but we could not rule out the possibility that someone accessed information while 
they were in the email account. as such, we searched the entire account for any personal 
information that was contained therein. on november 6, 2019, our investigation determined 
that the employeeâ€™s email account contained some of your personal information, including your 
name, driverâ€™s license number and social security number or ein, and for some people date 
of birth and/or address	the unauthorized access to the employee's email account indicates that an outside party hacked into the system. the fact that a phishing email was sent is further evidence of this. in addition, the hiring of a forensic security firm confirms that the company suspects a hack.

notice of data breach

dear [recipient]:

we are writing to inform you that we recently identified and addressed a security incident that may have involved some of your information. this letter explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

what happened

we recently concluded an investigation and analysis of a data security incident involving unauthorized access to three employee email accounts that contained personal information. upon learning of the incident, we immediately took steps to secure the email accounts, launched an investigation, and engaged a cybersecurity firm to assist. findings from our investigation indicate that an unauthorized individual gained access to those employee email accounts at various times between june 25, 2019, and september 8, 2019.

what information was involved

based on the investigation, we have confirmed that an unauthorized third party gained access to the information in that employee's email account, and consequently, gained access to your personal information, including possibly your name; date of birth; financial account number; financial account password or pin, credit card number or debit card number in combination with any required security code, access code or password that would permit access to your financial accounts; email address and password; username and password, or protected health information.

what we are doing

securing individuals' information is a top priority and we have worked swiftly to address this issue. to help prevent a similar incident in the future, we are taking steps to enhance our existing security protocols and re-educating our staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

what you can do

re: incident notification

dear attorney general frosh:

we are writing on behalf of our client, honeybee health (honeybee), to notify you of a security incident involving maryland residents. honeybee health is an online pharmacy that verifies, fills, and mails prescription medications to individuals across the united states.

on november 19, 2019, honeybee learned that a small number of its customers experienced unauthorized charges on their payment card after they used the card to make a purchase at honeybeehealth.com (the website). honeybee immediately launched an internal investigation, and a leading computer forensic firm was hired to assist. the investigation identified that unauthorized code was added to the websites checkout page on november 16. the code was removed from the website as soon as it was found on november 19. on november 28, honeybee was reviewing the website code and discovered that the unauthorized code had re-appeared. the script was again removed the same day. shortly thereafter, on december 2, honeybee found a similar script on the website. the code was removed and honeybee moved the affected server behind additional protective security layers. the unauthorized code was designed to copy information entered during checkout and send the information to an unauthorized person. that information included the name, billing and shipping address, and payment card number, expiration date, and security code (cvv) of certain honeybee customers that made a purchase between november 16-19, november 23-29, and on december 2, 2019. if the customer also provided the name of other medications he or she is taking, medical conditions that he or she may have, or the name and contact information of his or her provider, that information may have also been obtained by the unauthorized person. the code did not copy order information that was not typed into a text field during the checkout process.

on january 17, 2020, pursuant to md. code ann., com. law 14-3504, honeybee will begin mailing notification letters via u.s. first-class mail to 15 maryland residents in substantially the same form as the enclosed letter. in addition, honeybee has established a dedicated call center where individuals may obtain more information regarding the incident.

to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, honeybee is taking steps to enhance its security environment, including moving the server behind additional protective security layers and scanning its website for malicious code.

please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

sincerely,

honeybee health understands the importance of protecting our customers' information. regrettably, we are writing to inform you of an incident that involves some of your information. this notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.

on november 19, 2019, we learned that a small number of our customers experienced unauthorized charges on their payment card after they used the card to make a purchase at honeybeehealth.com (the website). we immediately launched an internal investigation, and a leading computer forensic firm was hired to assist. the investigation identified that unauthorized code was added to the checkout page on the website on november 16, 2019. the code was removed from the website as soon as it was found on november 19, 2019. the code was designed to copy information entered during checkout and send the information to an unauthorized person. that information may have included your name, billing and shipping address, and payment card number, expiration date, and security code (cvv) for the card you used to make a purchase on the website between november 16, 2019 and november 19, 2019. if during that purchase you provided the name of other medications you are taking, medical conditions you have, or the name and contact information for your provider, that information may have also been obtained by an unauthorized person. the code did not copy order information that was not typed in during the checkout process.

although this incident only involved a limited number of honeybee customers, we want to remind you to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements for any unauthorized activity. immediately report any unauthorized charges to your financial institution because the payment card network rules generally restrict cardholder	the data breach was the result of the unauthorized code added to the checkout page of the honeybee health website, designed to copy information entered during checkout and send it to an unauthorized person. this type of breach involving unauthorized code is typically categorized as hack.
breach type: inadvertent disclosure | incident details: name group number member id dental benefit info | | contents of data breach notification letter: unable to extract pdf text or no pdf available.	the incident details suggest that there was an unintended disclosure of dental benefit information, which does not involve hacking, intentional breach, physical loss, portable device, stationary computer loss, insider activity, or card fraud, making it a "disc" type of breach. the lack of information in the notification letter also supports the determination that this breach type is unknown.
breach type: malicious code | incident details: name payment card info | | contents of data breach notification letter: unable to extract pdf text or no pdf available.	the breach involved malicious code, indicating that an outside party gained unauthorized access to the system. the incident details mention payment card information, suggesting that the breach involved debit or credit cards. the lack of information in the data breach notification letter about the nature of the breach further indicates that this was a hack.

dear [name],

we are writing to notify you of a recent incident that may affect the security of your personal information. this letter will provide you with information concerning the event, measures we have taken since discovering the incident, and suggestions on how to protect your personal information.

what happened?

nea recently became aware of suspicious activity related to an employee email account. we immediately blocked further access to the affected account, and conducted an investigation to determine the reason for the suspicious activity. with the assistance of forensics experts, we determined that the employee's account was accessed without authorization from november 13-15, 2019.

upon learning this information, we performed a comprehensive review of the affected email account to determine whether it contained any personal information. this review found that the compromised email account held documents containing the full names and social security numbers of some individuals. while we are unable to determine whether any bad actors viewed this information, it was potentially accessible at the time of the incident. because your information was present in the compromised email account, we are notifying you in an abundance of caution so that you can take appropriate steps to protect your personal information.

what information was involved?

we cannot confirm whether any information was viewed by the unauthorized individual(s). however, nea's investigation confirmed that information present in the account at the time of the incident included your full name and social security number.

what we are doing.

nea values your privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred. we have security measures in place that allowed us to quickly identify and contain this incident, and we continue to confirm and strengthen the security of our systems. we have also provided relevant regulatory notices.

we are notifying potentially affected individuals, including you, so that you can take further steps to protect your information. to assist you in doing so, we have secured the services of cyberscout to provide identity monitoring services at no cost to you for 18 months. to learn more about these services, including how to sign up, please review the enclosed steps you can take to protect against identity theft and fraud.

what you can do.

please review the enclosed steps you can take to protect against identity theft and fraud. this document contains instructions on how to activate the free identity monitoring services we are making available to you, as we are unable to activate those services on your behalf. it also provides information on additional steps you can take to protect your personal information, including contact information for regulators and credit reporting agencies that may be able to provide assistance.

review your account statements and notify law enforcement of suspicious activity.

we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your account statements. if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. you also should promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidence of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, your state attorney general, and/or the federal trade commission. to file a complaint with the ftc, go to www.identitytheft.gov, or call 1-877-id-theft (1-877-438-4338); tty: 1-866-653-4261. complaints filed with the ftc will be added to the ftc's identity theft data clearinghouse, which is a database made available to law enforcement agencies.

monitor your free credit reports.

you should also remain vigilant about monitoring your credit report. you may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies once every 12 months by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228, or by completing an annual credit report request form and mailing it to annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga 30348.

contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies is provided below:

equifax (888) 766-0008 www.equifax.com p.o. box 740241 atlanta, ga 30374

experian (888) 397-3742 www.experian.com p.o. box 2002 allen, tx 75013

transunion (800) 680-7289 www.transunion.com p.o. box 2000 chester, pa 19106

place a fraud alert and/or security freeze.

we recommend placing a fraud alert on your credit report. a fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. the initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year, and you can renew it after one year. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any one of the three credit reporting agencies listed above. as soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. you may also want to consider placing a security freeze on your credit report, which will prevent potential creditors from obtaining your credit report. that makes it less likely that an identify thief can open new accounts in your name. however, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit. should you wish to place a security freeze, please contact each of the major consumer reporting agencies listed above.

file your taxes early.

file your taxes before a scammer can. tax identity theft happens when someone uses your social security number to get a tax refund or a job. respond right away to letters from the irs.

be alert for telephone scams.

do not believe anyone who calls and says you will be arrested unless you pay for taxes or debt even if they have part or all of your social security number, or they say they are from the irs.

further educate yourself on avoiding identity theft.

you can further educate yourself regarding identity theft, fraud alerts, security freezes, and the steps you can take to protect yourself, by contacting the consumer reporting agencies, the federal trade commission, the internal revenue service, or your state attorney general. for example, you may wish to review identity theft: a recovery plan, a comprehensive guide from the ftc to help you guard against and deal with identity theft, along with other tips provided by the federal trade commission on how to avoid identity theft. for more information, please visit www.identitytheft.gov, or call 1-877-id-theft (1-877-438-4338); tty: 1-866-653-4261. the irs also has guidance concerning identify protection at https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams.	an employee email account was accessed without authorization from november 13-15, 2019, and upon reviewing the email account, documents containing the full names and social security numbers of some individuals were found.

nature of the data event

on october 1, 2019, rs&f became aware that there was potential unauthorized access to an employee's email account as a result of a phishing scam. rs&f launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the event and brought in third-party experts to assist with the investigation. further, rs&f immediately took steps to secure the employee's email account, including resetting the password. the investigation has been ongoing and has included a diligent review of the impacted employee's email account contents to confirm the nature and scope of the incident.

on october 18, 2019, rs&f's investigation confirmed that there was unauthorized access to one employee email account from september 30, 2019, to october 1, 2019. rs&f is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of personal information as a result of this incident. out of an abundance of caution, rs&f undertook a programmatic and manual review to confirm what data may have been present in the employee's account and to whom that information relates. on or about november 6, 2019, after a thorough review process, rs&f determined that certain personal information was accessible within the impacted email account. the personal information accessible within the account includes: social security number, medical information, driver's license information, and financial account information.

notice to maryland residents

on january 22, 2020, rs&f began mailing written notice of this incident to impacted individuals, including approximately three hundred fifty-nine (359) maryland residents. written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon discovering this incident, rs&f began an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the event, including identifying the individuals who may be affected, putting in place resources to assist them, and providing them with notice of this incident. rs&f took immediate steps to respond to the incident and to protect the employee's email account by resetting the user's passwords. rs&f is also providing potentially affected individuals access to 12 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services. additionally, rs&f is providing potentially impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

re: incident notification

dear sir or madam:

we are writing on behalf of our client, environmental stoneworks, llc (esw), to provide notice of a security incident. esw's ongoing investigation into an email phishing incident recently determined that an unauthorized party could have accessed personal information in some esw employees' email accounts. upon learning of the incident, esw immediately took steps to secure the accounts, launched an investigation, and a cybersecurity firm was engaged to assist.

esw's investigation determined that an unauthorized person obtained access to the email accounts at various times between july 18, 2019, and december 10, 2019. the investigation was not able to determine which emails or attachments, if any, were accessed by the unauthorized person. out of an abundance of caution, esw conducted a thorough review of the emails and attachments that may have been accessed and, on december 23, 2019, determined that the emails or attachments contained the name of one maryland resident in combination with a social security number.

today, esw will begin sending notification letters via first class mail to the maryland resident whose personal information was contained in the accessed email accounts. this notice is being provided in accordance with md. code ann., com. law 14-3504. enclosed is a sample copy of the letter.

esw is offering one year of complimentary credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft protection services through kroll to the individuals whose social security number or driver's license number were contained in the accessed accounts. esw is also providing a call center for the individuals to call with questions regarding the incident.

to help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, esw is re-educating employees regarding phishing emails and enhancing existing security measures.

please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

sincerely,

on january 13, 2020, an email was inadvertently sent to the personal emails of seven company employees. the email included an attachment containing the personal information of certain company employees, including name, address, social security number, and employee identification number. while the data was separated in a second tab that was not readily apparent when the spreadsheet was opened, it could be viewed by the seven individuals if they switched tabs.

upon discovery of this error, the company immediately attempted to retrieve the email, but, because it was sent outside of the company's network, this was not possible. accordingly, the company quickly contacted each of the seven employees to demand that they delete the email and its attachment in its entirety from all electronic and physical locations (including deleted items folders), as well as from any media to which it may be saved. additionally, in an abundance of caution, the employees were required to sign a certification attesting to the destruction of the email and its attachment.

this week, the company will send a letter to each affected person informing them of this incident. the form of the notification letter to be sent to the affected person in maryland is enclosed.

order your free credit report.

to order your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the annual credit report request form on the u.s. federal trade commission's (ftc) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov and mail it to annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga 30348-5281. the three consumer reporting agencies provide free annual credit reports only through their websites, toll-free numbers, or request forms.

when you receive your credit report, review it carefully. look for accounts you did not open. look in the inquiries section for names of creditors from whom you haven't requested credit. some companies bill under names other than their store or commercial names. the consumer reporting agency will be able to tell you when that is the case. look in the personal information section for any inaccuracies in your information (such as home address and social security number). if you see anything you do not understand, call the consumer reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. errors in this information may be a warning sign of possible identity theft. you should notify the consumer reporting agencies of any inaccuracies in your report, whether due to error or fraud, as soon as possible so the information can be investigated and, if found to be in error, corrected. if there are accounts or charges you did not authorize, immediately notify the appropriate consumer reporting agency by telephone and in writing. consumer reporting agency staff will review your report with you. if the information can't be explained, then you will need to call the creditors involved. information that can't be explained also should be reported to your local police or sheriff's office because it may signal criminal activity.

report incidents.

if you detect any unauthorized transactions in a financial account, promptly notify your payment card company or financial institution. if you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud, promptly report the incident to law enforcement, the ftc, and your state attorney general. if you believe your identity has been stolen, the ftc recommends that you take these steps: close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently. for streamlined checklists and sample letters to help guide you through the recovery process, please visit https://www.identitytheft.gov/. file a local police report. obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors and any others that may require proof of the identity theft crime.

consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file.

to protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. a fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name. when a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be the victim of identity theft. the alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant. you can place a fraud alert on your credit report by calling any one of the toll-free numbers provided below. you will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three consumer reporting agencies. for more information on fraud alerts, you also may contact the ftc as described above.

on october 3, 2019, stow became aware of suspicious activity in certain employee email accounts. we immediately launched an investigation to determine the full scope and cause of the email activity and what information may have been affected. with the assistance of third-party forensic investigators, we learned that certain stow employee email accounts were accessed without authorization between august 25, 2019, and september 3, 2019, and september 16, 2019, and october 3, 2019.

unfortunately, the investigators were unable to confirm what, if any, emails and attachments within these accounts were subject to unauthorized access. therefore, working with third-party experts, we undertook a lengthy review of the email accounts to determine if they contained personal information and received a data file of potentially impacted individuals on december 2, 2019. however, this data file lacked complete address information related to individuals and required additional internal work to de-duplicate and update. we then commenced a review of this data file to add the missing address information and remove duplicate entries. following this additional review, we determined that information related to you was accessible in the email accounts during the period of potential compromise. we are unable to confirm if the email or attachment hosting your information was subject to unauthorized access.

what information was involved?

stow cannot confirm what emails and attachments, if any, were viewed by the unauthorized actor. however, stow's investigation confirmed the information about you present in the email accounts at the time of the incident includes your <<b2b_text_1(impacteddata)>>.

what we are doing.

information privacy and security are among our highest priorities. stow has strict security measures in place to safeguard information in our care. upon learning of this incident, stow took steps to confirm and further strengthen the security of our systems, including our employee email accounts. stow reset passwords for the impacted stow email accounts and is currently reviewing our policies and procedures relating to data security.

while we have no evidence of actual misuse of your personal information, we secured the services of kroll to provide identity monitoring services at no cost to you for one (1) year. information on how to activate these services may be found in the enclosed steps you can take to help protect against identity theft and fraud.

notice of data breach

the city of los banos takes the privacy and protection of personal information seriously. we are committed to notifying individuals if we believe the security or privacy of their information may have been compromised. we are writing to inform you of a recent data security incident that may have involved some of your personal information.

we recently learned that a city-owned laptop containing personal information was stolen from an employee's vehicle. while the laptop was password protected, its contents were unencrypted, and therefore it is possible that someone would be able to remove the data from the hard drive. we think this is unlikely, but wanted to notify you of the incident nonetheless.

upon discovering the incident, the city launched an investigation and recreated the contents of the laptop. the data that would have been on the laptop was then reviewed to identify individuals whose personal information may have been contained in those files. on december 14, 2019, we determined that some of your personal information was stored on the laptop.

at this point, we are not aware of any fraud or identity theft to any individual as a result of this incident, and do not know if any personal information was ever actually viewed or acquired by the unauthorized party. although we are not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft, we are offering a complimentary one-year membership of experian identityworkssm credit 3b. this product helps detect possible misuse of your personal information and provides you with identity protection services focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. identityworks credit 3b is completely free to you and enrolling in this program will not hurt your credit score. for more information on identity theft prevention and identityworks credit 3b, including instructions on how to activate your complimentary one-year membership, please see the additional information provided in this letter.

as part of our investigation, we searched for any personal information that could have been viewed. the impacted information for each individual differs but included your name and social security number. the information also may have included your driver's license number and, for a small number of individuals, could have included one or more of the following: passport number, financial information such as account or credit/debit number, username and password, and biometric and/or medical information.

as a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by, among other things, reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. you should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the federal trade commission (ftc).

you may wish to review the tips provided by the ftc on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes and steps to you can take to avoid identity theft. for more information and to contact the ftc, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-id-theft (1-877-438-4338). you may also contact the ftc at: federal trade commission, 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20580.

dear [name of person]:

we are writing to inform you of a recent security incident at deaf services unlimited. this notification is sent pursuant to the montana data breach notification statute (montana code 2-6-1501).

between january 13, 2020 and january 24, 2020, deaf services unlimited experienced an email phishing scam which resulted in a breach of our email system. the data accessed may have included personal information such as name, email address, mailing address, social security number, and bank account information.

to protect yourself from the possibility of identity theft, we recommend that you immediately place a fraud alert on your credit files. a fraud alert conveys a special message to anyone requesting your credit report that you suspect you were a victim of fraud. when you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, the lender should take measures to verify that you have authorized the request. a fraud alert should not stop you from using your existing credit cards or other accounts, but it may slow down your ability to get new credit. an initial fraud alert is valid for ninety (90) days. to place a fraud alert on your credit reports, contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies at the appropriate number listed below or via their website. one agency will notify the other two on your behalf. you will then receive letters from the agencies with instructions on how to obtain a free copy of your credit report from each.

equifax (888)766-0008 or www.fraudalert.equifax.com
experian (888) 397-3742 or www.experian.com
transunion (800) 680-7289 or www.transunion.com

you may also consider placing a security freeze on their credit reports. a security freeze prevents most potential creditors from viewing your credit reports and therefore, further restricts the opening of unauthorized accounts. for more information on placing a security freeze on your credit reports, please go to the montana attorney general website at https://dojmt.gov/consumer/identity-theft/.

when you receive a credit report from each agency, review the reports carefully. look for accounts you did not open, inquiries from creditors that you did not initiate, and confirm that your personal information, such as home address and social security number, is accurate. if you see anything you do not understand or recognize, call the credit reporting agency at the telephone number on the report. you should also call your local police department and file a report of identity theft. get and keep a copy of the police report because you may need to give copies to creditors to clear up your records or to access transaction records.

even if you do not find signs of fraud on your credit reports, we recommend that you remain vigilant in reviewing your credit reports from the three major credit reporting agencies. you may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com, calling toll-free 877-322-8228 or by completing an annual credit request form at: www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/credit/rights.shtm and mailing to: annual credit report request service, p.o. box 1025281 atlanta, ga 30348-5283

for more information on identity theft, you can visit the following websites:

montana attorney general website at: https://dojmt.gov/consumer/identity-theft/

dear valued client,

we value your business and respect the privacy of your information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may involve your personal information.

on january 16, 2020, a hacking organization called maze ransomware infiltrated the central data server of our law firm, encrypted all of the files on the server, and made a demand for $150,000.00 in exchange for the decryption codes. at this time, despite reasonable efforts and the employment of a specialist, we are unable to ascertain the extent to which maze may have actually extracted any personal data from any of our clients' files.

if maze actually extracted data from our server, we must inform you that the following information may have been compromised: full names, mailing addresses, bank account numbers, social security numbers, dates of birth, phone numbers, drivers license numbers, medical/health insurance information, and any other sensitive information you may have provided our office during the course of your case with us. fortunately, we do not store client billing information on our central server and, to our knowledge, none of our client billing or accounting information was accessed or disturbed.

how to enroll in credit monitoring:

we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online three-bureau credit monitoring service (mytrueidentity) for two years provided by transunion interactive, a subsidiary of transunion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies.

to enroll in this service, go to the mytrueidentity website at www.mytrueidentity.com and enter the following unique 12-letter activation code in the space referenced as "enter activation code." follow the three steps to receive your credit monitoring service online within minutes.

if you do not have access to the internet and wish to enroll in a similar offline, paper-based credit monitoring service via u.s. mail delivery, please call the transunion fraud response services toll-free hotline at 1-855-288-5422. when prompted, enter the following 6-digit telephone passcode and follow the steps to enroll in the offline credit monitoring service, add an initial fraud alert to your credit file, or speak to a transunion representative if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft.

once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain two years of unlimited access to your transunion credit report and credit score. the three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at transunion, experian, and equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address, and more. the service also includes access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

you can sign up for the online or offline credit monitoring service anytime between now and may 31, 2020. due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. please note that credit monitoring services might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with transunion, experian, or equifax, or an address in the united states (or its territories) and a valid social security number. enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

special note for minors affected by this incident:

the same services referred to above may not be available to affected minors. as an alternative, parents/legal guardians can check to see if your child may be a victim of identity theft by using transunion's secure online form at www.transunion.com/childidentitytheft to submit your information so transunion can check their database for a credit file with your child's social security number. after transunion's search is complete, they will respond to you at the email address you provide. if they locate a file in your child's name, they will ask you for additional information to proceed with steps to protect your child from any impact associated with this fraudulent activity.

additional resources:

you should remain vigilant for instances of fraud or identity theft over the next 12 to 24 months by reviewing your account statements and closely monitoring your credit reports, which are available to you free of charge.

annual credit report: you may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. to order your free annual credit report, please visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you can also order your free annual credit report by mailing a completed annual credit report request form (available from the u.s. federal trade commission's (ftc) website at www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) to: annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga 30348-5281.

for colorado, georgia, maine, maryland, massachusetts, new jersey, puerto rico, and vermont residents: you may obtain one or more (depending on the state) additional copies of your credit report, free of charge. you must contact each of the credit reporting agencies directly to obtain such additional report(s).

fraud alert: you may place a fraud alert in your file by contacting one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you before they open any new accounts or make certain changes to your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit.

security freeze: you have the ability to place a security freeze on your credit report. a security freeze will prevent a credit reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit report without your consent. as a result, using a security freeze may interfere with or delay your ability to obtain credit. you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file with each credit reporting agency. to place a security freeze, you may be required to provide the credit reporting agency certain identifying information, including your full name, social security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, a copy of your state-issued identification card, and a recent utility bill, bank statement, or insurance statement. under the economic growth, regulatory relief, and consumer protection act, you have the right to place a security freeze on your account free of charge.

bureau contact information: you may contact the three nationwide credit reporting agencies about security freezes, fraud alerts, and other related topics, using the following:

compromised due to criminal activity impacting a small number of the bank's atms. the precise time period
during which the incident occurred is still under investigation, but initial evidence indicates that the criminal
activity may have commenced in mid-november 2019 and ended no later than january 14, 2020. during this
time, our investigation has determined that these criminal actors accessed the personal information of a limited
number of customers. we sincerely apologize for this incident and for any concern this matter may cause you. & what information was involved?
the information that was accessed may have included your debit card number, the debit card expiration date,
the debit card cvv security code, your personal identifier number (pin), and the name associated with the debit
card. based upon our investigation to date, none of your other personal information-including your social
security number, driver's license number, etc.-was compromised during this incident.	the breach involved compromised debit card information, which was used for fraudulent atm transactions. it was not a hack or an insider attack, and there is no indication that any physical documents were lost or stolen. it also does not involve any unintentional disclosure or portable device, making it a card breach.

what happened
on december 7, 2019, bst learned that part of our network was infected with a virus that prohibited access to our
files. we quickly restored our systems and engaged an industry-leading forensic investigation firm to determine
the nature and scope of this incident. after a thorough analysis of all available forensic evidence, the investigation
determined the virus was active on our network from december 4, 2019, to december 7, 2019. we determined that
the virus was introduced by an unknown individual or individuals outside our organization who gained access to part
of our network where we store some client files, including files from ccp.
because there was a risk that ccpâ€™s data may have been accessed, acquired, or otherwise disclosed without authorization
from bstâ€™s network, we reviewed all ccp data to determine whether it included personal information. the review, after
addition of contact information, was completed on february 5, 2020, and revealed some of the potentially accessed ccp
files contained protected health information for certain individuals, including you. you may be wondering why we had
your information in the first place. as part of our work for ccp, we review financial documents that may contain patient
information such as names, account numbers, dates of birth, and medical billing codes.
the forensic investigation could not conclude that any of your protected health information was accessed or acquired
by an unauthorized individual. however, in an abundance of caution, we are providing you with notice of the possible
unauthorized disclosure and one (1) year of identity monitoring at no cost to you to allow you to take steps to protect
your personal information, if you feel it is appropriate to do so. & what information was involved
bst is unable to confirm whether your information was actually obtained by an unauthorized individual. our
investigation determined that as a result of this incident, some of your protected health information may have been
accessed or acquired without authorization, including your first and last name, <<data elements1-affected info>>.
this information appeared incidentally on ccp balance statements that were provided to us in order for bst to
provide accounting services to ccp. bst does not use your information in connection with any other purpose. your
medical records and social security number were not impacted by this incident. we do not possess such information
because ccp does not share that information with us.	based on the information provided, there was a virus that infected the organization's network and an outside individual or individuals gained unauthorized access to part of their network where they store client files. this indicates a hacking incident.
on or around june 14, 2019, nch became aware of suspicious activity related to our human
resources, timekeeping, and payroll system. we immediately launched an investigation into this suspicious
activity and determined that certain employees fell victim to an email phishing scheme that allowed an
unauthorized actor (hacker) to gain access to the employee's payroll records as well as their email accounts.
importantly, nch patient medical record systems were not affected by this incident, and the sole purpose of the
attack appears to have been to reroute direct deposit payroll funds; however, the stolen credentials allowed access
to employee email accounts. third party specialists undertook a diligent and time-consuming manual and
programmatic review of the entire contents of the relevant email accounts to determine what data was present as
the investigation was not able to determine if any email was actually viewed. on december 19, 2019, the review
provided confirmation of the identities of those individuals who may have had information present within the
email accounts under review.
our investigation determined the following info1mation may have been
accessible: <<data elements>>. & <<data elements>> (censored)	the unauthorized access to the employee's payroll records and email accounts suggests that this was a hack by an outside party using an email phishing scheme.
we value and respect the privacy of your information, which is why we are writing to advise you of a recent data security

3. telephone. contact myidcare at (833) 554-0513 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. if you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in myidcare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the myidcare website and filing a request for help. if you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our id care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. in the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an id care specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

credit bureaus
equifax fraud reporting
1-866-349-5191
p.o. box 105069
atlanta, ga 30348-5069
www.equifax.com

experian fraud reporting
1-888-397-3742
p.o. box 9554
allen, tx 75013
www.experian.com

transunion fraud reporting
1-800-680-7289
p.o. box 2000
chester, pa 19022-2000
www.transunion.com

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year.

6. security freeze. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. there is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit	this breach was categorized as hack as the institution's email accounts were hacked by an unauthorized user.

2. placing a security freeze on your credit file
if you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a security freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. a security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. you may place a security freeze on your credit report by sending a request in writing or by mail, to all three nationwide credit reporting companies. to find out more about how to place a security freeze, you can use the following contact information:

equifax security freeze: https://www.freeze.equifax.com or 1-800-685-1111
experian security freeze: http://experian.com/freeze or 1-888-397-3742

if your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name, or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the city in which you currently reside.

3. obtaining a free credit report
under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. verify all information is correct. if you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

4. accessing additional helpful resources
even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the federal trade commission (ftc) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. checking your credit report periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.

if you find suspicious activity on your credit reports or have reason to believe your information is being misused, call your local law enforcement agency and file a police report. be sure to obtain a copy of the police report, as many creditors will want the information it contains to absolve you of the fraudulent debts. you may also file a complaint with the ftc by contacting them on the web at www.ftc.gov/idtheft, by phone at 1-877-idtheft (1-877-438-4338), or by mail at federal trade commission, consumer response center, 600 pennsylvania avenue nw, washington, dc 20580. your complaint will be added to the ftc's identity theft data clearinghouse, where it will be accessible to law enforcement for their investigations.

on january 15, 2020, walgreens discovered an error within the walgreens mobile app personal secure 
messaging feature. our investigation determined that an internal application error allowed certain personal 
messages from walgreens that are stored in a database to be viewable by other customers using the 
walgreens mobile app. once we learned of the incident, walgreens promptly took steps to temporarily 
disable message viewing to prevent further disclosure and then implemented a technical correction that
resolved the issue. 

as part of our investigation, walgreens determined that certain messages containing limited health-related 
information were involved in this incident for a small percentage of impacted customers. we believe that 
you were part of the impacted customer group and that one or more personal messages containing your 
limited health-related information may have been viewed by another customer on the walgreens mobile 
app between january 9, 2020 and january 15, 2020. & what information was involved 
our investigation determined the following information might have been viewed by another customer:

3. telephone. contact myidcare at 1-833-554-0514 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. if you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in myidcare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the myidcare website and filing a request for help. if you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our id care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. in the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an id care specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

credit bureaus
equifax fraud reporting 1-866-349-5191 p.o. box 105069 atlanta, ga 30348-5069 www.alerts.equifax.com
experian fraud reporting 1-888-397-3742 p.o. box 9554 allen, tx 75013 www.experian.com
transunion fraud reporting 1-800-680-7289 p.o. box 2000 chester, pa 19022-2000 www.transunion.com

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year.

please note: no one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. security freeze. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift	this breach was due to inadvertent disclosure and not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss. ultipro by ultimate software group, inc. accidentally sent an email containing personal information to the wrong recipient. although there was no evidence of misuse of personal information, the company provided identity protection services to reduce the chances of identity theft or fraud on accounts.

our investigation determined the following information might have been viewed by another customer:

- first and last name
- prescription number and drug name
- store number
- shipping address where applicable

what are we doing

what you can do

walgreens recommends customers monitor their prescription and medical records. even though no financial information was involved, we have enclosed information on steps you can take to further protect your information, and how to obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three (3) major credit reporting agencies as a courtesy for your reference.

you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

additional information to protect yourself

to protect against possible fraud, identity theft or other financial loss, we encourage you to remain vigilant, to review your account statements and to monitor your credit reports. provided below are the names and contact information for the three major u.s. credit bureaus and additional information about steps you can take to obtain a free credit report and place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report. if you believe you are a victim of fraud or identity theft you should consider contacting your local law enforcement agency, your states attorney general, or the federal trade commission. please know that contacting us will not expedite any remediation of suspicious activity.

information on obtaining a free credit report

u.s. residents are entitled under u.s. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. to order your free credit reports, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free at +1 (877) 726-1014.

information on implementing a fraud alert or security freeze

consider contacting the three major credit bureaus at the addresses below to place a fraud alert on your credit report. a fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. a fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit. instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name. a security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumers credit report without written authorization. however, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing or other services. a credit reporting agency may not charge you to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. to place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, you must contact the three credit bureaus below:

equifax: consumer fraud division p.o. box 740256 atlanta, ga 30374 +1 (888) 766-0008	an unsanctioned third party gained unauthorized access to some employee email accounts that contained personal information regarding guests. between april 11 and july 23, 2019.
contents of data breach notification letter: we are writing to inform you of a data security incident that may have impacted some of your personal information. we take the protection of our patients' information seriously, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this incident may cause. this letter provides you with information concerning the incident as well as detailed information about steps we have taken to mitigate the effects of this incident.

what happened?

on january 31, 2020, we discovered that a stolen backup hard drive contained some patient information. the backup hard drive was taken along with other employee personal items. we immediately reported this incident to law enforcement and conducted an investigation to determine which patients may have had information on the hard drive that could have been viewed.

what information was involved?

while we have no reason to believe that your information was the target of the theft, and the password-protected backup data file requires proprietary program software to be read, there were some supporting documents on the hard drive as well that could have been viewed. that information may have included treatment consent forms, referral letters, emails, and some x-ray images. specifically, names, addresses, dates of birth, some healthcare information, and a limited number of social security numbers were viewable. out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying all patients.

what we are doing

we take the security of patient information seriously and have taken steps to prevent a recurrence, including ensuring all employees are aware of the requirement to protect patient information and increasing hardware security protocols. given the difficulty to access the hard drive, we consider it highly unlikely that your information has been misused. however, out of an abundance of caution, we are offering identity theft protection services through id experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with myidcare. myidcare services include: 12 months of credit and cyberscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. with this protection, myidcare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised. to activate credit monitoring, you must be over the age of 18 and have established credit in the u.s. with a social security number in your name.

what you can do

information on implementing a fraud alert or security freeze

consider contacting the three major credit bureaus at the addresses below to place a fraud alert on your credit report. a fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. a fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit. instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name. a security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumers credit report without written authorization. however, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing or other services. a credit reporting agency may not charge you to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze. to place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, you must contact the three credit bureaus below:

3. consider placing a security freeze on your credit file.

if you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, you may request a security freeze be placed on your credit file, at no charge. a security freeze prohibits, with certain specific exceptions, the consumer reporting agencies from releasing your credit report or any information from it without your express authorization. you may place a security freeze on your credit report by contacting all three nationwide credit reporting companies at the numbers below and following the stated directions or by sending a request in writing, by mail, to all three credit reporting companies:

equifax security freeze p.o. box 105788 atlanta, ga 30348 https://www.freeze.equifax.com 1-800-349-9960

experian security freeze p.o. box 9554 allen, tx 75013 http://experian.com/freeze 1-888-397-3742

transunion security freeze p.o. box 2000 chester, pa 19016 http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze 1-888-909-8872

in order to place the security freeze, you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number, and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.

if your personal information has been used to file a false tax return, to open an account or to attempt to open an account in your name or to commit fraud or other crimes against you, you may file a police report in the city in which you currently reside.

if you do place a security freeze prior to enrolling in the credit monitoring service as described above, you will need to remove the freeze to sign up for the credit monitoring service. after you sign up for the credit monitoring service, you may refreeze your credit file.

4. obtaining a free credit report.

under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report every 12 months from each of the above three major nationwide credit reporting companies. call 1-877-322-8228 or request your free credit reports online at www.annualcreditreport.com. once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. verify all information is correct. if you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.

on january 6, 2020, torrance memorial was notified that a server used by its outside radiology vendor to receive radiological images from torrance memorial was unsecured and potentially accessible to unauthorized people. upon receiving this notice, torrance memorial took immediate steps to investigate and address the issue. our investigation revealed that the server, which is owned and maintained by the vendor at its office, was unsecured from june 20, 2019 until december 13, 2019 when the vendor discovered the issue and secured the server. the vendor has confirmed that subsequent scans of its systems show that the server is now secure. based on our investigation, we have no evidence that any of your patient images were accessed by any unauthorized persons. we discovered that this vendor stores a small volume of patient images on this server temporarily and automatically deletes them from the server every 24 hours.

what information was involved?

the images and information that were transmitted through the server were for the purpose of providing a professional radiologic reading of patient images. the patient image files on the unsecured server during that time include the patient name, date of birth, gender, medical record number, accession number, and referring physician (if available). the files did not contain social security numbers or any financial/payment information.

what we are doing

out of an abundance of caution, we have chosen to notify patients whose records were temporarily stored on the server between june 20, 2019 and december 13, 2019 about this incident. torrance memorial takes the security and protection of your personal information seriously and we are holding the vendor accountable for raising their security standards to be as stringent as torrance memorial's. as an added precaution to help protect your information from potential misuse, we are offering identity theft monitoring and restoration services through first watch id for a period of 12 months at no cost to you. the identity restoration services are automatically available to you with no enrollment required, but the identity monitoring services do require enrollment. for enrollment instructions and further information about these services, including your personal verification code that you will use to enroll, please refer to enclosed documentation.

what you can do

we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing and monitoring your account statements and credit reports. you also may file a report with law enforcement, your state attorney general, and/or the federal trade commission. in addition, please refer to the enclosed documentation which contains additional steps you may take to protect your information from misuse, including some information that may be specific to your state of residence.

we regret to inform you that a recent incident may have exposed some of your personal information to an unintended audience. on august 27, 2019, an unauthorized third party illegally accessed one of our employee's email accounts. upon learning of the incident, we promptly secured the email account to prevent further access. we also retained a leading forensic security firm to investigate the incident and confirm the security of our email and computer systems.

our investigation, which concluded on december 5, 2019, determined that the email account contained some of your personal information. the impacted information for each individual differs but may have included your name, address, and financial account number. for a small number of individuals, the information may have also included their date of birth, phone number, electronic signature, and/or credit/debit card number. your social security number was not impacted, and at this point, we do not know for certain if any personal information was ever viewed by the unauthorized party. we are not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft as a result of this incident.

we apologize for any inconvenience or concern this incident might cause. we are committed to taking steps to help prevent something like this from happening again, including strengthening email security. for further information and assistance, please call [phone number] monday through friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. central time.

sincerely,

additional important information:

as a precautionary measure, we recommend that you remain vigilant to help protect against potential fraud and/or identity theft by reviewing your account statements and monitoring credit reports closely. if you detect any suspicious activity on an account, you should promptly notify the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained. you should also promptly report any fraudulent activity or any suspected incidents of identity theft to proper law enforcement authorities, including the police and your state's attorney general, as well as the federal trade commission (ftc).

you may wish to review the tips provided by the ftc on fraud alerts, security/credit freezes, and steps you can take to avoid identity theft. for more information and to contact the ftc, please visit www.ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-id-theft (1-877-438-4338). you may also contact the ftc at: federal trade commission, 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20580.

credit reports: you may obtain a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by completing an annual credit report request form and mailing it to annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga 30348. you can print a copy of the request form at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/manualrequestform.action.

alternatively, you may elect to purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one of the three national credit reporting agencies. contact information for the three national credit reporting agencies for the purpose of requesting a copy of your credit report or for general inquiries, including obtaining information about fraud alerts and placing a security freeze on your credit files, is as follows:

equifax 1-866-349-5191 www.equifax.com p.o. box 740241 atlanta, ga 30374
experian 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com p.o. box 9554 allen, tx 75013
transunion 1-800-888-4213 www.transunion.com p.o. box 1000 chester, pa 19016

fraud alerts: you may want to consider placing a fraud alert on your credit report. an initial fraud alert is free and will stay on your credit file for at least one (1) year. the alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the creditor contact you prior to establishing any new accounts in your name. to place a fraud alert on your credit report, contact any of the three national credit reporting agencies using the contact information listed above. additional information is available at http://www.annualcreditreport.com.

credit and security freezes: you may have the right to place a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate the freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. since the instructions for how to establish a credit freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified above to find out more information.

individuals interacting with credit reporting agencies have rights under the fair credit reporting act. we encourage you to review your rights under the fair credit reporting act by visiting www.consumerfinance.gov/f/201504_cfpb_summary_your-rights-under-fcra.pdf, or by requesting information in writing from the consumer response center, room 130-a, federal trade commission, 600 pennsylvania ave. nw, washington, dc 20580.

re: security incident notification

dear sir or madam:

we are writing on behalf of our client, wichita state university (wsu), to notify your office of a security incident. in december 2019, wsu learned of a security incident involving unauthorized access to a computer server that wsu used to operate various student and employee web portals. wsu immediately secured this server and engaged a leading computer forensic firm to investigate the incident to determine its scope and impact.

the investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to this computer server between december 3, 2019, and december 5, 2019. wsu performed a comprehensive review of the server and, on january 13, 2020, determined that information stored in a historical database on the server contained the individuals' names, email addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers.

on march 6, 2020, wsu began mailing written notifications to the 1,762 potentially affected iowa residents in accordance with iowa code ann. 715c.1 et seq. in substantially the same form as the enclosed letter. wsu is offering identity theft protection services through id experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide affected iowa residents with myidcare. myidcare services include: 12 months of credit and cyberscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. wsu also provided a telephone number for potentially affected individuals to call with any questions they may have about the incident.

to help prevent an incident like this from happening in the future, wsu is taking steps to enhance their existing security protocols and is re-educating its staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

additional information to protect yourself

in addition to considering enrolling in credit monitoring services, it is always a good idea to remain vigilant, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports. provided below are the names and contact information for the three major u.s. credit bureaus and additional information about steps you can take to obtain a free credit report and place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report.

if you believe you are a victim of fraud or identity theft, you should contact your local law enforcement agency, your state's attorney general, or the federal trade commission.

information on obtaining a free credit report

u.s. residents are entitled under u.s. law to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. to order your free credit reports, visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call toll-free (877) 726-1014.

information on implementing a fraud alert or security freeze

you can contact the three major credit bureaus at the addresses below to place a fraud alert on your credit report. a fraud alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a possible victim of fraud. a fraud alert does not affect your ability to get a loan or credit. instead, it alerts a business that your personal information might have been compromised and requires that business to verify your identity before issuing you credit. although this may cause some short delay if you are the one applying for the credit, it might protect against someone else obtaining credit in your name. a security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer's credit report without written authorization. however, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

a credit reporting agency may not charge you to place, temporarily lift, or permanently remove a security freeze.

to place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, you must contact the three credit bureaus below:

equifax:
consumer fraud division
p.o. box 740256
atlanta, ga 30374
(888) 766-0008
www.equifax.com

experian:

transunion:
transunion llc
p.o. box 2000
chester, pa 19022-2000
(800) 680-7289
www.transunion.com

to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following	the description indicates that the breach was the result of a malicious attack against t-mobile's email vendor that led to unauthorized access to certain t-mobile employee email accounts, indicating that it was a hacking incident.
insufficient information	there is not enough information provided to classify the breach into any specific "type of breach" category.

we are writing to notify you of a security incident on behalf of our client, woods & woods, llc, located in evansville, indiana. washington residents may have been impacted by the security incident.

re: incident notification

dear sir or madam:

we are writing on behalf of our client, wichita state university (wsu), to notify your office of a security incident involving 2,649 washington residents. wsu is located in wichita, kansas.

in december 2019, wsu learned of a security incident involving unauthorized access to a computer server that wsu used to operate various student and employee web portals. wsu immediately secured this server and engaged a leading computer forensic firm to investigate the incident to determine its scope and impact.

the investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to this computer server between december 3, 2019, and december 5, 2019. wsu performed a comprehensive review of the server and, on january 13, 2020, determined that information stored in a historical database on the server contained the individuals' names, email addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers.

on march 6, 2020, wsu began mailing notice via postal mail to the potentially affected washington residents in accordance with wests rcwa 19.255.010.1. a copy of the notification letter is enclosed. wsu is offering identity theft protection services through id experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide affected washington residents with myidcare. myidcare services include: 12 months of credit and cyberscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services.

wsu also provided a telephone number for potentially affected washington residents to call with any questions they may have about the incident.

to help prevent an incident like this from happening in the future, wsu is taking steps to enhance their existing security protocols and is re-educating its staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

on february 11, 2020, the wsp received a letter envelope from a law firm in everett, wa, that was to contain a thumb drive containing documents provided to the law firm by wsp, under a protection order. the associated, non-redacted documents contained personal identifying information from a child exploitation investigation, conducted in 2016. the law firm represented one of the arrested suspects and requested documents of their client's arrest as well as several other documents associated with other suspects arrested during the operation. witness personal identiiying information was also contained in the provided documents.
the law firm received the thumb drive from wsp without incident but returned the thumb drive in a manner that did not demonstrate the same level of protection to prevent loss. as a result, the letter envelope the thumb drive was placed in, to send back to wsp, was breached and the thumb drive lost.
number of affected individuals
we have identified 16 individuals who lost personal identifying information. information each individual lost varies but includes some or a combination of the following: names and dates of birth, names and dates of birth of suspect/witness children, driver's license numbers and pictures, abstract of driving records, social security numbers, residence addresses, phone numbers, vehicle registrations, and criminal history information. & names and dates of birth, names and dates of birth of suspect/witness children, driver's license numbers and pictures, abstract of driving records, social security numbers, residence addresses, phone numbers, vehicle registrations, and criminal history information.	the breach was due to unintended disclosure not involving hacking, intentional breach or physical loss, but rather due to the law firm's failure to adequately protect the thumb drive containing sensitive information before returning it to the wsp, resulting in the thumb drive being lost during transit.

4. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. if you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in myidcare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the myidcare website and filing a request for help. if you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our id care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. in the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an id care specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

credit bureaus

equifax fraud reporting 1-866-349-5191 p.o. box 105069 atlanta, ga 30348-5069 www.equifax.com

experian fraud reporting 1-888-397-3742 p.o. box 9554 allen, tx 75013 www.experian.com

transunion fraud reporting 1-800-680-7289 p.o. box 2000 chester, pa 19022-2000 www.transunion.com

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year.

6. security freeze. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. there is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. you can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. the federal trade commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them.

re: notice of incident

dear sir/madam:

we are writing to notify you of a security incident on behalf of our client, woods & woods, llc, located in evansville, indiana. iowa residents may have been impacted by the security incident.

on february 1, 2020, woods & woods, llc became aware that it was the victim of a ransomware attack. woods & woods promptly took steps to secure its information systems and investigate the incident, including contacting the fbi and hiring a forensic cybersecurity firm, to try to determine which, if any, information may have been accessed or stolen. as a result of the investigation, on february 25, 2020, woods & woods concluded that some information was stolen, but that it will likely not be able to determine all of the specific information that was accessed or stolen; therefore woods & woods is notifying all potentially affected individuals of the incident.

the data involved included demographic information of individuals, such as names, addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers, as well as medical information and bank account number and routing number of some individuals. woods & woods continues to pursue measures to protect and secure its data.

dear <<first name>> <<last name>> :

wichita state university (wsu) recently learned of a security incident that may have involved some of your information. we write to provide you with information on the incident, the steps wsu is taking in response to this incident, and steps that you may take to better protect your information, should you feel it is appropriate.

in december 2019, wsu learned of a security incident involving unauthorized access to a computer server that wsu used to operate various student and employee web portals. wsu immediately secured this server and engaged a leading computer forensic firm to investigate the incident to determine its scope and impact. the investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to this computer server between december 3, 2019 and december 5, 2019.

wsu performed a comprehensive review of the server and, on january 13, 2020, determined that information stored in a historical database on the server contained your name, email address, date of birth, and social security number.

upon learning of this incident, wsu immediately took steps to respond and worked with outside experts to confirm the nature and scope of the incident and identify individuals whose information may have been stored on the affected server. while wsu does not have any evidence of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident, out of an abundance of caution, wsu is offering identity theft protection services through id experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with myidcare. myidcare services include: 12 months of credit and cyberscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. with this protection, myidcare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised. and, to help prevent a similar incident in the future, we are taking steps to enhance our existing security protocols and re-educating our staff for awareness on these types of incidents.

we encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity. we also encourage you to contact id experts with any questions and to enroll in free myidcare services by calling 1-833-570-0375 or going to https://ide.myidcare.com/wsu and using the enrollment code provided above. myidcare experts are available monday through friday from 8 am - 8 pm central time. please note the deadline to enroll is june 5, 2020.

you will find detailed instructions for enrollment on the enclosed recommended steps document. also, you will need to reference the enrollment code at the top of this letter when calling or enrolling online, so please do not discard this letter.

we understand that you may have questions about this incident that are not addressed in this letter. to ensure your questions are answered in a timely manner, we established a dedicated assistance line at 1-833-570-0375, which may be reached monday through friday, between 8 am and 8 pm central time. wsu will not contact you by phone to request any personal information.

we apologize for any inconvenience or concern this may cause.

to enroll, please call: 1-833-570-0375
or visit: https://ide.myidcare.com/wsu
enrollment code: <<xxxxxxxx>>

recommended steps to help protect your information

1. website and enrollment. go to https://ide.myidcare.com/wsu and follow the instructions for enrollment using your enrollment code provided at the top of the letter.

2. activate the credit monitoring provided as part of your myidcare membership. the monitoring included in the membership must be activated to be effective. note: you must have established credit and access to a computer and the internet to use this service. if you need assistance, myidcare will be able to assist you.

3. telephone. contact myidcare at 1-833-570-0375 to gain additional information about this event and speak with knowledgeable representatives about the appropriate steps to take to protect your credit identity.

4. review your credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring credit reports. under federal law, you also are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call 1-877-322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

if you discover any suspicious items and have enrolled in myidcare, notify them immediately by calling or by logging into the myidcare website and filing a request for help. if you file a request for help or report suspicious activity, you will be contacted by a member of our id care team who will help you determine the cause of the suspicious items. in the unlikely event that you fall victim to identity theft as a consequence of this incident, you will be assigned an id care specialist who will work on your behalf to identify, stop and reverse the damage quickly. you should also know that you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you can report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement or to the attorney general.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

on february 11, 2020, the wsp received a letter envelope from a law firm in everett, wa, that was to contain a thumb drive containing documents provided to the law firm by wsp, under a protection order. the associated, non-redacted documents contained personal identifying information from a child exploitation investigation, conducted in 2016. the law firm represented one of the arrested suspects and requested documents of their client's arrest as well as several other documents associated with other suspects arrested during the operation. witness personal identifying information was also contained in the provided documents.

the law firm received the thumb drive from wsp without incident but returned the thumb drive in a manner that did not demonstrate the same level of protection to prevent loss. as a result, the letter envelope the thumb drive was placed in, to send back to wsp, was breached and the thumb drive lost.

number of affected individuals

we have identified 16 individuals who lost personal identifying information. information each individual lost varies but includes some or a combination of the following: names and dates of birth, names and dates of birth of suspect/witness children, driver's license numbers and pictures, abstract of driving records, social security numbers, residence addresses, phone numbers, vehicle registrations, and criminal history information.

steps wsp has taken with respect to incident

we are notifying the affected persons, by first class mail deposited on this date, of the possible exposure of their personal information. attached is a sample copy of the notice.

subject: inadvertent release of information

the purpose of this letter is to inform you of the potential loss of your personal information contained in electronic records maintained by the washington state patrol (wsp).

the wsp produced records containing personal information to a law firm, under a protective order. it is our understanding the law firm mailed a thumb drive containing those records to the wsp through the united states postal service (usps). however, the thumb drive did not arrive at the wsp, and it appears to have been lost in transit. the wsp has contacted the relevant mail courier to locate the thumb drive, and has made a claim with the usps to locate the thumb drive.

the personal information contained on the thumb drive may have included your name and date of birth, your child/children's names and dates of birth, address and driver's license number, abstract copy of driving record, social security number, residence address, criminal history, and/or phone number. we have no evidence any of the data has been accessed or used, but we want to notify you of the possibility. we apologize for this incident and any inconvenience it may have caused.

if you have questions or concerns regarding this incident, please contact captain roger wilbur at (360) 704-2395 or via email at roger.wilbur(%wsp.wa.gov.

notice of data breach

what happened?
on march 11, 2020, new heights ventures discovered that an outside entity gained access to a member of management's email and cloud-based server password. they then forwarded an email to the member of management's contacts. two new heights ventures office employees received the email from the member of management and entered their passwords as well. at that point, it was quickly discovered that this was a malicious event, and we took steps to cut access from the outside entity. the member of management, whose account was breached, realized he had received an email seemingly from an employee of another agency and entered his email and password on 3/6/2020 to try to open a document. this appears to be how the perpetrators emailed his contact list.

what information was involved?
since the email and cloud-based server use the same password, electronic copies of employee files could have been accessed. electronic files of employee passwords can include information such as names, birthdates, social security numbers, livescan results, medical leave information, etc.

what we are doing.
we take this incident extremely seriously and have now initiated a 2-factor authorization for cloud-based server and email access and are looking at other options to protect new heights ventures employee and person-served information. we are also looking at removing cloud-based storage for employee files and using an onsite encrypted server for this information. additionally, we are contacting the various governmental agencies, which are to be involved in this type of incident.

what you can do.
in the event the perpetrators accessed employee file information, we recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit file. a fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. call any one of the three major credit bureaus. as soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. the initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you can renew it after one year.

other important information.
we greatly value your employment with new heights ventures and are extremely upset this occurred. we will take the necessary steps to prevent this from happening again as we want your information to be kept safe from intrusion. please contact us for help with taking any of the requested steps, such as getting fraud alerts and/or credit freezes.

upon learning of the incident, zerbee promptly commenced an investigation. we have taken steps to determine how the incident occurred and to ensure appropriate action is being taken in response. zerbee takes the protection of your personal information very seriously, and will continue to take steps to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident.

what you can do

you should remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. if you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions, as major credit card companies have rules that restrict them from requiring you to pay for fraudulent charges that are timely reported.

in addition, you may contact the federal trade commission (ftc) or law enforcement, such as your state attorney general, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. you can contact the ftc at:

federal trade commission
600 pennsylvania avenue, nw
washington, dc 20580
(877) idtheft (438-4338)
https://www.identitytheft.gov/

if you find that your information has been misused, the ftc encourages you to file a complaint with the ftc and to take these additional steps: (1) close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently; and (2) file and keep a copy of a local police report as evidence of the identity theft crime and in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records.

we value your business and respect the privacy of your information. we are writing to let you know about a recent incident that may have involved your personal information. this notice explains the incident, the measures we have taken in response, and some additional steps you may consider taking.

what happened?

on january 22, 2020, zerbee, llc, learned that it may have experienced a security incident involving unauthorized access to certain customer payment card information. upon receiving this information, zerbee commenced an investigation into the incident.

oregon department of human services notifies public of data breach

(salem, ore.) on march 6, the oregon department of human services (dhs) discovered a phishing incident that affected one staff member's email. the department of human services takes the privacy and confidentiality of employee and client information seriously. established information technology security processes enabled the agency to detect and contain the incident quickly and stop the unauthorized access.

what happened?

a spear-phishing email was sent to a dhs employee. the employee opened the phishing email and exposed their credentials to an outside entity. the agency cannot confirm that any client or employee's personal information was copied or used inappropriately.

what dhs is doing about it

dhs is thoroughly reviewing the incident and the information involved. dhs plans to contract with an outside entity to clarify the number and identities of any individuals whose information was compromised, and the specific kinds of information involved. while there is no indication that any protected health information was copied or used inappropriately, dhs will notify any individuals whose information was compromised. dhs will provide identity theft protection services to potentially impacted employees and clients.

the security and confidentiality of private health information is critical to the department of human services. while the department cannot confirm that any client's personal information was acquired from its email system or used inappropriately, it is notifying the public because information was accessible to an unauthorized person or persons. dhs will provide updates as more information is known.

# # #	the breach was a result of a phishing incident which affected one staff member's email, where the employee opened the phishing email and exposed their credentials to an outside entity.
insufficient information	there is insufficient information provided to make a determination regarding the type of breach that occurred at general electric.
what happened?
on january 23, 2020, two of our counselorsâ€™ cell phones were stolen from renewâ€™s office. the phones had access
to renewâ€™s gmail account, which had some messages containing personal information for some clients. the phones
were not secured by password and could have been accessed by the person who took them. however, we immediately
notified the cellular carriers, who blocked cellular access to the phones within hours after the theft. our investigation
has thus revealed no evidence that your personal information was actually accessed by any unauthorized person, but
we have chosen to notify all potentially affected individuals about this incident out of an abundance of caution. & what information was involved?
the gmail account potentially accessible on the two cell phones included messages containing names, addresses,
telephone numbers, email addresses, and in some cases medical diagnosis information of some of renewâ€™s clients
used for billing purposes, as well as some appointment dates. in a small percentage of cases there could also have
been social security numbers and financial account or card numbers in the gmail account.	the theft of unsecured cell phones with access to renew's gmail account which contained personal information of clients, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, medical diagnosis information, and in some cases, social security numbers and financial information, does not indicate hacking or intentional insider activity, but is instead an unintended disclosure due to physical loss.

additional steps to help protect your information

review personal account statements and credit reports. we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing personal account statements and monitoring credit reports to detect any errors or unauthorized activity. under federal law, you are entitled every 12 months to one free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies. to obtain a free annual credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com or call (877) 322-8228. you may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months. if you discover any suspicious items, you should report any incorrect information on your report to the credit reporting agency.

report suspected fraud. you have the right to file a police report if you ever experience identity fraud. please note that in order to file a crime report or incident report with law enforcement for identity theft, you will likely need to provide some kind of proof that you have been a victim. a police report is often required to dispute fraudulent items. you should report suspected incidents of identity theft to local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and/or the federal trade commission.

place fraud alerts. a fraud alert tells businesses that check your credit that they should check with you before opening a new account. starting september 21, 2018, when you place a fraud alert, it will last one year, instead of 90 days. fraud alerts will still be free, and identity theft victims can still get an extended fraud alert for seven years. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. to place a security freeze, contact the nationwide credit reporting agencies by phone or online.

place a security freeze. security freezes, also known as credit freezes, restrict access to your credit file, making it harder for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. starting	the data breach in renew wellness center pllc involves the theft of two unsecured cell phones which had access to renew's gmail account containing some messages that contained personal information of some of their clients used for billing purposes, as well as some appointment dates such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and in some cases, medical diagnosis information.

contents of data breach notification letter: this notice will be updated with any new significant information learned after its submission. by providing this notice, the ymca of columbia-willamette (the ymca) does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of oregon law, the applicability of the oregon data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

nature of the data event:
the ymca discovered unusual activity related to an employee email account. the ymca immediately began an investigation and with the help of third-party forensic investigators, it was determined that a single employee email account may have been accessed without authorization between december 19, 2019, and december 27, 2019. although it was unclear which specific emails within the account were viewed by an unauthorized actor, the ymca conducted a comprehensive review of the email account to identify what information could potentially have been viewed during this time. through this process, the ymca determined that certain personal information was present in the email account at the time of the incident. to date, the ymca is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this information as a result of this incident. the types of information potentially impacted in relation to this incident include the following: name, social security number, driver license/state identification number, payment card information, medical information, health insurance information, username and password or login information, and/or passport number. the impacted data elements were not the same for each affected individual.

notice to oregon residents:
on or about march 27, 2020, the ymca began mailing written notice of this incident to all affected individuals, which includes six hundred ninety-six oregon residents. written notice to the individuals is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as exhibit a.

other steps taken and to be taken:
immediately upon learning of this incident, the ymca worked diligently with the assistance of third-party forensics specialists to investigate the nature and scope of the event, to review the information that may have been contained in the email account to confirm what data was present, and to identify to whom this information related. this forensics process included both a programmatic and a manual review of documents. once this investigation was complete, the ymca undertook review of its systems and records to determine appropriate contact information for individuals potentially involved in the data event to provide notice of the event and access to resources to assist these individuals in learning more about the event and steps they may wish to take to protect their information. the ymca is providing affected individuals access to twelve (12) months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services, through kroll cyber security. additionally, the ymca is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of identity theft and fraud by reviewing account statements and explanation of benefits forms and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

we recently learned that a software code change made to the myblue member portal inadvertently
altered blue cross and blue shield federal employee program (fep) member usersâ€™ access for a short
period of time. the change was made as part of a good faith effort to improve fep membersâ€™ secure access
to their information, due to changes being made to a third-party web browserâ€™s security requirement.
through this code change, we have learned that your personal and health information may have been
accessible to other myblue portal members between the evening of february 4, 2020 and the morning of
february 5, 2020. when we learned of this issue on the morning of february 5, 2020, we promptly
terminated all member access to the myblue member portal to investigate and remediate the issue. as
a result of the investigation, by february 25, 2020, we were able to determine that your personal
information may have been accessible to another fep member who had logged into the myblue portal
with their own myblue credentials during the brief incident window. however, to date, we are not aware
of any misuse of the information that was potentially accessible because of this incident.& although we were able to conclude that your personal and health information was accessible to another
fep member during the incident window, we are unable to determine what specific information, if
any, was accessed. this is because the information that may have been accessible through the myblue
member portal to another fep member varied by member. however, the information may have included
(1) information to identify and contact you (such as first, middle, and last name, address, phone number(s),
social security number, email address, group and member id numbers, and date of birth); (2) information
related to medical and/or claims histories (such as medical providers, dates of service, diagnoses, treatment
information, test results and medical records); and (3) information regarding prescriptions, including drug
name, number, prescriber name and pharmacy name. the incident did not involve potential access to
your full financial account, or credit or debit card numbers.	the breach involved an unintended disclosure of personal information due to a software code change that allowed other blue cross blue shield federal employee program members to inadvertently access other members' personal and health information between february 4 and february 5, 2020. although it is not clear if any of the information was actually accessed, the affected information included identifying information, medical and claims history, and prescription information.

what happened

between october 31, 2019 and december 26, 2019, our web server was breached and order information was potentially collected. while our system does not store payment card information, the unauthorized third party may nonetheless have been able to access and acquire information used to pay for purchases in our online store. though you may have contacted our support center directly via phone, our online store uses the same system which our technical support team also utilizes to place phone orders.

what information was involved

the personal information potentially involved may have included first and last names, shipping and billing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and credit card information including account numbers, expiration dates, and three-digit security codes. please note that you are receiving this notification only because an attempted transaction occurred in our system during the potentially exposed time period; we cannot confirm your actual information was in fact involved in the potential incident.

what we are doing

we take this matter very seriously and apologize for any inconvenience caused. upon learning of the incident, we took immediate measures to contain and neutralize the vulnerability and immediately began a forensic investigation to determine the extent of the third party criminal conduct. we have also deployed, and continue to deploy, additional security procedures to prevent future attacks. finally, we have engaged cyber security legal counsel to guide us through this process.

in addition, we are offering identity theft protection services through id experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with myidcare. myidcare services include: 24 months of credit and cyberscan monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, and fully managed id theft recovery services. with this protection, myidcare will help you resolve issues if your identity is compromised.

5. place fraud alerts with the three credit bureaus. if you choose to place a fraud alert, we recommend you do this after activating your credit monitoring. you can place a fraud alert at one of the three major credit bureaus by phone and also via experian's or equifax's website. a fraud alert tells creditors to follow certain procedures, including contacting you, before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. for that reason, placing a fraud alert can protect you, but also may delay you when you seek to obtain credit. the contact information for all three bureaus is as follows:

equifax p.o. box 740241 atlanta, georgia 30374 1 (866)349-5191 www.equifax.com

experian p.o. box 4500 allen, texas 75013 1 (888) 397-3742 www.experian.com

transunion p.o. box 2000 chester, pennsylvania 19016-2000 1 (888) 909-8872 www.transunion.com

it is necessary to contact only one of these bureaus and use only one of these methods. as soon as one of the three bureaus confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place alerts on their records as well. you will receive confirmation letters in the mail and will then be able to order all three credit reports, free of charge, for your review. an initial fraud alert will last for one year. please note: no one is allowed to place a fraud alert on your credit report except you.

6. security freeze. by placing a security freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires your personal identifying information will not be able to use that information to open new accounts or borrow money in your name. you will need to contact the three national credit reporting bureaus listed above to place the freeze. keep in mind that when you place the freeze, you will not be able to borrow money, obtain instant credit, or get a new credit card until you temporarily lift or permanently remove the freeze. there is no cost to freeze or unfreeze your credit files.

7. you can obtain additional information about the steps you can take to avoid identity theft from the following agencies. the federal trade commission also encourages those who discover that their information has been misused to file a complaint with them. please call 800-939-4170 or go to https://ide.myidcare.com/customending; https://app.myidcare.com/account-creation/protect for assistance or for any additional questions you may have.

we remain committed to protecting your personal information. we again sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident. we are undertaking measures to further secure your personal information, and are continuously monitoring our processes to prevent similar incidents in the future.

sincerely,

we are writing to inform you that on saturday, march 14, 2020, the jamaica national group experienced a data breach as a result of a ransomware attack. although our services are now substantially back online, we have identified that data relating to some members and customers was possibly taken during the data security incident. however, our investigations have found that some of your information would have been accessible to an unauthorized third party, therefore, it is possible, albeit unlikely, that you could be amongst those whose personal data was taken.

the information relating to you that may have been taken, may be information that is required to open an account with jn bank, such as:

- the name and branch at which you opened an account
- the type of account that you opened
- your personal customer information form
- proof of address
- proof of employment
- copy identification documents

- established a process to help customers through this period, which could include credit remediation and identity protection services, such as lifelock and identity force for a period of 12 months.

we have no evidence that the data that may have been taken was targeted or has been misused. however, we think this kind of incident needs to be treated with caution. given the nature of this information, it is important that we make you aware of the incident and any associated risks.

there is a risk that the data that may have been extracted from our network could be used to attempt to facilitate fraud, identity theft or social engineering attempts. as a result, we recommend that you exercise increased vigilance in all matters relating to your personal and/or business details over the next 12-24 months, and report suspected identity theft incidents to jn bank, law enforcement including your attorney general, and the federal trade commission.

to assist, we are able to offer 12 months of credit and identity monitoring at no cost through a leading credit monitoring service provider. please let us know if you are interested, and we will send you the information and activation codes that you will need to set it up.

re: notice of data event

dear sir or madam:

we represent the northshore utility district (northshore) located at 6830 ne 185th st, kenmore, washington 98028, and are writing to notify your office of an incident that may affect the security of certain customers personally identifiable information. the investigation into this matter is ongoing, and this notice may be supplemented with any new significant facts learned subsequent to its submission.

by providing this notice, northshore does not waive any rights or defenses regarding the applicability of washington law, the applicability of the washington data event notification statute, or personal jurisdiction.

nature of the data event

on february 12, 2020, a northshore employee received an email that appeared to be from a legitimate king county, wa employee. it was discovered that the email contained a link that allowed unknown actors to temporarily gain access to the employee's email account. northshore quickly launched an investigation and began working with computer forensic specialists to determine the full nature and scope of the activity.

the investigation confirmed that one employee email account was accessed without authorization for a limited period of time on february 12, 2020. however, the investigation was unable to determine what, if any, emails and attachments in the account were viewed by the unauthorized actor.

northshore undertook a comprehensive review of the contents of impacted email account to identify those who may have had personal information impacted as a result of this event. this review was completed on or about march 9, 2020.

the personal information impacted by this event may include the following: name, date of birth, drivers license or state id number, payment card information, financial account information, health insurance information, limited medical information, passport number, and social security number. there is no evidence this information was accessed by the unknown actor and northshore is providing notice in an abundance of caution.

notice to washington residents

on or about march 13, 2020, northshore provided preliminary notice of this event to impacted current and former employees via email. a copy of the preliminary email communication is attached hereto as exhibit a.

on or about april 1, 2020, northshore began mailing written notice of this incident to all affected individuals for whom it had sufficient address information, which includes approximately four hundred eighty-three (483) washington residents. written notice is being provided in substantially the same form as the letter attached here as exhibit b.

other steps taken and to be taken

upon discovering the event, northshore moved quickly to investigate and respond to the incident, assess the security of northshore's email environment, and notify potentially affected individuals. northshore is providing individuals with information accessible within the account access to two (2) years of complimentary credit monitoring services through id experts.

northshore is also working to review existing policies and procedures. additionally, northshore is providing impacted individuals with guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud, including advising individuals to report any suspected incidents of identity theft or fraud to their credit card company and/or bank.

northshore is providing individuals with information on how to place a fraud alert and security freeze on one's credit file, the contact details for the national consumer reporting agencies, information on how to obtain a free credit report, a reminder to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports, and encouragement to contact the federal trade commission, their state attorney general, and law enforcement to report attempted or actual identity theft and fraud.

northshore also reported this incident to federal law enforcement and is cooperating as necessary.

notice of data breach

dear sample a. sample,

we are writing to inform you of a recent incident involving unauthorized access to some of our employees' email accounts. while we have no indication that your personal information has been misused, some of your information may have been in an email account that was accessed in this incident. we are writing to make you aware of our current understanding of what happened, measures that have been taken, and to provide you with some steps you can take to protect your personal information.

what happened?

on february 25, 2020, spinrite, inc. (spinrite) learned that an unauthorized party gained access to employee email accounts through a phishing attack. we immediately initiated an investigation and retained a leading computer security firm. during the course of the investigation, we learned that unauthorized connections were made to a limited number of spinrite email accounts between november 29, 2019, and february 25, 2020. we were unable to confirm whether any specific emails or attachments stored within those affected accounts were viewed or acquired as a result of this incident. out of an abundance of caution, we reviewed the emails stored in the affected email accounts to determine whether any of those emails contained personal information. we completed our review of the email accounts on march 23, 2020.

what information was involved?

we have determined that some of your personal information provided to spinrite or to our affiliate coats & clark, inc., was present in an affected email account, including some of the following information: first name, last name, [extra1]. to date, we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information as a result of this incident.

what we are doing?

fraud alerts:

there are two types of fraud alerts you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud—an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. you can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies.

credit freezes:

you have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file, free of charge, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. a security freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent. if you place a security freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a security freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit.

there is no fee to place or lift a security freeze. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a security freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. for information and instructions to place a security freeze, contact each of the credit reporting agencies at the addresses below:

6. a legible photocopy of a government-issued identification card (state driver's license or id card, military identification, etc.)

7. if you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft

the credit reporting agencies have one business day after receiving your request by toll-free telephone or secure electronic means, or three business days after receiving your request by mail, to place a security freeze on your credit report. the credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number ("pin") or password or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze. to lift the security freeze in order to allow a specific entity or individual access to your credit report, or to lift a security freeze for a specified period of time, you must submit a request through	the breach at stockdale radiology was a ransomware attack by an unknown intruder, resulting in the exposure of personal health information including names, addresses, and social security numbers.

on april 1, 2020, oxfam learned of a cyber-security attack involving its network through which an unauthorized party potentially accessed certain personal information, including yours.

what information was involved
while oxfam has not been able to confirm that the unauthorized party viewed your personal information, the information potentially accessed included names, addresses, and social security numbers of oxfam's employees.

what oxfam is doing to address this situation
oxfam takes the security and confidentiality of the personal information entrusted to us very seriously. while oxfam is not aware of and has not received any reports of the access or misuse of your personal information, it has taken the appropriate steps to ensure that your sensitive information has been secured. oxfam is also conducting a thorough investigation into any unauthorized access of your personal information that may have occurred.

as a result of the potential unauthorized access of personal information, oxfam will provide you, if you wish, with access to identity monitoring services provided by infoarmor, an allstate company, at no charge for two years.

how to enroll for the free services
you will need to activate an account online by visiting www.privacyarmor.com/oxfam and clicking "enroll now" or by calling 1-800-789-2720 before may 29, 2020. we have arranged a dedicated call center run by a third party, infoarmor, to assist with questions about how to protect your identity following this incident. you may call infoarmor at 1-800-789-2720 or email at clientservices@infoarmor.com who has a team of privacy advocates available 24/7.

what you can do to address this situation
you may consider placing a security freeze on your credit report. a security freeze prohibits a credit-reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer's credit report without written authorization. however, please be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

to place a security freeze on your credit report, you must contact each of the three major consumer reporting agencies: equifax (www.equifax.com); experian (www.experian.com); and trans union (www.transunion.com):

notice of data breach

april [_____], 2020

dear [patient name],

we value you as a patient, and we would like to thank you for allowing us to assist you with your healthcare needs. unfortunately, a breach of your health information occurred when a former employee accessed your electronic medical record without your authorization and potentially downloaded your information. this letter is meant to inform you of the event, what we are doing, and what you can do to protect yourself.

what happened?

on march 11, 2020, our office was performing a routine audit when we noticed that a former employee, who quit on march 2, 2020, had accessed our electronic medical record system after she had quit. her access was revoked on march 3, 2020. upon discovery, the office immediately performed a thorough audit to determine what information she viewed. while we do not know if she retained your medical information, through an audit of her activity we believe she may have downloaded your medical information. the employee believed she was authorized to access your information in order to file a report with a regulatory agency. out of an abundance of caution, we are informing you of this event.

what information was involved?

while we cannot confirm with certainty what information the former employee may have viewed, we believe she may have viewed your name, date of birth, medical record number, address, telephone number, demographic information, dates of service, email address, brief description of reason for each encounter at our office, treating physicians, referring physicians, past and current diagnoses, active medications, active medical issues, social security number, emergency contact information, insurance information, examination results, consult notes, sexual history, mental health history, family history, treatment plans, and charges to date. the employee confirmed in a signed declaration that she destroyed any personal information in her possession she obtained from this incident.

what we are doing?

as a safeguard, we have arranged for you to enroll, at no cost to you, in an online credit monitoring service (mytrueidentity) for one year provided by transunion interactive, a subsidiary of transunion, one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. to enroll in this service, go to the mytrueidentity website at www.mytrueidentity.com and in the space referenced as enter activation code, enter the following 12-letter activation code [fill in for each patient] and follow the three steps to receive your credit monitoring service online within minutes. you can sign up for the online credit monitoring service anytime between now and july 31, 2020. due to privacy laws, we cannot register you directly. please note that credit monitoring service might not be available for individuals who do not have a credit file with transunion, experian and equifax, or an address in the united states (or its territories) and a valid social security number. enrolling in this service will not affect your credit score.

once you are enrolled, you will be able to obtain one year of unlimited access to your transunion credit report and credit score. the daily three-bureau credit monitoring service will notify you if there are any critical changes to your credit files at transunion, experian and equifax, including fraud alerts, new inquiries, new accounts, new public records, late payments, change of address and more. the service also includes access to an identity restoration program that provides assistance in the event your identity is compromised to help you restore your identity and up to $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance with no deductible. (policy limitations and exclusions may apply.)

if you believe you may be a victim of identity theft, please call the toll-free transunion fraud response services hotline at 1-855-288-5422. when prompted, enter the following 6-digit telephone pass code 697871 to speak to a transunion representative about your identity theft issue.

what you can do?

while the former employee stated that she destroyed any personal information in her possession, it is wise to monitor your credit and request a free credit report from major credit-reporting agencies, such as equifax, experian, or transunion. you may contact equifax at 1-800-685-1111 or equifax.com; experian at 1-888-397-3742 or experian.com; or transunion at 1-800-916-8800 or transunion.com. you may also request your credit report at www.annualcreditreport.com. even if you do not find any suspicious activity on your initial credit reports, the ftc recommends that you check your credit reports periodically.

for more information.

again, we would like to emphasize to you our sincerest apology for this occurrence. we take patient privacy and data security very seriously, and we will ensure no similar event occurs in the future. please do not hesitate to contact us if you need any additional information or have any questions. our address is listed above, and our phone number is (619) 420-0201.

notice of security incident

dear [recipient],

we are writing to inform you about a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. we take the protection and proper use of your information very seriously. for this reason, we are contacting you directly to explain the circumstances of the incident.

what happened?

on march 13, 2020, execupharm experienced a data security incident that compromised select corporate and personnel information. specifically, unknown individuals encrypted execupharm servers and sought a ransom in exchange for decryption. as part of this incident, execupharm employees received phishing emails from the unknown individuals. upon a thorough investigation, execupharm determined that the individuals behind the encryption and the sending of these emails may have accessed and/or shared select personal information relating to execupharm personnel, as well as personal information relating to select personnel of parexel, whose information was stored on execupharm's data network. execupharm has notified federal and local law enforcement authorities in the united states and retained leading third-party cybersecurity firms to investigate the nature and scope of the incident. execupharm is also in the process of notifying the relevant authorities as required.

what information was involved?

we believe the individuals behind this data security incident may have accessed employee files. as a result, the information that may have been involved includes: social security numbers, taxpayer id/ein, driver's license numbers, passport numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, national insurance numbers, national id numbers, iban/swift numbers, and beneficiary information (including social security numbers). for information about what was contained in your employee file, please contact: employeeinquiries@execupharm.com. unauthorized access to such information may potentially lead to the misuse of your personal data to impersonate you and/or to commit, or allow third parties to commit, fraudulent acts such as securing credit in your name.

what we are doing.

execupharm internal teams worked diligently with forensic consultants to rebuild the impacted servers from backup servers and have now fully restored and secured the execupharm systems. this included the installation of forensic tools on all systems and the isolation of impacted systems until execupharm could confirm that they were secure. execupharm also implemented additional countermeasures to block further ransomware emails from entering the execupharm environment. execupharm also upgraded its security measures to prevent future attacks, including forced password resets, multi-factor authentication for remote access, and endpoint protection, detection, and response tools.

additionally, to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of kroll to provide identity monitoring at no cost to you for one year. kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have potentially sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data. your identity monitoring services include credit monitoring, a current credit report, web watcher, public persona, quick cash scan, $1 million identity fraud loss reimbursement, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. visit https://enroll.idheadquarters.com to activate and take advantage of your identity monitoring services. you have until july 31, 2020, to activate your identity monitoring services. if you have already activated these services, no further action on identity monitoring services is required, though we encourage you to review the additional resources section below for further steps you can take to help protect yourself.

monitoring: you should always remain vigilant and monitor your accounts for suspicious or unusual activity.

security freeze: a security freeze is intended to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. to place a security freeze on your credit report, each credit reporting agency has a dedicated web page for security freezes and fraud alerts, or you can request a freeze by phone or by mail. the following information must be included when requesting a security freeze (note that if you are requesting a credit report for your spouse, this information must be provided for him/her as well):

tips to safeguard personal information

protecting your accounts:

monitor your account statements often (even daily in online banking) to review all charges and transactions. contact us immediately at 1-800-to-wells (1-800-869-3557) 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week, if you see discrepancies or unauthorized activity on your wells fargo accounts. we will carefully review them for reimbursement in accordance with our policies.

if available, consider placing password protection on your wells fargo accounts, and do not use any part of your social security number as the username or password. to find out if password protection is available for your accounts, visit any wells fargo branch. or we can help you close these accounts and transfer the money to new accounts. for this option, please call us at 1-800-to-wells (1-800-869-3557), 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week, or visit any wells fargo branch.

for more tips on how to protect your wells fargo accounts, please visit www.wellsfargo.com/privacy_security

do not write down or share your personal identification number (pin) number or passwords with anyone. if you receive suspicious emails that claim to be from wells fargo, forward them to reportphish@wellsfargo.com and then delete them.

if you have accounts at other financial institutions, please notify them and they can advise you on additional steps to take.

if your user name or email address, with a password or security question and answer that would permit access to an online account were involved, promptly change your user name or password and security question or answer, as applicable, or take other appropriate steps to protect online accounts for which you use the same user name or email address and password or security question and answer.

protecting your identity:

place a fraud alert on your credit file. a fraud alert tells creditors to contact you before they open any new accounts or change your existing accounts. call any one of the three major credit bureaus listed on the back of this page. as soon as one credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts. this provides a significant layer of protection; however, it may limit your ability to get instant credit such as the offers often available at retail branches.

check your credit report to ensure all your information is correct. you can obtain a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus every 12 months by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com or calling 1-877-322-8228.

if you believe you are a victim of identity theft, report it to your local law enforcement agency and to the federal trade commission (ftc) or your state attorney general.

you also may want to consider placing a freeze on your credit file. a credit freeze means potential creditors cannot get your credit report and makes it less likely that an identity thief can open new accounts in your name. to place a freeze on your credit you can contact the nationwide credit bureaus. you can freeze your credit for free, but you'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, social security number and other personal information. after receiving your freeze request, each credit bureau will provide you with a unique pin (personal identification number) or password. keep the pin or password in a safe place. you will need it if you choose to lift the freeze. to lift the freeze, you will need to contact the credit bureaus again.

information on how to contact the major credit bureaus, the ftc and attorneys general can be found on the back of this page.

notice of data breach

a.b. closing, inc. d/b/a kavaliro (kavaliro) recently discovered a data security incident that involved the compromise of certain kavaliro business email and file sharing systems. this notice is being provided as a precaution to inform potentially affected individuals about the incident and to provide some steps that can be taken to help protect themselves.

this notification has not been delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation, and we sincerely regret any concern this notification may cause you.

what happened:
in march 2020, kavaliro became aware of unauthorized persons who were using an imposter domain name to conduct email phishing directed at kavaliro's customers. kavaliro has since had the imposter domain taken down, and while investigating the imposter domain, on march 26, 2020, became aware of unauthorized access to several kavaliro email accounts by those involved with the imposter domain. on april 11, 2020, kavaliro was able to determine that there was also unauthorized access to multiple additional kavaliro email accounts, as well as certain internal file management systems.

kavaliro is unable to determine the specific time and date that the unauthorized access began or the exact number of affected individuals, but kavaliro believes the unauthorized access began with two accounts in september 2019 and expanded to multiple accounts in march 2020. the unauthorized access continued through march 29, 2020.

what information was involved:
the email accounts and file sharing systems at issue may have contained personally identifiable information present in the email accounts or internal file management systems at kavaliro, including but not limited to names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, usernames, passwords, financial account information, and certain demographic information.

what we are doing:
kavaliro takes privacy very seriously and deeply regrets this incident. after kavaliro learned of this incident, it initiated a comprehensive it security investigation and hired an independent forensic cybersecurity investigation firm to assist in its investigation and response. kavaliro also notified the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) and will continue to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation.

kavaliro enabled multi-factor authentication on its business systems, blocked certain foreign ip addresses, conducted global password resets, and is working continually to harden its information security infrastructure and technological practices to better prevent any future unauthorized access to its information systems.

as a precaution, and to reduce the risk that any client information could be misused, kavaliro is offering potentially impacted individuals one year of identity monitoring services at no cost through kroll, to include credit monitoring, fraud consultation, and identity theft restoration. kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data. the offer is available to potentially affected individuals whose information may have been in kavaliro's compromised accounts at any time between september 1, 2019, and march 31, 2020. qualifying individuals can learn more or request membership information by calling the call center at 844-978-2448. once a membership number is received, you will receive activation instructions by mail and have until july 23, 2020, to activate your identity monitoring services. additional information describing kroll's services is included below in the additional resources section.

what you can do:
for tips on how to help protect yourself, please review the additional resources reference guide included below. this section includes steps you may wish to take to help protect yourself, including recommendations by the federal trade commission regarding identity theft protection, monitoring account statements and free credit reports, and details on placing a fraud alert or a security freeze on your credit file.

for more information:
for more information about this incident, or if you have additional questions or concerns, you may contact our dedicated call center directly at 844-978-2448 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. eastern time, excluding major us holidays. again, we sincerely regret any concern this incident may cause you.

additional resources
review accounts and credit reports: you can also regularly review statements from your accounts and periodically obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit reporting companies. you may obtain a free copy of your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by mailing an annual credit report request form (available at www.annualcreditreport.com) to: annual credit report request service, p.o. box 105281, atlanta, ga, 30348-5281. you may also purchase a copy of your credit report by contacting one or more of the three national credit reporting agencies listed below.

you should remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports, and you should promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and the federal trade commission (ftc). you may contact the ftc or your state's regulatory authority to obtain additional information about preventing identity theft: federal trade commission, bureau of consumer protection, 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20580, 1-877-idtheft (438-4338), www.ftc.gov/idtheft. north carolina residents may also contact the north carolina attorney general's office: 9001 mail service center, raleigh, north carolina 27699; 1-877-5-no-scam; https://www.ncdoj.gov/protectingconsumers/.

fraud alerts: there are also two types of fraud alerts that you can place on your credit report to put your creditors on notice that you may be a victim of fraud: an initial alert and an extended alert. you may ask that an initial fraud alert be placed on your credit report if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. an initial fraud alert stays on your credit report for one year. you may have an extended alert placed on your credit report if you have already been a victim of identity theft with the appropriate documentary proof. an extended fraud alert stays on your credit report for seven years. you can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting any of the three national credit reporting agencies at the addresses or toll-free numbers listed at the bottom of this page.

credit freezes: you may have the right to put a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, on your credit file so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. a credit freeze is designed to prevent potential credit grantors from accessing your credit report without your consent and shall be provided free of charge. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. unlike a fraud alert, you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company. since laws may differ from state to state, please contact the three major credit reporting companies as specified below to find out more information.

you can obtain more information about fraud alerts and credit freezes by contacting the ftc or one of the national credit reporting agencies listed below.

what you should do to protect your personal information

we recommend you remain vigilant and consider taking one or more of the following steps to avoid identity theft, obtain additional information, and protect your personal information:

1. contacting the nationwide credit-reporting agencies as soon as possible to:

- add a fraud alert statement to your credit file at all three national credit-reporting agencies: equifax, experian, and transunion. this statement alerts creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report as well as requests that they contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. once the fraud alert is added to your credit report, all creditors should contact you prior to establishing any account in your name. you only need to contact one of the three agencies listed below; your request will be shared with the other two agencies. this fraud alert will remain on your credit file for 90 days.
- place a security freeze on your credit account. this means that your credit account cannot be shared with potential creditors. a security freeze can help prevent new account identity theft. if you would like to request a security freeze be placed on your account, you must write by certified or overnight mail (see addresses below) to each of the three credit reporting agencies, or through the electronic or internet method made available by the credit reporting agencies.
- remove your name from mailing lists of pre-approved offers of credit for approximately six months.
- receive a free copy of your credit report by going to www.annualcreditreport.com.

at community memorial health system (cmhs), we value our employees and protecting your personal information is our priority. we are writing to let you know about a data security incident involving your personal information.

what happened?

we were notified by paperlesspay corporation (paperlesspay) in a letter dated march 20, 2020, that on february 19, 2020, they were contacted by the department of homeland security (dhs) regarding a possible breach of their systems. paperlesspay is a vendor hired by cmhs to house pay stubs and assist with w-2 forms. dhs notified paperlesspay that there was an unknown person purporting to sell access to their client database on the dark web. in response, paperlesspay shut down their web server and sql server to prevent potential unauthorized access. during this time, cmhs and its employees experienced an interruption in service for a short amount of time while their servers were offline.

over the following weeks, paperlesspay cooperated with the joint investigation conducted by dhs and the federal bureau of investigation (fbi). in addition, paperlesspay retained a cybersecurity firm to help with their own internal forensic investigation of the incident. through these investigations, paperlesspay confirmed that the unauthorized person gained access to their sql server, where data is stored, on february 18, 2020. the available evidence has not, however, allowed dhs, the fbi, or the security firm to determine what data the person may have accessed or viewed while connected to the sql server.

what information was involved?

the impacted server stored pay stub and tax forms that contain name, address, pay and withholdings information, bank account number information (if this appears on your paystub), and social security number. with respect to bank account information, note that bank information for employees who receive a single deposit was not provided to paperlesspay. bank account information is, however, provided for those employees who receive multiple deposits. specifically, for multiple deposit employees, paperlesspay would have had access to a full bank account number for each account that is being deposited, but not to bank account routing numbers or bank names.

you may put a credit freeze (or security freeze) on your credit file, so that no new credit can be opened in your name without the use of a pin number that is issued to you when you initiate a freeze. if you place a credit freeze, potential creditors and other third parties will not be able to get access to your credit report unless you temporarily lift the freeze. therefore, using a credit freeze may delay your ability to obtain credit. credit freeze laws vary from state to state, but there is no cost anywhere in the country for freezing or unfreezing your credit file. you must separately place a credit freeze on your credit file at each credit reporting company, and may need to provide the following information: (1) full name, middle initial and any suffixes; (2) social security number; (3) complete addresses for past 2 years; (4) date of birth; (5) a copy of a government-issued identification card; (6) proof of your current address (such as a utility bill or telephone bill); and (7) proof of your identity (such as a copy of your social security card, pay stub with social security number, or w2 or 1099 form).

as a reminder, it is always a good practice to remain vigilant with respect to reviewing your account statements and credit reports from one or more of the national credit reporting agencies above, and to promptly report any suspicious activity or suspected identity theft to us and to the proper law enforcement authorities, including local law enforcement, your state's attorney general, and/or the federal trade commission (ftc). for more information about credit freezes, fraud alerts, and other steps you can take to prevent identity theft, you can contact the national credit reporting agencies or the ftc, at 600 pennsylvania avenue, nw, washington, dc 20580; 1-877-id-theft (438-4338); or www.ftc.gov/idtheft.

dear [employee name],

notice of data breach

what happened?

marshall medical center (mmc) uses an outside vendor called paperlesspay to produce electronic paystubs and w2 forms for employees. on march 20, 2020, paperlesspay contacted mmc that on february 19, 2020, the department of homeland security (dhs) contacted paperlesspay that an unknown person was purporting to sell access to paperlesspay's client database on the dark web. in response, paperlesspay shut down its web server and database to prevent any potential unauthorized access. this interrupted services to mmc employees and prevented you from accessing payroll records for a short amount of time while the servers were offline. paperlesspay does not have any role in the actual direct deposit process of paychecks, so that process was not impacted.

over the following weeks, paperlesspay cooperated with the joint investigation conducted by dhs and the federal bureau of investigation (fbi). their investigation is ongoing, and paperlesspay will continue to cooperate. in addition, paperlesspay retained the cybersecurity firm ankura to help with its own, internal forensic investigation of the incident.

through these investigations, paperlesspay confirmed that an unknown person (the hacker) on february 18, 2020, accessed paperlesspay's database where mmc employees' data was stored. the available evidence has not, however, allowed dhs, the fbi, or ankura to determine what data the hacker may have accessed or viewed while connected to the database. it is possible the hacker only used access to determine the size of the database and to stage it for subsequent access that could be sold to others, and that the hacker did not directly access any employee data.

the security system also has an alert system that is configured to detect data file transfers that exceed 1gb in size, and no alert was triggered during this security incident event. however, the hacker would have had the capability to run queries against the database and view its data, so we cannot rule out the possibility of unauthorized access or acquisition.

what information was involved?

the information stored in paperlesspay's database regarding mmc employees consists of the data elements that appear on employee pay stubs and tax forms, including name, address, pay and withholdings, and social security number. however, these data elements are stored on the database in different tables that are associated by user id numbers, not names, within each database table. therefore, the only way to associate any data with an individual would be to run a query against the database and have it aggregate an individual's name with his or her other data components.

what we are doing.

paperlesspay has acted to secure their network and prevent future incidents. to resume their services, paperlesspay rebuilt a new domain controller, a new web server, and a new database server to start with a clean slate. furthermore, paperlesspay then restored database files to the new database server from backups. new ip addresses were assigned to all the new servers, and passwords for users and administrators were changed. these actions forced all clients to change their passwords when they log in for the first time and disabled all remote access capabilities to the new web server and database server.

paperlesspay also installed an endpoint detection and response (edr) application called carbon black on the new servers and other endpoints within its network. this has allowed paperlesspay to monitor all activity while it completed its investigation of the incident. to date since carbon black has been running, there have been no indicators of compromise detected in the newly rebuilt environment, and paperlesspay has reported that all customer services are functioning as normal.

based on the information paperlesspay has shared with mmc about this event, mmc has decided to stop sending any more information to this vendor going forward. the previous data for estubs and w2s will still be available through the paperlesspay portal until we determine a better method for access. for a period of time, mmc will be going back to producing paper paystubs until we can go live on our new payroll system. mmc has purchased a new payroll system through a company called workday and is building this system for go-live this fall. the new payroll system will have an employee portal where employees will be able to access their paystubs and w2 and will be included in the overall business system for the organization.

what you can do.

there are additional actions you can consider taking to reduce the chances of identity theft or fraud on your account(s).

additional actions to help reduce your chances of identity theft

- place a 90-day fraud alert on your credit file: an initial 90-day security alert indicates to anyone requesting your credit file that you suspect you are a victim of fraud. when you or someone else attempts to open a credit account in your name, increase the credit limit on an existing account, or obtain a new card on an existing account, the lender should take steps to verify that you have authorized the request. if the creditor cannot verify this, the request should not be satisfied. you may contact one of the credit reporting companies below for assistance.

experian 1-888-397-3742 www.experian.com

transunion 1-800-680-7289 www.transunion.com

- place a security freeze on your credit file: if you are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft, a security freeze might be right for you. placing a freeze on your credit report will prevent lenders and others from accessing your credit report entirely, which will prevent them from extending credit. with a security freeze in place, you will be required to take special steps when you wish to apply for any type of credit. this process is also completed through each of the credit reporting companies.
- order your free annual credit reports: visit www.annualcreditreport.com or call 877-322-8228. once you receive your credit reports, review them for discrepancies. identify any accounts you did not open or inquiries from creditors that you did not authorize. verify all information is correct. if you have questions or notice incorrect information, contact the credit reporting company.
- manage your personal information: take steps such as carrying only essential documents with you, being aware of whom you are sharing your personal information with, and shredding receipts, statements, and other sensitive information.
- use tools from credit providers: carefully review your credit reports and bank, credit card, and other account statements. be proactive and create alerts on credit cards and bank accounts to notify you of activity. if you discover unauthorized or suspicious activity on your credit report or by any other means, file an identity theft report with your local police and contact a credit reporting company.
