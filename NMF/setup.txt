INSTRUCTIONS:

0. Open terminal in PyCharm: cd C:\Users\path\to\nmf
1. Run NMF routines: C:\Python27\python.exe .\BatchDriver.py
2. (optional) Update/check K, H, fn in make_graph_script2.py
3. (optional) Generate file for Gephi: C:\Python27\python.exe .\make_graph_script2.py
4. (optional) Start Gephi
-- Open Graph File
-- Layout: Force Atlas -> Run -> Stop
-- Community detection -> Modularity -> run
-- Appearance -> Nodes -> partition -> color -> Modularity class 
-- Labels
-- Preview 
-- Export

Setup steps:
- Install sublime text editor for basic stuff: notes, veiwing files etc.
- Install Pycharm community edition to work with Python in detail
- Install Python 2 to run my old files

- Started by running old unit tests: nmf/TestPreprocess.py
-- Needed to install numpy 
--- C:\Python27\Scripts>.\pip.exe install numpy
-- made new directory C:\Temp
-- Made configuration in PyCharm "TestPreprocess.py" to run unit test
-- installed nltk package
---- could not build "regex" package from C code
---- installed prebuilt binary from: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
---- C:\Python27\Scripts>.\pip.exe install C:\Users\lisah\Downloads\regex-2020.1.8-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl
---- saw this error "print("%*s" % (width, samples[i]), end=" ")", print() is for Python 3, not Python 2
---- googled, tried C:\Python27\Scripts>.\pip.exe install nltk==3.4.5
-- changed all iopro. to np.
-- commented out iopro import

- Started running old TestNMF.py file 
-- Commented out all tests except test_sparse b/c that is the only trustworthy approach
-- made new pycharm run configuration "TestNMF.py"
-- installed scipy: C:\Python27\Scripts>.\pip.exe install scipy
-- installed matplotlib: C:\Python27\Scripts>.\pip.exe install matplotlib
-- installed scikit-learn: C:\Python27\Scripts>.\pip.exe install scikit-learn
-- changed NMF.py line 341: err = np.zeros(int(np.floor(max_iter/check_iter)))
-- changed NMF.py line 276: err[0:int(np.floor(best_iter/check_iter))], 'bo-')
-- changed all iopro. to np.
-- commented out iopro import

- Started running old TestPostprocess.py
-- installed pandas: C:\Python27\Scripts>.\pip.exe install pandas
-- changed all iopro. to np.
-- commented out iopro import
-- changed line 204: segmenter = cluster.KMeans(init='k-means++', n_clusters=5, n_init=3)

- BatchDriver.py
-- changed all iopro. to np.
-- commented out iopro import

- Created new simple script for generating Gephi file: make_graph_script2.py

- install Gephi

- installed nltk wordnet for stemming, from python terminal: 
  >>> import nltk
  >>> nltk.download('wordnet')
- select wordnet, install

Notes
> Executables and files/folders for the programs are all in nmf
> results will be stored on c:\temp
> training data is in desktop\nmf 
> rai - responsible ai - currently has 4 things combined into one corpus (aka training data)
> batchDriver is the executable that runs preproscessing, nmf, and post-processing which are all threaded 
>PREPROCESSING
>1. lower case
>2. cleaning characters\entity extraction ex) computer vision -> computervision so its one token
>BatchDriver.py - threshold=5 keep; play with n_features starting 95 and up until error diverges
